He promises to make something for her as part of their date, but when she says she doesn\\'t have anything important to give him, he tells her: \"Of course I want something It\\'s important to me\" . The two then decide to play hide-and-seek at the park while going on their park date. In order to hide, however, the UM has to pretend to drown himself in the river. After nearly drowning himself, he realizes that his feet are getting numb, so he decides to run away. While running away, he hides behind a dumpster. When he sees another girl approaching, he asks her what she needs help with. What do you need help with? The girl is coming this way What girl? You? Yeah like that You found me! Your turn to hide.

(Removing \"You: \" and \"Me: \" tags along with extra empty space) In this chapter, the narrator introduces himself to his \"female waifu girlfriend\" who loves him so much that she wants to go on her first date with him. On their first date, the two lovebirds exchange pleasantries and go on a walk. On the way home the narrator notes that half of his listeners don\\'t like him, but \"all of me loves you.\" The narrator gets his girlfriend to write down the details of their date so that he can remember it.entia It\\'s a gift from your girlfriend What is?
