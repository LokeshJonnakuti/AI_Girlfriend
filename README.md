# Summary
This repo contains code for an AI girlfriend which can be run using the "main.ipynb" files in the root directory.
All other files are either support or depreciated.

The depreciated directory contains files I worked on to get to the final version of the repository.
I thought it may contains some useful info and I decided not to delete it.
