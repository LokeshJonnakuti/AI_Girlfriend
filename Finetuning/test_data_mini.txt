What a terrific sight!
So this is the Paris Exposition!
Look over there! Number 1 aircraft is getting ready to take off.
Wind force two... with the wind eight meters.
This aircraft has been flown over Dover in England.
It'll be evening then.
I guess so. It'll be evening then.
It's still early, but let's take the aircraft out of the boat, okay?
We could go look for your father,
I haven't forgotten!
It's her all right.
Africa the same as you?
If we could only fly, we could go searching.
Now, don't keep looking so grim.
King, let's go.
Anytime!
After them!
Like an acrobat and that funny cat...
No more rough stuff.
Circus master!
Every girl likes flowers.
Now, shall we go?
I tried to be nice to her and see what happens!
Don't worry. They can't catch us on foot.
Don't worry. They can't catch us on foot.
Amazing! An iron covered wagon? I wonder who invented that?
I know what to do.
Nadia!
Is it ready to fly?
We're flying at top speed already.
Jean!
Come on, climb!
Wait a second. Oh, they're made of paper.
Stop!
What? Haven't I told you yet?
Say, why don't you come to Le Havre with me!
I have an uncle there.
That's wonderful! We'll go on ahead.
Be careful now!

Iroha Igarashi. She always cuts class, she's gaudy, sleazy, and disliked by the girls.
It's like everything I hate the most about 3D girls all put together into one person.
What the hell is this situation?!
If anything, humans with no sense of virtue like you sincerely despise me!
That's right, when I think about it people like this were the ones who were cruel to me in junior high.
What's up, Tsutsui? Your attacks are looking rough.
Stop it...
Tsutsun, sorry I kept you waiting!
Wow, your angry face is even worse... How sad.
I-idiot!
Whoa...
Bye-bye.
Could she possibly... be a good person?
Bastard!
I was afraid of interacting with people.
This is the first time I've felt this way...
Even if you apologize or go on as normal, I have a feeling that I'll somehow be miserable.
Even so, she helped us out, right? And yet you say those things...
Why...?
What?! I-I'm calling the police!
I know, because I was with her the whole time!
Don't get reckless, now.
Look, you're a gloomy boy, so I think you can at least study.
Even if I lose my pride, it's fine!
Half a year... Am I ultimately just wasting time?
Huh? Uh, yeah...
Tsutsun.
What are you doing on Sunday?
But we can see each other at school tomorrow.
Suddenly it's just the two of us in a locked room as if this is some manga or anime or something!
Hello. How are you feeling?
U-uh, I-
Iroha Igarashi! Do you know her?
On Sunday, I saw you and her walking together.
Please treat her properly.
You can tell by looking at me, right?
More importantly...
I... have a serious illness.
Last night, after Tsutsui watched our movie,
Huh?!
I don't like cream and stuff.
H-Hikari's brought a girl?!
I've seen ones like these on TV!
Huh?!
Oh, I just wanted to touch your hair.
Let's go! Not after school, but let's go right now!
Tsutsun!
How do you feel?
Then let's ride that one!
Huh?
No, no! You should go make a proper visit!
Oh! Ayado said that she likes NoBla too.
It's fine...
Are mo kore mo daijoubu sa Everything will be all right
Is this, perhaps... the blossoming of youth?
Wh-what are you talking about?! There's no youth blossoming anywhere around here!
Tsutsun!
You look like you're having a tough time.
I do!
Huh?
No, that's why I took measures to meet at the venue...
It's okay, it's okay!
That guy...
I'll go!
It was a whole lot of fun!
A picnic?
I already know. I was thinking the same thing about Ito...
I mean, I was hoping that I could be a really great assist somehow o-
You idiot! You're awful! So insensitive!
I'm angry because of that!
O-ohhhhh...
I think that part of you is no good, Tsutsun. Really.
That one's mine!
I know that. Since it's you, you were trying to help me, right?
N-now I've done it. My thoughtlessness has once again been activated!
No wa- That's so stupid!
The door is closing.
I don't know what to do and it hurts...
What do I do...?
I mean, Ayado likes you,
You idiot...
I'm sorry my younger brother did something so weird out of the blue.
Her brother... he's her brother... that's great, but...
I came home because I was worried about you.
Uwabe kazarazu hanasetara na... an1If only I could talk to you without putting on airs...

Saa sugu doa akete Come on, open the door now
Sugoku kantan na koto nan jan ne That's not a super easy thing, right?
There's a commotion amongst the girls some reason...
You're the one that did this!
Daremo shiranai koto nanda Is something nobody knows
Well... He is her brother, so he can't be a bad person.
Please be careful on your way home.
Yeah... Let's all go together.
That's rude!
So cute! What is this sense of omnipotence?
And that gift gave her so much joy.
Something wrong? You're just standing there.
And Takanashi says he'll pay!
He's been busy lately. I wonder what he's doing.
Maybe she's on a walk today.
He's actually just putting distance between you two, right?
Chika. In a family, there are things that are okay and things that are not okay for a brother to do.
You know, we aren't blood-related.
Then I hope it goes as well as possible,
Send it back! Pass! Pass it!
I'm okay with it.
Isn't that for your sake and not for others?
You hit Cat Ears!
Is that so?
Yeah.
Sorry. I wanted to work more and buy you something better,
Thank you, Tsutsun.
Yume ga same sora nagamete omou I wake from a dream and gaze at the sky

Hora mijukumono Hey, the inexperienced
an5Oh, Tsutsui's paying... Gonna go eat somewhere else? Huh? You're right...
On to the next spot! No, it's okay. It's fine. I've got this!
And I have a best friend, and even something kind of like a female friend.
That time of year already?
Of course we do!
Tsutsui got the job!
an3-Ito
Ugh, I hate this committee stuff... I wish I could quit.
I'll take your spot, Takeda!
You're pretty heartless, you know that?
W-we can do it!
But...
I'm so happy!
So I'm going to have to grow them with more love than ever.
Maybe something like, "Go raise those experience points!"
I have to be brave now.
Ito-senpai?
Ayado...
So I know that telling you this is only going to put you on the spot.
and got rejected for the first time.
Right now, I don't have the tiniest bit of energy left for that kind of thing, so...
I'm sorry.
She turned me down.
I don't know what's going on, but this is ticking me off.
I wonder why.
I fell in love, and I thought: "Wow, love is painful."
Ishino, can't you speak words of comfort?!
Do you have any idea how many times I've been rejected?
Sounds fun! I say we do it!
That settles it!
That okay with you, committee members?
I'm... going to go outside and get some fresh air. Don't be such a spoil sport!
I'm... going to go outside and get some fresh air. It goes against otaku principles!
Ugh, you're so annoying!
What are you doing all the way up here?
Um... can't...
I want to be a better person, too.
And your cat ears?!
But I'm proud of you for being so positive.
Yeah, she restored a lot of my HP.
now they think they can ask for my help!
You're guaranteed to get first place.
I'm saying I don't want to get first place!
Th-they're fine, thanks for asking!
Really? So Igarashi entered after all.
an5I let myself get excited about being positive, and reality slapped me in the face. If you want to be a better man that badly,
It's our job to instantly create an atmosphere where they can relax and enjoy themselves with all their hearts!
I'm supposed to judge her?
The pencil sketch is so much better than I imagined...
You're really good, Tsutsui!
But you've changed, Tsutsui.
No!
an5Yo. Hi! Hey there!
It feels like I'm...
But...
So cute...
I gave myself a stomachache building."
General Manager!
I won't. There's still the beauty contest.
Right now, sales are pretty high, thanks to Ito's hard work.
Okay...
The voting system you made for us is a real life saver.
How many votes do I have so far?
And you thought you stood a chance?
And the one vote I do have is my own! That's right, laugh! Go on!
Hang in there, Ishino.
Yeah.
That was Miss Hirata from Class 2-B!
since you all voted for me I think it would just be the best if I could repay you by winning the whole contest!
Will she be okay?
Nope, I can't keep this up...
I know...
I felt someone as conniving as you would be able to make all our dreams come true.
The way you can't drink carbonated drinks.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was alright.
I know I didn't win the beauty contest...
P-please forget everything!
Good work on the school festival!
Why were they acting like that?
I don't know if it's safe to ask.
Just a hunch.
Yay!
Yoga.
You shouldn't tell such obvious lies.
I told you, it's me!
How rude.
All I can do is stand back and watch.
What should we do?
What?! No, but they were talking about...
Were you listening...?
Uh, hey! Hikari!
Dammit! I really wish I didn't have this secret!
Wh-what's going on?
It's not what you think. I bet it was just a friend from work!
"Just a friend from work" wouldn't send an email with that many emojis!
It really was the calm before the storm.
But even when he was so busy, he came home late every night.
Hikari, you or Kaoru will be coming with your mother.
For dragging you out here.
I'm the worst.
When she saw me in the hall, she wouldn't even look me in the eye.
How could I have been so thoughtless?
No, sorry. It's okay.
Oh, Hikari. Welcome home.
an4To explain: His father has been camping out in the living room since the argument
Is that what you think?
I never had the right to argue.
She raised two strong kids.
And I just figured, maybe I can't ask for any more than that.
Wow. He thinks just like I do.
I still love her.
If she said that to me, I'm pretty sure I would be paralyzed, too.
M-Mom and Dad say they're getting a divorce.
Kaoru wants tempura.
Sorry, Kaoru!
Your father told me he was glad.
There's too much good food in Oshamambe.
Crab and rice, crab cakes...
I'm begging you!
Have a nice life in Oshamambe.
What?! Nothing's official yet!
That's not what I meant!
But I hate it!
We could try remembering that song
Yes, if we're together, even the sad things
Would you like some?
Oh, no, he's the most trustworthy person I know, and I actually love everything about him.
That makes sense.
Do you think it's even possible to regain a lost bond?
I don't want to believe that a bond like that can be broken so easily.
Oh, I'm sorry about that! I didn't even answer the question.
I think I can see why Hikari wants to stay here with you.
No, Dad hasn't done a single thing.
Anyway, come inside.
Um? Excuse me?
I just loved the Chief so much, I couldn't stop myself.
You destroyed his family! "I loved him" is not going to cut it!
He told me I didn't have to talk to him anymore.
Good.
But what if he doesn't like me-
Well, you know. Like s-sleepovers?
"Oh, what a relief!" Is that what I'm supposed to say?
How much takoyaki have you eaten today?
If Mom had been there, it would have been a catastrophe!
I was terrified!
I'm sorry!
Owww.
No. I'm a gluemaker.
My lab is in a building near here.
I don't even know her name,
I was bad at my job.
When I don't even really know you?
Your mother and I got to know each other and eventually got married.
I've already heard it.
Going out to dinner helped me realize how very precious each of them is to me.
Kie.
But...
Why did you ignore me?!
In this episode, I will be doing the honors of providing some narration.
Welcome back, Sumie.
I'll go get a vase!
Sumi, you know I don't really understand any of that stuff.
even if I had to lie about it.
I'm so sorry.
So it all worked out with you two?!
And thank you for always being there to listen to me, Ishino-senpai.
My peaceful life has returned.
I made a ton of oden!
Yes, ma'am!
N-no, please stop.
Kaoru! Don't say those things! You'll bring Iroha back to her senses!
A-are you stupid?!
My first... boyfriend.
After all that, why?
Thanks for waiting, Ayado!
Does this mean now I get to experience it all with Ito-senpai?
Um, Ayado?
Really?
Ayado, is it possible that you're having second thoughts about dating me?
You've been pushing yourself all day.
If you're thinking that you have to fall in love with me now that we're dating, then don't worry.
You can think it over. Figure out what you really want before we start doing this.
And he's told me so many times that he loves me!
Senpai!
You shouldn't have to hold anything back, either, Ayado.
Boku no te o hiiteta Boku no te o hiiteta
What a relief.
It's normal for you, Ishino.
Right now, I'm happy just having a few sexy girls I can hook up with from time to time.
The world alone moves forward, erasing the past
There, just keep doing that.
Wh-what is your problem?
T..Takanashi-senpai?
The start of a relationship is an important time, so give them their space.
I'm interested.
Excuse me! Could I get some rice on the side?
I don't have anything worth using energy on.
What, you have a problem?
It was your idea! Try to be excited!
My mom wants to know if you want to come over for dinner again sometime.
Yeah.
I'd like to have hotpot again.
You like hotpot?
And when we have crab cream croquettes, the rule is we have to call Mom a god.
Yeah.
Don't you have a smaller one? Something more easily portable.
No.
Such a beautiful, decent girl is actually your girlfriend.
I'm taking notes. Tell me what you've done with her, and give me specifics.
This does NOT look like Kirara!
It's none of your business, Ishino.
Ugh.
Hello?
What?
What?! Really?!
I mean...
Any ideas? Where else would she go?
I guess...
I was too hard on Anzu.
Yeah.
Do you think I hurt her?
Takanashi!
I'm a little nervous, but you're here, so I know I'll be okay.
Seriously...
Anyway, I'm glad we found them!
That reminds me, I was mad at you!
A cell phone cover?!
an5What are you doing on our next day off?
Our next day off, huh...?
The white breath is the fading future future
Is more wonderful than anything
I don't need anything. Now let's go
How are things going with you and your ugly four-eyed friend?
"The other day"?
What are you, in fourth grade?
You never used to wear sweats around the house.
Put on some sweats, for crying out loud!
Takanashi!
I wanted to talk to you about something. Do you have time?
See you tomorrow!
Earth to Tsutsun!
What's wrong, Ito?
Th-that's a good point.
O-oh. Right.
Takanashi... and me.
Wait a minute! How are you so sure I haven't done it yet?!
That last date was pretty much the least sexy thing ever.
Ariel!
It wasn't easy, either!
So, Ariel, what's your real name?
Okay, Arisa.
then plunged me into the depths of despair.
You wouldn't mind being friends, would you?
Tsutsui!
Oops, I forgot something! Sorry, go on without me!
That's okay! W-w-w-w-w-we don't have any experience with that!
What is wrong with me?
Nothing! Everyone goes at their own pace!
Our hearts have been thirsty for so long,
And we're going to keep changing. We're not done.
I wonder how long I'll be around to see how you change.
You said whatever I want. Just a minute ago, you promised.
You little-!
But then I found out that she doesn't have a father.
I was thinking of taking Arisa there today.
I don't care.
Why are you so excited to talk about other people?!
I don't want things to be like that between us.
So stop whining to me and go to her!
Try and have some tact, woman!
You're making it too much of a chore!
Okay.
Tsutsun.
an5Kamakura
She marked a lot of pages.
an8Kamakura
And what have I been thinking about all this time?
Am I stupid?!
A day isn't long enough to tell my tale. You still want to know?
And I know a ton more restaurants, too!
Hey, do you want to hang out over the long weekend?
Okay. Sure.
I wonder what was going through her mind when she asked me to go on a trip.
I just kept thinking about how to get out of it.
Kurikaeshi demo furidashi demo ii mujaki ni misete
Y-you weren't.
Wait.
Look.
And right over the three-day weekend.
B-but I can just skip those!
No one will notice me. I know that
As if nothing ever happened,
But didn't fade away that day
an8Chuo General Hospital
an8Phew...
Anzu, what do you want for dinner tonight?
H-hijiki?
Oh, it's just a mild concussion.
So it's just you and Anzu for three days?
What's that?
Let's go.
B-between the legs...?
I know for a fact that your head will be full of all kinds of freaky ideas.
This is unusual.
Are you done?
You do anything to her, and I will kill you.
Here, Anzu. If you would do the honors.
Thank you very much!
Yeah.
Because you say so, it's true?
No.
Actually, I wanted to go to an amusement park with Kaoru, but-
Make up and be friends!
It's okay.
Really. You're a good kid, Anzu.
See? Best buds!
Oh, and I already have plans for the long weekend.
So the long weekend... you're going somewhere with Sakurada?
No, I mean it in the "my pet is running away" sense.
I'm sorry, Anzu. See you later.
Anzu, you can go to the amusement park.
Ishino.
What? It is?
She's going to come over to my house for dinner.
Here goes!
They said they want you to make yourself at home, so you're welcome to stay.
I've gotten 100 on this game.
How many times are you going to make me play against you?!
We've been playing video games for four hours.
But in reality, she's just been trying so hard on her own.
it starts to get sticky, and forms a kind of paste.
That's really good! It's different than our usual gyoza!
Or maybe because we made them together.
We're happy to have you.
I think so, too!
That's the octopus gyoza. And that one's squid.
It's a lot of fun being with them.
Goodnight, Tsutsun.
an5Chuo General Hospital
But it has to stop.
You know I already gave in and indulged you once.
Tsutsun.
There's nothing to worry about
We're dating, after all.
If you want to, Tsutsun, it's okay.
What? Was that a dream?
This is the first time I've seen Ito looking so sad!
Why in the world are you trying to watch out for me?
Matter of fact, you can even talk all about your love life, as much as you want!
No.
It's nothing.
Like how?!
That was quite a shock.
Only once was there a girl who would folk dance with me.
G-getting a haircut...
This person is mine.
Don't touch him.
What is up with you? What in the world are you even worrying about?
I get so weird when I'm with you.
Do I have to tell you every single detail?
Mainly, lately the thoughts about her may have gotten too serious,
Well, that's not what I'm aiming for, though.
I mean, it's good that a beauty like you got all agitated about an otaku like him.
But that's just a misunderstanding, right?
Huh, you're talking about me?
an5I hope it goes well for her. Oooh, that sounds good!
I'm jealous of everyone... Love looks like fun.
I don't know if I'll be able to keep my cool about this...
A woman's mind is too difficult! It's a game, but I'm still shocked!
Well, I don't think this is something we should interfere with, though.
I hate when people are saying cruel things! Let's go over there, Tsutsui!
Yeah. After all that, he was really mad.
But I'm not happy! Not at all!
Something else will surely appear, so it's okay.
Oh, that reminds me. Was Kaoru okay yesterday?
Why are you crying?
Congratulations, Ito.
I think I'm about done with regular education.
Really?
Make sure you have no regrets.
What about us?
Are you ready yet?
I want us to be together forever, too.
I've been studying regularly up until now. I can get into college.
"There are a lot of things in life that are more important than credits."
If you insist.
Play again sometime! You have no rhythm, Tsutsun.
You don't have to laugh that much!
No, his test scores have actually been going down.
I'll never make fun of an anime movie again.
You're planning to go to college, aren't you?
You don't have much left of high school, and I get that you want to have fun, but...
You need to cool your head.
I'm going home.
It sure is cold...
And you know... you didn't have to throw seaweed.
Is coffee or black tea okay for you?
You'll catch a cold.
Tada iki o suru kyou to iu hi ga
Because we keep telling them our real ages.
I feel kind of bad.
As if nothing ever happened,
We're closed, so that's all I have to offer.
This is "all"? But it's like a fancy luxury meal!
That old man just talked and talked until he passed out.
That's awful.
Me, too.
Oh man...
Come back next month, next year, whenever you feel like.
an4Shinjuku
You'd better have a very good excuse.
Don't tell me...
Wh-what? Everything is perfectly normal.
I guess something suddenly came up.
It's too cold to go camping, but do you think we could all do something together again?
I-it could be anything.
I'll ask her.
Why is it so hard for me to find her?
That's enough! It's too early for this! Who are you?!
Hey! Is she home?! Did something happen?!
Th-then...
I got rid of him.
And you're sure this is what you want?
Please let me wait here until she's willing to see me.
No, I'm not going to see him again.
Well, don't!
Look.
Does this mean we'll never see each other again?
Would you mind going to the school with me, one last time?
Tsutsun, the thing is...
Huh?
Huh?
Never mind that, you have entrance exams. Do you understand that?
Th-that was going too far, Takanashi!
Tsutsui!

He said it seemed like it would be too painful for her to say goodbye to all of us.
And I bet she just couldn't bring herself to tell us that she was sick.
Thanks.
At the rate he's going, he's not gonna make it into college.
What are you doing, acting like some tragic hero?
I can't forget any of it.
I had nothing in my life...
So, Tsutsun...
One last promise.
Promise...
You all done, Tsutsui?
Some other time.
if he does have a girlfriend.
I'm 25 years old now.
Hello?
I know. That's why I called.
Thanks for watching every week!
Oh, and I'd like a refill of my oolong tea, please!
What? I-Ishino, does this mean...?
Well, with all your fighting, breaking up, getting back together again...
The cost of raising a child to adulthood plus tuition for Anzu's schooling...
I see. Good luck, Breadwinner.
What about you? Is work treating you okay?
So you actually DO have a decent prospect!
Oh, that's my phone. Sorry.
See you later, Tsutsui!
Does it really hurt that much?
Now a pair of newlyweds lives here.
And this is where you went to high school.
To be honest, it's scary.
Iroha.
and I've made a lot of really fun memories. So I'm fine.
Kareha no rhythm owari no kisetsu

Someone gave me a coffee gift set the other day. Do you want it?
A mother's life is so lonely.
Hey! That's not very nice!
Bye!
Nanmo nakatta ka no you ni As if nothing ever happened,
Hey, Chika.
Where is all of this coming from?
It's not like I'm gonna remember anything now.
There are so many better guys for you out there.
There's no one better than Tsutsun!
And that's what you want?
But...
About me...
I'm...
What is this? Why do I have it?
I know you know something. You have to!
Your belly has gotten gigantic!
I said it before, but congratulations. Ishino.
You don't get to cry before me!
Why are you catching the bouquet?!
Uh, hey, Mitsuya.
That is Igarashi, isn't it?
Igarashi's over...
I'm sorry for crashing your wedding. I know I wasn't invited.
Welcome back!
That's when Ishino kicked Tsutsui right into the river!
That was the worst.
Yup! You will always be Ishino, Ishino.
Yeah.
I hoped maybe you would fall in love with me again.
Don't go to Los Angeles.
Everybody calm down!
We've overcome every challenge so far! Let's keep trying!
And we never know what life is going to throw at us.
I made it...
Don't even worry about it.
H-how have you been, Ayado?
Dear...
Daremo shiranai koto nanda Is something nobody knows
No... It's still no good.
Are you gonna spend your whole life constantly being negative?
Tsutsun, sorry I'm late.
The extra lesson just dragged on...
But you were alone for more than an hour...
Okay.
I do! I do, but...
Up till now you came on to me in so many different ways, but still...
What do I do? I'm feeling kind of...
Go for it! At least give her a kiss!
Do you wanna just leave her waiting in vain?
Should I start with the beginning of the romance?
What do you have that I don't?
Just how much does she like me right now, I wonder?
Idiot!
Generally, you bastards are the idiots!
Of all things, I can't believe you'd leave a little child unattended!
He's here.
I know this, this atmosphere is very dj vu...
That guy sure is something. So he'd go this far.
No... Even if I defended myself, they wouldn't believe me.
Why not?
I really don't care if you're a lolicon.
That was a joke.
But...
Oh, Ishino.
Igarashi.
I've been telling you that, right? He alone is enough for me.
I can't say what it is.
Talk to me, Kaoru!
You were gloomy, but such a kind child.
And he laughs gross, too.
Not until everything blows over.
Big Brother!
This lady helped me when I fell!
Please let me go.
That guy that the officer took away the other day! That was Kaoru's big brother!
It's because you told me to yell!
Shouldn't I be the one who says I'm not doing anything?
You guys think you can just say "it's a joke" and everything's fine...?
Basically, when making an apology, there's no one that would believe me over you.
I seriously can't trust a lolicon. Let's go!
and what's more, one is my girlfriend!
It's fine. Since you're not misunderstanding anything, that's enough...
He'd probably get mad if I say that he's like Tsutsun, though.
Be aggressive and just bring it! You're unresponsive!
Nah... It's the fault of my brother who tends to be misunderstood...
Ugghh...
Thanks to binge-watching Ezomichi yesterday, I'm so sleepy...
I-I'm okay. Glasses, glasses...
Yes! I'm the person you collided with!
an5Magical Girl Ezomichi
A festival? Tonight?
Well, it's a small festival.
If my boyfriend wore something like that I'd punch him.
The Takanashi siblings really get along well. Anything you want!
What, are you angry?
Sometimes I have problem with the part of you that thinks you're so inferior to others.
Uh, yes?
But I definitely will when I get the chance.
I'm being avoided, huh?
You...
What?
It's nice that Ayado is honest.
I'm lonely...
I wonder why... It had always been normal for me to be alone...
More importantly, that worksheet...
Oh, yeah.
Alright!
Huh?
Sorry! During gym my indoor shoes disappeared, and I was looking for them, so I'm late.
No.
I don't think you'll die or anything if people hate you.
I think it's good if you can make your kindness into this sort of thing that can be properly returned.
I just bought that!
But honestly, I really was a little lonely, too.
I really don't think you were arrogant or anything.
Alright, I'll go home after all.
Yeah? I am at home...
Hey, why're you laughing?
it seemed like you still didn't believe me.
There's no way I couldn't trust you...
Huh?
She's so very soft... and smells so nice...
I-I'm going home.
S-senpai, you're such a wonderful guy! I can't believe you can do something like this!
You're so stubborn!
Hey, wait!
I randomly see Ayado sometimes and we have some shared interests so we talk ab-
Excuse me...
Let's go find Iroha right now!
I see... So that's what it is.
Huh?
B-beautiful!
H-he disappeared.
Tsutsui said he made some tomato jelly.
No...
It's an eggplant.
Yesterday, you went off somewhere crying, so...
I-I see.
Stay still for a little while.
Hairy caterpillars are my friends.
Right!
Wait! Want to come with us to Akihabara?
I don't get it!
Don't say stupid things.
Seriously. Once again I can't understand someone like you being Igarashi's boyfriend...
Wait...!
Hey, Tsutsui...
But it's fine.
Yeah.
Takanashi? Fashion... I'm sorry I didn't realize that.
No problem. If nothing happened after that, then I'm glad.
Your explanation is too simple! I'm asking you what that is and why camping!
Does this mean I have to invite Takanashi?
Hurry up, let's go!

No matter how much I think about it, I can't come up with a single good thing...
Why are you slacking off?! We're not done cleaning yet!
So you won't let me take a little break?!
an5How to Light Charcoal
I'll go pick some edible plants or something.
Y-you think so?!
Huh?
Sorry, Ishino, but you're not my type at all.
S-sorry, it just-
You seem two-faced.
Me too. This is fun.
Of course I do.
At first I didn't care what happened to that guy.
an5Everyone got so obsessed as soon as they rented a fishing pole.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Can you please stop trying to reclaim your youth here?
I'm going to get the sweets! I made them yesterday and brought them here!
I'll go make some tea!
They're in such high spirits! Don't you think it was worth it to come along?
I'm sorry that I was so loud.
But you've been thoroughly prying, haven't you?
If you don't say it on the spot every time, things will get weird again.
Hey, wanna play cards?
I was not peeking.
I'm feeling a little bit fever-ish, so is it alright if I go ahead and go to bed?
Please don't worry.
I just thought that, but I couldn't say it!
I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me, but that's not really the problem.
Oh, I thought you weren't sleeping.
Huh?
I came to love him because of that kindness.
I don't know. Something else I feared has happened...
someone who means well is worse off than someone who KNOWS that what they're doing is bad.
You idiot! You aren't even familiar with this place!
What? Did something happen?
No way!
I really don't think you're one to talk, Takanashi!
Huh? Is it that bad? Have I been that hopeless today?
That's not what I'm saying, but do you really not understand anything?
Will I keep on unknowingly hurting her like this from now on?
Yume ga same sora nagamete omou I wake from a dream and gaze at the sky

Sugoku kantan na koto nan jan ne That's not a super easy thing, right?
Hey! Do all that when we get back! It's freezing!
M-my bad.
Alright, guys, get inside, get inside...
But you sure seem worried for someone who says that.
Probably not.
That's why you being here with me right now really helps.
I-Is it?
It's from Ayado.
It looks like there's something I've gotta do, so I'll be right back!
Uh... Um...
What are you doing?
I've probably unintentionally been that way with you too, Ito.
Maybe now, I'll hurt Ayado, too.
I'm already heading straight into becoming a NEET.
I probably need that sort of thing. I'm grateful.
Okay.
That isn't true!
But you don't know that, do you? I'm a pain in the ass. I'm always pushing people.
That's a heavy burden.
Sugoku kantan na koto nan jan ne That's not a super easy thing, right?
Daijina koto nanda an1But the things I remember are very important
Really, since it's better to just get straight to it, let's go ahead and do that!
She took me from the virtual world and brought me into the world of real humans.
I-I just clean the baseballs!
I think that I'm about ten times worse of a guy than you're thinking I am, but even so...
Since I've come to know that, this time... I...
So I... U-um...
Yes...
Hey...
Ugh, me too...
Whoa, look at that!
Hey, what are you doing?
No.
Tsutsui, sorry about the other day.
I like you, Tsutsui.
Huh?
But, I've also finally liked a girl.
Thank you very much.
You're sleepy, huh?
Tsutsui.
Yeah.
Hi. Today, I'd like to talk to you a little bit.
I love you.
Wasn't I just talking about what's bothering me?
I'm your older brother. And what's up with you?
Ugh, whatever. Anzu, let's go.
Well then, let's go do that!
This is extremely unexpected.
He's always so matter-of-fact, and awkward and honest...
and I discovered so many things about myself...
Like this, maybe...
What? I mean, is it okay if I cut them?
That's the first time a boy has said something like that about me.
What is?
There's no time right now for that, class starts in five minutes
If you toss the chips in your hand at that girl, they just may be sparkling fireworks
I've gotta be imagining this.
From when I was one, I was taught to be able to use everything around me.
I see.
I'm dying...
This is fishy!
No thanks! I'm more than full now!
Here we go. She has to be desperate for one.
It acts up when I'm under stress. If I owe anyone anything, my asthma gets bad.
Ask for something, dammit!
Very well.
I'm frigging cold.
What? I don't get what she's up to.
Why am I hesitating? She saved my life.
Too bad there's not much room to sleep.
You're green! You're a green greeny!
You don't see many like me in Japan these days.
The mayor is a kappa.
What!?
Fine, whatever. Hold on a second.
If I have to.
It fits him really well.
On my journey to pick up the pieces of my love
For some reason I'm always so lonely
Even though we're never going to arrive
Are you kidding me!?
See, like this.
Fine, whatever.
Sure.
I walked away as fast as I could.
About normal temperature is fine.
A princess in clown's lipstick kisses you awake from your nap
Venus is your neighbor, so why can't you feel the love
Duh. Where else would I fish something up from?
I'm alone in my room with my girlfriend!?
Hey. You gonna eat?
What do I do...
They're all so embarrassing!
Hey!
Yeah, I guess.
But a while back I went in how I normally would and a patrol car went by...
That was a pain in the ass.
Perhaps that's why I'm crying...
Are you playing around?
I washed you because I wanted to wash you.
Who're you!? Are you from Earth!?
I think this may be my oasis.
Wow, roast whole! This is how a man cooks!
Ric!
Come on!
I made up a rule where if you can't, you have to marry a White Cornish.
I figured out how to keep walking on a line four years ago,
I haven't been back in six years.
Why don't you introduce yourself, Ric?
Pleased to meet you, everyone.
Recruit. I want to hear who you are, not what you have.
I don't have any reason to try and put these guys down...
Different kinds of jobs... So there's a priest too?
The person who says Mass.
Her? Oh, she must be a beauty!
Amen!
You're Recruit, Nino's partner, right?
Is that gun real?
I've been listening to the gossip.
Wait, that's just a candy!
Venus is my neighbor, so why did it sneak up on me
I've got to get going, before the sky falls
Closer to you.
How is it supposed to work out!?
I...
Please, make your lover happy.
Ric's final weapon comes online.
This is my finely-polished plan...
How terrible.
That's some fancy camo.
Ric taught me the magic words.
Great work. That's enough for today.
You haven't had fish in three days, have you?
So I wrote a song to cheer you on...
Rest!
Once you wake up out of that coma, you'll be full of energy! lit. 'fake death'
Ric's meal...
There's a lot of things I have to prepare at the office.
You just need to put up with it a little so we can be together from now on.
Perhaps I should pass the hug on to you?
Oh, no. Don't worry about that, Takai.
Thinking of it that way, shouldn't there be white rather than brown tiles on the walking paths?
That's my opinion of how you could improve accessibility.
No, I'm not really concerned with thinking of "liners".
Nino!
You're all too damn selfish!
We can't change it!
But--
But we'll be fine! I'm sure we can win, even competing directly!
But if Goes screws up and wins, that's exactly the problem!
I'm just gonna call my dad.
Are you really gonna be okay?
His dad seems scarier than nukes.
Where the hell are you trying to call!?
All right!
I told you, Shimazaki. Don't tell me anything more about him. Ever.
Even though we're never going to arrive
Leaving my mother's body,
I learned my own laugh which I'd never yet heard.
Beyond this planet.
Why is this happening, Ric!?
I...
Your lover is the perfect man.
It starts here. begin operation? sounds too clunky
It's been so long!
You're looking pretty cute today, Sister.
That's right, he is the worrying type. Ric as Yuno's dad. ffffff.
That quick?
I'm going back to work.
Like he's just trying to get rid of us in a roundabout way.
Welcome back!
This doesn't really seem like...
Pressure Point:
Nah...
Oh, this is your proposal for development under the bridge?
Well, Ric...
After that, some irrigation and a road I can fit a manure spreader down!
Ric, this isn't enough!
Why are you just complaining?
Isn't it enough just to be here?
I've already submitted the building plan to the contractors, anyway!
I told you that to begin with!
The path was strewn with countless booby traps, and we couldn't even get close to the river!
I already knew that!
At times like this...
Anytime. I don't care.
His dad seems scarier than nukes.
Ta-dah!
He wants to put 'more than the CEO's secretary, not quite his daddy' on them.
We laughed without a reason
It seems like it struck rather far away.
It looks like you really have daddy issues.
It's okay!
What kind of little kid is scared of those!?
I never knew you were such a tender romantic!
Wait, what?
What's wrong, Ric? Scared of heights too?
Shouldn't you go first? You're the real star, after all.
This is just like a roller coaster!
Well, even if you say so...
The minister's in a meeting
Why did this plan fall through?
I'm going out.
No thanks.
To never rely on anyone else.
As the head of the family, I have it printed on my boxers too!
You need to want something too. Otherwise it's not fair.
You can even see it from here.
See how hard my lover is working.
What on earth could he
Isn't that enough, Maria?
Wait, Ric, are you trying to run away?
I kinda have something important to do!
That's a ringtone!
Can I really do whatever I want with these?
It's a phone? Don't you have to answer it?
But like cotton soaking up water...
It will get heavier and heavier.
Would you mind coming back to
Very well!
Dad?
Thanks for picking up.
Please don't hang up!
Even I...
He gave me the pants he was wearing, too.
All right, you all ready?
Excuse me!
What?
Plus, we're starting off with the basics this time.
Me first?
Don't think about it, Ric! Go with what feels right!
Even though we're never going to arrive
And although the plot doesn't really involve them,
Would it be easier shorter?
I've been seeing him out of the corner of my eye,
What's wrong with you?
If Sister's here, nothing improper should
How the hell did you dodge that!?
Forbidden love!? That's too deep for under the bridge!
Hey, you guys. Pay attention in class!
That's right, the Metal Brothers lived in a lab before they came to the riverbank.
C'mon!
You...
Is that good enough?
That's right...
Whatever! Even if I've never been to one, I'll use my skills and my enthusiasm to make something happen!
It's a teacher's job to lead his students.
No matter what you say about the denizens of the Arakawa, they're nice guys.
Wow, all this in three days!?
That's what boys are supposed to do to men in fursuits.
Don't smile so much when you say that!
The plot's a complete ripoff, but I feel like I'm really there.
I'm amazed that they put together this serious of a 3-D
You have to sell the fantasy first!
That sounds great. My squad leader used to take me up to the front lines and...
No way!
I wanna ride!
Quit being stingy and let the kids ride, Ric.
That's it!
Yeah!
That's nice.
That sounds really happy.
I'm deliverately leaving this just so that if we do nothing in the summer bake won't be my last project
No signs of intruders.
OP
You dreamers' tickets to your meeting are for a false VIP air force
On cold nights, she comes to my room a lot.
Quit playing dumb.
Let me tell you one thing!
The fearsome human lie detector,
Well, he needed someone who could see if you were telling the truth.
I wasn't crying!
It's fine, I don't have any intention of lying.
Fine, fine, I get it.
All right, then, how many times has she slept at your place!?
I've lost track.
I really haven't done anything with Nino!
I know I hate your guts,
Oh, gosh, little old Star is sooo sorry.
Put up with it, self. I know you can't take anymore, but try to bear it somehow.
I bet you haven't!
Where are you going, Star!?
If I ask Nino on a date like this...
But then again, a date... My whole life I've been popular with girls, like someone out of a comic,
Going out is high-risk, no-return...
It's like a deal with the devil!
This is Kou!
Our analysis indicates the handwriting on this one is that of Miss Ohba from class 2.
I wonder if that one will make it to the sea?
Can't you see, Nino?
These roses, and my designer suit. They're all to get your attention.
How unexpected!
Sounds unlucky.
Maybe I should leave running Japan to you, Ichinomiya.
Nino, would you like to join in?
You're ditching me because you think I'm an idiot!?
Yeah!
The mayor is a kappa. It's as plain a fact as that I'm a Venusian.
I was planning to have you wear this dress on our date. Why don't you try it on?
It's been twenty minutes. Does it really take that long to put on a dress?
Well, it is pretty complicated. It must be hard to put on alone.
We'll always be looking for an answer
Star here singing for you! Next time, 4 Bridge!
You're there when I get up, there at lunch, there when it's time for bed
The view along the banks of the Arakawa changes as you draw closer to the sea.
Right now I've got to hurry, I meet you in five minutes
Do you always just do nothing but walk like this on dates?
What are you talking about, Nino?
Oh, really?
is a sense of distance!
We can do this, Recruit.
Let's go!
Oh no, Ric! There's nothing to hide behind!
Come on, Nino! It's not over yet!
That's right!
Dates seem pretty exhausting.
The dress I gave you before must have been pretty tough to put on alone.
Well...
It's okay!
bord5Secret technique! Judas's Betrayal!
I wanted to meet Sister!
Stella...
One of you take care of her.
Wait, your siblings...
She doesn't have a relative in the world, does she!?
Of course!
I've never played with a girl, but I'll do whatever.
Really?
Mistake!
I had a one-on-one match with him!
The fish's done. You gonna have any?
Hi! Nice weather today, isn't it?
There's no way she'd call me her little brother.
Did something happen?
No, nothing.
Heah, I guess. I mean, this is a farm.
What the hell is the government doing!?
I don't want to meet anyone else.
Even though we're never going to arrive
Standing under the bridge, borne on the waves
Sorry.
I'm so worried. yuuuuuuuu.
I was trained not to in order to endure interrogation.
But when I receive a harsh mental shock,
Sister said I could get veggies over here.
They're clearly just broken!
Behold...
P-ko?
Nino!
It's been so long.
Isn't that going a bit too far?
P-ko...
Really?
Everything about them...
I guess paprika's...
You don't normally see tomatoes this big!
A sunny, breezy afternoon.
Isn't it nice, Stella?
Yeah.
Are you sure that's okay!?
Wouldn't it be sad leaving her the only one without a name!?
We could even throw in Red Hare.
Of course!
All right, let's--
The river will run wild tonight...
But Nino and I are lovers.
Come on, Sister, you mustn't tease him like that.
He's not moving.
What's that picturesque scene?
That guy over there is a stylist.
Lately, you've had nice stiff shoulders.
Sorry, Ric. I was focusing on my food.
And even he has a job!?
Leeches?
Father? What's wrong, father?
Aww, I just thought of a good melody this morning.
Anyway, you're in my way. Will you move?
She absolutely won't be coming today.
It should be obvious which is more charming!
So, you say men who play music are popular with the ladies.
For some reason I'm always so lonely
First, we are born in the same galaxy.
A princess in clown's lipstick kisses you awake from your nap
Venus, she's always so lonely, don't look away
Jesus, if you're across from me, please listen
Wow, Ric plays the violin?
This isn't even a fair fight.
I love you!
What!?
Look at that, Ric!
Wrong.
He's completely snapped!?
Yeah, that's it!
Success in business goes to those able to discern the best-selling product for the market.
We can't! We can't swim!
If we let go, we'll drown!
Nino's unexpectedly helpful.
All right, this is...
In this world, there are things you have to explain with words!
So, Nino, when are you going to teach them the flutter kick and when to breathe?
You two.
Give me your hands.
Humans being able to swim is a lie!
I told you, if we take off our masks we have superpowers!
Anyway, if you don't want to take the masks off no matter what...
You can use them as kickboards.
Good job.
You guys...
I'm looking forward to it!
How about you show me a cat-shaped robot for that one?
Even though I'm a youkai, when it happens it happens.
Anyway, why don't you take some medicine before it gets worse?
Maybe you want to give it a try?
Why's he sneezing like this?
And I make sure not to get chilly!
Your lymphocytes fight the virus. If they can't get hot, they can't fight.
You...
It's true that there's no point in telling them anything now...
A man among men, an elite among elites!
A Venusian?
Mayor!
The Brothers are nice and pliable, I'll beat some sense into them first.
Fireballs are plasma!
Common sense can seize up just like that.
All my expenses, from school tuition to apartment rent,
were paid by me, without relying on my parents.
One must not be indebted to others.
a situation like this.
Children these days are really quite eccentric.
They hung them up there and split.
My ass will show, but Ill reach them.
Its just fine! Leave me alone.
I cant do this alone.
Damn it.
Having saved my life means that,
Home?
I catch them from the river.
Whats wrong? Your voice got
Asthma?
Oh. I do have a desire.
fall in love with me?
a debt is a debt.
I will fall in love with this girl
Well, theres something we need to decide on first.
Understood.
This is the villa.
So, shall we go?
Not a chance.
Im of fine birth. Im intelligent, too.
You could say Im an elite. lit: the chosen few
Village Chief?
No matter how I fix it up, Im a kappa.
Next time, if you see my friends,
Youve been deceived!
Youre just a gourd covered up with human skin.
What are you saying?
Just sit there.
Crap! The cloths stuck in there.
Thats a good name.
Just one more, all right?
Yeah. You are...
Ill take Recruit, please.
Including the one you lent me, there should be two.
Whats the matter with you? Asthma again?
Completely deceived!
Oh. When will you be able to use it again?
I should probably go home to gather a few things.
Yeah, sure.
I want to see it.
Later, then.
I quickly walked away from there.
That heat would kill me!
even if there is no end in sight
to actually be living under a bridge like this
Its grilled, so just eat up.
I want to feed my lover when hes hungry, at least.
Come to think of it, Id almost forgotten that shes my lover.
Im all alone with her in my room!
I-I have to say something.
Well
What did you watch on TV yesterday?
Is it possible to have normal daily conversations with Nino-san?
From what I remember, Nino-san is
What should I do?
Hey.
Ve
The public bath is far away, too.
The Village Chief taught me that.
Normally, at times like this, a girl would react
But since she didnt react that way, doesnt that mean its okay?
I dont think Nino-san is the type whod be bothered by it.
All right. Shall I get out?
We havent even held hands yet!
Really? Im glad.
Yeah. But once is enough, though.
Thats what Id like to say,
When I was very young, my father once washed my hair.
Lets get along.
Feels like this could be my oasis.
Whats wrong?
I should be asking you.
Look, Rec.
Thats more like a brother than a sister!
Fine.
Listen up, Nino-san.
His scars have nothing to do with this, right?
Theyre getting baited!
Im not being jealous here.
To sum it up, this is what they say:
The others will get used to it.
If there was a creator,
Even though Ive been told to go in there and wait
H-Hoshi!
Nino was leavin your house early in the morning the day before yesterday!
What is this about?
I-I didnt cry!
Im not going to lie anyway.
Its true.
Ive never counted.
N-No way
If it was me, each and every time,
No, its not.
She goes home as soon as she wakes up.
This is rare. Has he reflected on his errors?
a homo?
That means I dont have to take it back That Recs a chicken.
I still stand a chance then, right?
Hey, where are you going, Hoshi?!
In place of the useless guy who never takes her out,
Such an unrealistic number?
Hoshi-kun, thanks for your advice.
Since you put it that way, Ill show you
perfect!
I look great no matter what I wear.
Could a relationship be high risk, no return?!
And the 3,000 chocolates I receive
Returning them all to the rightful owners was a nearly impossible task.
Recovery result: that chocolate has been returned to Ooba-san from Class 2.
What were those who didnt leave their names with the chocolates trying to do?
If its not a one-shot performance, what was it? ippatsu-one shot, round
Yes. Today, Ive come to invite you on a date.
No, please wait.
If Ichinomiya-kun hadnt saved me from that situation back then
Its not a picture story.
Yes, thats right.
I would really love to go,
Whats that?
Hold it.
Ill accompany you.
I think so too.
You think so?
Nah, I cant. Thats sacred to me.
Ill go with a war joke.
Hoshi will sing!
Tired-looking secretaries eating lunch.
A young couple walking on the riverbank.
And Nino-san, move a little to the right.
Rec, whats next?
It celebrates the completion of the sense of distance.
Im so glad.
Hey, Rec.
The front!
Oh, sorry.
Thats right.
Id be lying if I said I didnt want to pursue those matters,
Its dangerous.
For example,
Sachiels stance!
England?
Yes! Well do it!
Im going fishing after this,
Hm? What is it?
but Ill join her in anything.
Uh, well, I
Here I go.
Rec, what are you doing?
She must be a nice girl after all.
Rec.
Come on, lets go, both of you!
Hello there. How are you today?
Calm down, Rec.
Sister!
Suffocating.
Sorry.
Oh my!
bord0blur0.6Get the hell out of my way, even my shadow's too good for you.
bord0blur0.6If you kill a single ant, what could you ever do to atone for your sins?
Itd be great if you could just vanish from my field of vision.
Im counting on you.
Sorry, but can you go back first?
First cake ingredients and now vegetable provisions, huh?
That cant be true!
No!
I couldnt do that even if I wanted to!
Dont address me so familiarly, you crook!
This girl
Such a diseased eggplant-looking human?
Youre embarrassing me
Yeah, it tastes great!
This is why I dont like the residents under the bridge.
Id only learn of the reason
Is that okay?
Having only one persons name remain unchanged
You sure came up with some pretty brawny names
but I want to learn the different things here!
Come on, Rec. Eat all you want.
Its my job to fish.
Oh my, you shouldnt bully Rec-kun like that, Sister.
Dont worry about a thing.
wonderful.
As the future president of the greatest enterprise in the world,
I dont understand what youre trying to say.
Hey, Rec, are you caving in after seeing a whole new aspect of me?
an8Ive gotten hold of some outstanding stock.
I was engrossed in eating.
You went and said it, you bastard!
Father.
Father? Father!
Freeloader, freeloader, freeloader!
Why did I have a dream like that?
Youre pretty lively considering its so early, Hoshi.
Could you possibly be talking about Nino?
You dont even have the guts to pick a fight, huh?
Really, Nino, what do you see in such a
6 Bridge!
and lead lives that coincide.
You or me?
Today, on this stage, we shall make that abundantly clear.
Just what I wanted.
Hes got a ribbon on his neck
Or rather, he seems to give the impression of a performer.
Its a challenge to see who entertains Nino the most.
You have already lost.
thoughtsAnd of course, this is Ninos favorite song, too!
Im not going to overlook it!
Was that a scream?
The match is mine.
wouldnt it be better if I did that job instead?
That song!
Ni-Nino-san
No, nothing in particular.
Or rather
In any case, let go of her!
an8All right, come on, lets try it again.
The feelings of a fish.
Give me your hands.
You said people float! You lied!
Besides, we knew from the very start that we could swim if we removed our masks!
Youve taught me many things, too.
Can we manage that too if we use some tool?
Those guys are really running the bathhouse.
Who would bathe in an oil drum twice?
Rec encountered a kappa in the bath.
Even demons catch cold sometimes.
Well, you dont have to cover it up.
Theres a secret omnipotent medication passed down in the Kappa family, after all.
I think its the smell of polypropylene.
Wow. Rec-san always does everything with all his might.
Oh, so I sleep this way
Its fine to be shocked by the depth of my knowledge,
Since youre so knowledgeable, be a teacher instead of a freeloader!
They really did recover after this.
Hoshi with common sense.
And he is Recruit!
I think Ill fight with Dracula from now on.
Sorry. Ive only seen Episode I of Star Wars.
Chiefs one-shot performance!
As high as he can imagine.
Even if one doesn't know why,
You dreamers' tickets to your meeting are for a false VIP air force
Here comes his attack, pretending he didn't hear my 'bye-bye'
Venus, she's always so lonely, don't look away
Come on, Nino, of course I did.
Nino, do you know?
You already knew ordinary measures weren't enough for under the bridge.
Mayor? Star?
I didn't think I'd be here long, but...
ric shows off his e7 face
Student-fucker!
And perfect attendance, too...
Let's study science!
You can't be that casual about it!
It's okay. Don't let it get to you.
Hey, Ric!
Wow, it really does! It's so exciting!
Why do you have to do that!?
Fine, fine, I get it.
A little teaching is good enough.
When did you get here, anyway!?
Why don't you ask Sister?
But this year, I think I'm going to take classes and get my driver's license!
Once I have my license, I'll be able to take a car and go looking for seedlings far away.
Sorry, I forgot you were a youkai.
How about a makeover? they're just ueggroeugbhreuocrbhuoe every fucking shaft thing i've ever hated dealing with
Didn't your haircut used to be more wild?
Really? Guess I'll do that.
He's turned into some icky-looking creature...
What do I do?
That day, on the playground
Just to start with, his face!
I guess he really doesn't have any then.
I guess he has less than anyone.
After all, that's his real way of living!
Never mind.
No, it's Lord Arakawa Junior.
Right... Ive relinquished the stigma of being a freeloader that Hoshi had put on me,
Nino-chan, do you know that?
Stella-chan taught us that before.
Well, theyre not interested, so theyve no interest in learning.
Uh... I guess.
You even said youd attend them all.
Okay, you two.
Do you know what a magnet is?
Nope. Whats that?
W...
Its not that hard
Wow, so cool!
I cant?!
The class is progressing smoothly.
Dont worry... I mustnt mind it.
Thats the parachute you mount on the rocket.
Thats so
You fellas dont have any respect, eh?
you have to pay protection money first. Thats common sense.
Hey, which one was bigger, hundred million or trillion?
close your damn school already!
What is it?
Amateurs shouldnt be playing with stuff like this.
Anyway, when did you get here?
Yeah. Didnt I tell you?
She seems to be enjoying herself.
Yes, I love school!
Im so sorry!
You expect me to take them all?
Are you gonna be okay alone?
so clumsy?
Sorry.
he would reflexively shoot at it!
If youre out there driving a car, youll kill a person every hundred meters!
I hope you werent arguing.
No, Im sorry. I forgot you were a demon.
How about an image change?
Image change?
Theyre gonna be surprised, then.
Huh?
Theres nothing to fall in love with from a guy in that damned suit!
No! I love his insides, too!
Regardless of that, hes living his life as he wants
The real you... hidden inside?
What is common sense?
Short story.
Mixed martial arts.
A bride?
No, thats not what I meant.
i1It was the only time Father ever came to Parents' Day.
i1It was an essay on my goals for the future.
i1Thinking about it now,
He's late.
We can't wait any longer. Let's go take a look outside.
born to be on top
an8I already told you once, do it right!
My deepest apologies.
i1Dammit, stop making things so difficult!
i1Crap... he's starting to get suspicious.
i1I still have Whitey!
I mean it, stay away!
So are we all finished here?
If so, let's head elsewhere and talk about the main office.
Looks like fun!
How can you say that?!
Girlfriend?
i1an8Even the Arakawa residents were freaked out.
Ah, a new nickname to follow Moochyman, huh?
Sweet, no cavities.
So obviously I could never
i1Just as I suspected.
How unusual!
i1And with that, you can totally refute their entire relationship.
What's in a kiss?
i1During that time, my wife divorced me.
From now on, you can live only for yourself.
please stand by his side for as long as possible.
I'm... a starfish!
What if it got her pregnant?!
You were?
But I cannot allow him to disgrace the Ichinomiya family name!
It's finally finished!
fscx92Perfect for burning coal to make white powder anytime!
Um, I've been wondering...
Nice, huh?
i1If she finds out Sister is in love with Maria,
Bingo.
Better to lose all hope now than later on down the line!
Eh?
You have no idea how painful unrequited love can be.
Big Sis! Yes!
Hurry up and eat, while it's still hot.
i1The first supper of the brokenhearted tag team.
Her head!
Head!
My enemy?
i1Perfect... she's sure to understand!
Was that another war story? You're not just living out some fantasy, are you?
That's an amazing thing, Stella.
Every girl in the world...
i1I just sang whatever he told me to.
Just a couple questions.
Dirt!
i1She told me Venusians are masters at distinguishing celestial bodies.
Huh? Oh, yeah, for sure. But that's all in the happy past, now.
Sister, how do you say this?
-te-
And this one?!
i1To wish...
I've cleared the surrounding brush.
Oh... so the fire won't spread, right?
Jeez. Sister, you shouldn't coddle him like that!
Your cookies are the best.
Yes, well... if you tried to do the same thing, I'd turn you into swiss cheese.
Actually, I'm in the Chief's debt.
i1We put the fire out by handing off a bucket filled with water.
Right. Grown men. Preferably ones who aren't wearing potentially flammable masks.
Go, my hero!
We're all working hard here!
How's it go? Don't stop, don't drop, don't roll?
I knew we shouldn't have let Kappa-man handle it to begin wi
Good job, Chief!
Look at his idiotic face.
We're surveying the land.
How can you be so calm? Don't you see what's happening here?!
There's a very real possibility we won't be able to stay down here once the construction starts!
If the police get involved, I highly doubt they'll let us off with a warning.
Yes, really!
I've created a Kappa Barrier to protect us.
i1Just yesterday I learned about the plan to develop the Arakawa riverside.
More importantly, why is this happening all of a sudden?
i1"The one where you have to stay on the line until you get home?"
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are we gonna do?!
Excuse me! I'm from the Ministry of Land.
What the hell?
government swine.
Well, to be honest, I'm here with an eviction notice for
He might get on your nerves,
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
i1He's like a different person.
Yes. The contract hasn't actually been finalized yet,
The Ad Lib Anthem!
I'm tired of being kicked out or getting separated.
I want to stay here
I'm way more reliable than some tenderfoot trying to turn tail and run.
Anything's possible.
Rec, you're so cool!
i1A company headed by Rec himself.
You in disguise, too?
Magic phrase?
Thanks... Supervisor?
You'd be perfect if we were at a theme park.
Man, I'm glad someone gets it.
Huh? Rec, you bastard!
Hey, Hoshi...
Secret pressure point...
But you know, I don't think this is even Rec.
Oh, you're right. Then who is he?
He will wake up, right?
Come back, already.
I didn't believe it could be done at first, a plan to challenge the Ichinomiya Group.
i1victory is ours!
i1If he were a man who could be negotiated with,
i1Master Ko... I know this is well beyond crossing the line, but...
Can't we eliminate this man from our reports somehow?
i1A place where our beloved resides.
You look well.
Anyway, I'm glad to see everything's just how I left it.
With my perfect planning,
I'll be assuming control of this area's development rights!
Yup. And I'll be bidding for construction rights, as well.
Don't try to come off like you're thinking of everyone.
You have to do better than this, or they'll come for us!
Why does it matter?
And a satellite would be nice!
So your company isn't doing the construction?
I figured it was just a good-natured competition with consent from both of you.
Mr. President...
i1We actually sent a few guys down there yesterday to check out the area.
i1They all got caught in bizarre booby traps before they could even reach the water.
What's wrong, Rec? You don't look well.
Ugh! And where's the Chief when we need him?!
i1"Maybe you're not scared since he's your father, but..."
Any time. When to call isn't an issue.
You better not be thinking about leaving again.
Who the hell did you just call?!
You made such a big deal out of it.
That sounds like a sad excuse from a weak man to me.
Hah! As if.
You look great!
It's always better to have more stars, right?
Is that really something to be proud of?
Well I'd jump from the metropolitan office!
Please let us stay here forever!
Please let us stay here forever!
i1Their wish has come true.
Explain yourself. My company just won the development rights today!
What?! Where's the Minister?
Who do you think funds all your little pet proj
i1How could I have imagined a gang of eccentric youths would sweep in and steal my pants?
i1However, I'm far better than this!
I decline.
i1I have no name to give her.
Of course.
Well, the real stars will start coming out pretty soon.
and apologize to the cookies for your impudence.
i1No one here, not even Ko, has realized they're perfectly safe?
Can I really keep them?
i1F-Father?
i1Oh, don't hang up! No, I mean
i1I'm going to stand by Nino forever!
Oh, Rec! Hey, I don't know
You already did.
Okay, is everyone ready? It's time for impression training!
Yup. Like imitating familiar animals and stuff.
Oh, well in that case...
Relax, Rec. Relax!
Don't think about it, Rec.
Wait, was that all just sleep talk?!
i1First, there are the regulars.
i1but who wander in and out of each scene.
i1They also have their own lives.
i1And there's one thing I've been really curious about.
That's one stubborn case of bed head.
Don't tell me you being here is just a coincidence!
Maybe I should go have my hair treated, too.
he's lurking!
No, perhaps you use Samurai Blue?
It wouldn't be that bad. Indeed, you might look quite fetching!
i1What? Why are you acting so weird?!
If I just layered it here...
Yes!
i1At least he's not too forceful or anything.
My shoulder huuuurts!
Well?
Sorry.
So then, Sister... what kind of cut would you
Cram it!
But we're not leaving! You'll hafta kill us first!
There's nothing I can't do!
What is it? Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.
Not bad, Rec.
i1The people down here are pretty decent folks, after all.
Welcome, friends.
In here, there are only dreams, walnuts,
Whoa, now that's an admirable creation.
Me? On a carousel?
It's kind of embarrassing, but... One quick ride can't hurt!
And that look on your face
They're the cast members?
This is so cool!
Hey, you there.
It's not like we went to a lot of fairs when we were little.
Ahh, sounds nice.
My commanding officer would often take me to the front lines.
Not true, Rec! It doesn't even go all that fast.
It'll be fine this time.
Okay!
Welcome.
I'm surprised they're having so much fun.
Mine's blue!
Ah, sure!
i1The memory of today...
It wouldn't be wrong to say I'm a real winner.
I'm attending one of Japan's most prestigious universities,
My independent lifestyle can be attributed to my family motto:
- kawa
Isoi de nai no ima daiji anata ni deau gofun mae I'm in no real hurry, this is important. It's 5 minutes before we meet.
Kiraija naino iyana dake yosoku dekinai kono kimochi I don't really hate you, I just don't like you. I'm not really sure how I feel about you now.
Jesus hikikaesenai no hayaku kizuite Jesus, no I can't go back now. Hurry up, please notice me.
Un-
Luckily, there are few passersby here at this time of day.
No. I'm actually more sensitive to heat.
Perfect defense!
Never be indebted to anyone!
Good luck.
"Never be indebted to anyone!" x2
"Never be indebted to anyone!" x7
How can I repay my debt?
And it must feel really dangerous for a lonely female resident like yourself.
You think so?
If she's bonkers, she's probably serious about the house.
You need to chill out.
Huh?
Got it.
Just... please don't freeze to death in my house.
It sounds like you're talking about marriage!
I'll probably forget all about you.
Cool.
I'll just think of it as just one more temporary relocation.
Great, let's go.
So... what kind of guy is the Chief?
Does that stuff matter to you?
Also, I have a nice body and an attractive face.
Basically, you're like the best person ever.
Getting his attention.
Ah, Chief!
No matter what kind of being you are, being shunned
I can see your skin, right there.
And calling attention to someone's physical shortcomings
The top part is totally vacuum-sealed!
Can you absolutely deny it?
Damn, you're annoying. And gross.
How do I fix this?
Are we done here? I'd like to lie down for a while.
Let me think. You're...
But it sounds like he's just making fun of me!
Chapter 8: "A Place of Rest"
Who're you, again?
It's not nice to interrupt people when they're talking.
Well, I've got a ton of newspaper.
I think I overestimated the average sub-bridge living conditions.
I'm a fool. I fell for it so easily.

That was

Well, I have to admit. I'm relieved.

Jesus omukaisan nano kiite yabai no Jesus, he's right across the street. This could be a problem.
neoki no kikku wa aisatsu gawari ni namaashi itsumo kizudarake A careless kick to wake you up, my defenseless legs are all scratched up
Have I... made a terribly idiotic mistake?
Not to mention the fact that I'm now residing under a bridge.
Is that the only way to get dinner down here?
I'm all alone in my room with my girlfriend!
What do I do?
But when I see her in a normal environment like this,
I'm just now realizing how cute she really is.
Are you okay?
I have to say something. Um...
Where do you get your hair done? Did you catch the news last night?
Cats?
Okay.
Her name.
Anyway! Is it...
Is it springtime on Venus right now?
My scalp is really itchy. But I do live under a bridge now.
The Chief told me to say it.
And Nino doesn't seem like the kind of person who would mind, anyway.
The fact that she wouldn't mind is all the more reason not to look, right?
and it just turned into a giant mess.
It's certainly an interesting learning style.
I wasn't sad that I was suddenly forced to face reality.
I demand to know who you are! And if you're from Earth!
Whoa. Do all those people... live around here?
Oh, Rec!
Heh. Yeah, that's me.
It's because I only walk on white lines.
Why don't you introduce yourself? You can manage that, right Rec?
You still haven't accepted your new name, have you?
Might I still find emotional respite here under the bridge?
Fall in!
Good.
Anyone who has sinned... raise your hand!
That only lasted five seconds!
I guess I never learn.
Hey.
You there.
"I wanna beat the crap out of Recruit."
Their eyes told me everything.
Right...
"Just grin and bear it, and you'll be..."

When my girlfriend Nino is asleep,
Here again?
Nino, that's my line.
week
You don't know what you're-
Now, come on out!
Do you think so?
I really wanted to play along and let him think whatever he wants.
Sister, am I lying?
Intelligent and charming. Perfect bone structure! Limitless earning power!
Every Valentine's Day has been nothing but trouble.
All those hundreds of chocolates.
But I spent all last night reviewing some pertinent materials.
That was... unexpected.
No, please wait!
Nino and me! My first-date proposal
First, we'll go for a spin in my supercar
It's not the cherry blossom!
What do you think, Nino?
No, you see-
I thought we were finally starting to have some normal conversations.
Why don't you tell me where you'd like to go?
Rec...
It seemed to take great courage for her to leave the area.
Oh, I almost forgot. Nino-
If you don't mind, could you try it on?
I've been waiting 20 minutes now.
nagareru uzu ni atte Coasting through this swirling life
A good idea, indeed.
But the Chief's is definitely the best one ever!
That's my lucky day!
Thinking back on it now,
I didn't even want to talk about my dreams.
I showed my father a little resistance.
I don't hate you, I just don't like you, I don't know what I'm feeling
Kou.
When I spotted you from the bridge yesterday, I had wondered what exactly you were doing,
Why couldn't you have told us what was occuring sooner?
How do you plan on getting them to buy that?
It doesn't matter! I just can't let them find out the real reason I'm here.
It cost around three million yen!
Anyway, maybe if you showed me that there really was no one lower than you?
Anyway, these are your staff?
Oh, what a nice suit!
Maria!
That's enough from you!
Who's this last person?
But why, Ko?
He seems a fine humble man.
I can't sweep anything else under the rug!
Let us join in!
And who's the young lady?
This is Nino, Nino, uhh, Ms. Niino!
Nope.
Ni
Um, that's nice and everything, but for now...
Matching monogrammed teacups.
No need to thank me.
I didn't think they were so close that they could live together.
this is more "playing house" than "love". the "mamagoto" cognate here so makes me want to pull in Char's line about Lalah..
And then Ms. Niino is practically a grade schooler.
There's something wrong here, Ko!
Great job, Baldy. I see where you're going with this.
How do kisses work, anyway?
As I read his emailed instructions which poured in without a break,
to me he became...
That's...
Star. Cheer u
Yeah.
You too.
In order to compose myself,
Between the eyes?
but that keeps him on the straight and narrow.
I feel like I can fly!
That's all for the presentation.
I see. I've heard he's a very useful man.
Look at this.
Papa is a father too.
That day, on the playground
You know, I've been wondering for a while. Where does Whitey live?in the suburbs, duh.
Right by it, see?
I knew it!
WARNING: Absolutely no swimming! As Nino requested, we're headed to the mouth of the Arakawa River.
I had no idea!
We're so far away, but your love is right next to my heart!
I get it now!
We're right back where we started, aren't we?
There's one thing every date has to have.
In the front!
Behold! The princess ride!
Huh?
Me too. I can't feel my arms.
Maybe I'll ask her what I couldn't earlier.
But you didn't seem to have any problem with it.
It didn't reach the sea.
Rec, what are you doing? Be carefu-!
All my splashing set the boat free.
Are you in any pain?
She can speak Japanese!
I'd better go call the orphanage.
What to do? Mm, what to do?
Maybe I can trick her into wanting to play by herself.
What? What is it?
Huh? You don't have any siblings?
I forgot it was Sister who raised her!
Me and my big brother were just playing fight club.
But maybe I did just go easy on her.
Stella...
Oh, then I guess I'd better do my best.
So do we have to leave the river to get the ingredients?
Well... yeah.
Anohi yuugure In the dusk of that day

I feel as if my entire existence was just utterly rebuked.
Scary...  But I'm sure even Sister himself would lose it if someone insulted him like that!
But I'm sure even Sister himself would lose it if someone insulted him like that!
I apologize.
You're hideous.
Sorry.

What about the errand? We didn't just come here for eggs and milk, did we?
You...
Broken?
Are you okay?
Sorry 'bout that! I was trying to dodge a stray cat and my delivery fell off the tray!
Chapter 35: "How About Paprika?"
You're horrible.
Nino, you'll never believe it. This girl-
All of them? So then this garden really is hers.
It's not like they wanted to grow up to be bitter!
You're right!
I've never seen such huge tomatoes!
Now I understand.
What the hell's with that doll?
Good for you, Stella!
She's the only one without a new name. She's gonna feel left out!
Why would you even use the names of attack helicopters to begin with?
so still I have a lot to learn.
I just hope I can become another member of the family under the bridge.
Okay Rec, eat as much as you want.
Um, well... actually, I prefer the little fish you normally catch.
Really, these are great!
But Nino is my lover, so I'm obliged to accept her acts of kindness.
He's not moving.
I have studied social etiquette since the day I was born.
Never be indebted to anyone I have studied social etiquette since the day I was born.
I have already established multiple Fortune Global 500 companies.
Yeah. Don't sweat it, Rec. I'm doing this because I want to.
Be thankful you have such a generous girlfriend.
I don't know what you mean.
I'm Hoshi!
Oopsie.
Oh, sorry Rec. I was just so focused on my riceball-
Well, I...
Father?
Huh? Oh, Rec! You're up early.
Here you go. I figured I'd hand-deliver your invitation.
And that's why I am forever perfect!
Honestly... you are the most unlikeable person in the world.

Wow, I didn't know Rec could play the violin.
I love that one-length style. My throne!
All right, Maestro Rec. Go ahead!
You're too kind.
People always close their eyes like that when they want to enjoy truly beautiful music!
CUUUUUUUTE!!!
Victory... is mine!
Hey, so... I know you said you were in charge of music down here.
you'd just be some jobless jerk without anyone to even mooch off of.
This should shut him up for now.
Snap?
Nino! Uh, nothing. I mean-
That aside... you two.
- Okay, I'll show you one more time. - Nino is surprisingly good with kids.
Why?!
Relax your legs. See how you float?
I didn't hear anything crazy at all.
Nice work.
You guys...
This is really exciting!
Moochymaaan!
Wear what? All I'm wearing is my birthday suit, as usual.
I may be a yokai, but even I get sick once in a while.
Like I said-
Special? No, it's fine, really. You can just say it.
A secret recipe?
Even disease itself is no match for me.
Didn't Nino say the same thing?
But wait...
A more sensible Hoshi...
I suppose I should battle Dracula and whatnot from now on.
What you said earlier... I think I'm gonna become a teacher.
Woo! I can't wait!
Fireballs are just plasma! I'll work on the more impressionable twins first.
Common sense isn't so common, after all.

The bridge is kind of like the roof.
I'm just glad you found yourself a job.
and from now on I'll be a respectable teacher down here.
I know like five "standard ways!"
I'll just start with the little things, and eventually they'll all pile up.
Yup!
As if there's anything you humans could teach me...
Nino, are you in his class?
I wonder if Hoshi will start coming, just to be around Nino.
Every day, huh?
Class.
Hey, get back here!
That was a real soul-touching shout, huh?
Well, that's-
Apparently, Hoshi titled his new song, "Die, You Student-Touching Scholastic Deviant."
"It's hard to concentrate on stuff they're not interested in."
One... two...
Don't worry. It's not all that hard, anyw-
By the time those awful lab rats detect your esper waves, it'll be too late!
When I was little, my favorite experiment was building a rocket out of a plastic water bottle.
Nino is no more odd than usual, and the twins are behaving well today.
Oh, that's a parachute. It goes on the rocket.
This is so exci-
Stella!
Hand over 100 billion yen!
Only
Secret techn-
I'm truly sorry.
- Just one could take out a tank, no problem.
- You bloodthirsty, bogus child of God in disguise! - Just one could take out a tank, no problem.
Whoa, that's so cool!
Ah, that's what this is.
Sister...
I'm sorryyy!
You're the only one left!
Chapter 59: "Transformation" There will definitely be blood!
Chapter 59: "Transformation"
None!
No, it's my fault. I forgot you're a yokai.
It's always good to try something new, though.
Give it a try? What, like wear a wi-
His hair just looked too soft.
Yeah, that suit is definitely impressive.
- So when you say they'll all fall for him "too,"
itsumo nazeka sabishiku naru

Hashi no shita ni tatte He's accepted his true way of life.
Huh?
That's... King Arakawa!
What I like is-!
I talked back to him for the first time. And the last.
Daitan aitsu no kougeki baibai kizuitenai furi Bang bang, here comes the attack now, bye bye, act like you don't see now
daitan aitsu no kougeki masa ni ikijigoku Boom boom, here comes the shock now, this all feels like a lovely nightmare
They are employees from Rec's top company.
Yup. And amazingly, you all ended up looking normal.
Sort of.
Keep those nice designer suits I bought for you, and we'll call it even.
Of course I did! Your outfits cost like 3 million yen all together!
I mean, think about it. I have to pretend to be beneath you.
I mean, think about it. I have to pretend to be beneath you.
But what amazes me even more
Chapter 63: "Employees Under the Bridge"
Now then...
Are these your new staff members?
Maria!
Mirror?
Wow.
Dammit, stop making things so difficult!
Are you serious?
Ah, I feel like I'm right back in my old office.
Boy, isn't he just adorable?
Ah, so that explains the costume-
- I'm so jealooouuus!
Ah, that smells nice. Is it Earl Gray today?
They're probably fudge buddies by now.
Ah, a new nickname to follow Moochyman, huh?
Cavity Diary
Cavity Diary Master Ko, this is meant to be kept within the family circle.
What? Am I wrong?
I may have slightly overreacted earlier, but now it's obvious-
Master Ko, you can't possibly call this a "relationship."
And with that, you can totally refute their entire relationship.
But aren't you lovers?
Nino, not now!
I also heard he didn't look too happy.
I put him under 24-hour surveillance for a full week before we actually met.
Bluebirrrrrd!
That's all for today. Any questions?
I wanna try cooking one for Sister, but...
Yeah, I bet you're right! Then let's get to grilling!
kiraija naino iyana dake yosoku dekinai kono kimochi I don't hate you, I just don't like you. I just don't know how I feel about you.
Rec, you're my taste-tester!
This is it. I'll destroy her.
Hurry up and eat, while it's still hot.
Ahh, and so then you came here to warn-
So you knew?
Sister, you have to put a stop to this!
She'd kill me a hundred times over.
I've developed a secret technique just for you.
Lemme go!
I've discovered your secret!
Side View  Main Body Ornament Real Mouth
That "mask" of yours is really your body!
Hi, there! Would you like to be my friend?
You deceived the unsuspecting young man with your fanciful appearance.
You flesh-eating starfish!
I don't wanna hear about your repressed feminine side!
I don't have time for your delusions.
My story is totally non-fiction!
He just straight-up admitted it. Was I too harsh?
Acting as if I'd had anything to do with their creation...
You're wasting your time sitting there listening to my shitty music.
That girl turned out to be my goddess, ruler of my desti-
I'm just getting to the best part! Chill the hell out, would ya?
Lots of rock stars have weird habits they don't like to talk about.
Well, anyway...
The girl sitting there was Nino.
I wanted to be alone, so I just ignored her at first.
This stuff's a giant bag of crap compared to the music I play up there!
hashi no shita ni tatte Standing here under the bridge
So I just shoved her in along with the bed.
It retains the contours of our hands and fingers.
Daitan aitsu no kougeki baibai kizuitenai furi Bang bang, here comes the attack now, bye bye, act like you don't see now
- a fire drill.
I've cleared the surrounding brush.
Thanks, Sister.
Isn't that a little extreme?!
Ahh, I can feel myself drying out.
Just let me know if you need anything.
Why is Sister always so eager to please the Chief? I doubt Sister's intimidated by him.
The highlight of every fire drill, of course. The bucket relay!
Right. Grown men. Preferably ones who aren't wearing potentially flammable masks.
The Chief is such a brave soul!
Don't push  Don't run  Don't shout
Chief!
They simply aren't things a man of your caliber has earned.
Gotta say, this seems like overkill.
That's not very helpful!
Oh yeah. No matter what they say, my response should be:
Ahh, this sucks! I'll be in all the papers! All the evening shows!
Thanks for taking the time to come talk to us.
Wha-?
There's something special hidden down here.
Nice place.
You some kind of lost puppy?
I-I-I don't know!
I'm sorry!
- He'd already been thoroughly disciplined. - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
tadori tsukenai mama We'll never reach each other now
hashi no shita ni tatte Standing here under the bridge
Oh crap, I just noticed that both discs of "Planet Octotea 2: You Got Severed" are disc 2!
What a complicated equation.
Like hearing yourself laugh for the very first time at something
neoki no kikku wa aisatsu gawari ni namaashi itsumo kizudarake A careless kick to wake you up, my defenseless legs are all scratched up
I wanna stay right here!
Chapter 87: "Vow"
But it's no big deal, right?
Please. I'm asking you as your lover.
Don't worry, Nino. Your lover is, as always, perfect!
Rec.
Time to execute my plan.
M-M-M-Master Ko! It's been so long!
- Some of you may laugh at such an impossible task! But I want you to believe in me.
You're looking good today, Sister. What's with the grisly getup?
What happened to you?
For what? Watch what you say, Sister. Your ugly words clash with your cute looks.
Chapter 89: "Under the Bridge Without Rec"
Huh? Rec, you bastard!
I was writing a song to cheer you on.
Once he wakes up from his suspended animation, he'll be chock-full of energy!
I'm already-
Father wasn't expecting any competition, so his plan is full of loopholes.
I am now forced to completely shatter his ego.
Why didn't you negotiate with your father first?
That man... what a fool!
One more what, Takai?!
A place where our beloved resides.
Guys! Me! I'm home!
She forgets my face, and now this?
So anyway, Rec... what's the deal? Do we get to stay here or not?
Stop messing around. Even if there were a stage, no stupid satellite would get to sing on it.
Your demands are all insane!
Ah.
You called to cancel? You mean, the Arakawa project?
Why? What do you mean?
Chapter 93: "TEL"
Yeah, why?
Yes, of course! I'm overflowing with energy!
Who the hell did you just call?!
aino kakera sagasu tabini Whenever I search for a taste of love
kimi no koto sagashite Searching for your smiling face
Not one damn scratch!
Be as loud as you can.
I'm sorry-my hand acted on its own! I'm sorry!
That sounds like a sad excuse from a weak man to me.
It's okay, Nino. I'll definitely call him later!
You're not scared, are you?
Show me what it means to be a man, Hoshi.
This is just like a rollercoaster!
Wha-?!
Chapter 96: "Changes"
Could it be?
No matter-
"Never be indebted to anyone!"
Of course.
Actually... we're getting kicked out of our homes.
I think it's time to put away these pseudo-stars.
All that brutality changed the mask's color...
Heeey!
I haven't heard that ringtone since I first set it up.
It may feel soft, warm, and inviting.
But like cotton soaked in water,
But I just-
Rec's father is released an hour later. Shimazaki comes to pick him up.
mou ikanakucha I should get going now
Relax, Rec. Relax!
Don't think about it, Rec.
Kan-
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?!
Umm... kan-?
Kanchil! Also known as the Java Mouse-deer!
Red Venusian! Blue Venusian! Yellow Venusian!
Then there are the ones who don't show up too often,
Samurai Then there are the ones who don't show up too often,
Unyielding We'll be focusing on three such characters today.
kiraija naino iyana dake yosoku dekinai kono kimochi I don't hate you, I just don't like you. I just don't know how I feel about you.
You too, Rec.
See? I told you.
- Hey! Sh-
Well?
That was an everyday Ryoma!
Anyone would try to dodge that!
Please, tell me, "I love you, Jacqueline!"
We'll consider it a field trip.
Well then what do you want?!
Give me one week, and I'll plan the best fair you've ever seen.
Master Ko, all dooone!
Ba-BUMP! Master Ko's Lap Freefall
I can just imagine what he'd do with it.
Even if I've never been to one,
Are you sure, Rec?
And look at the detailed-
We had a little issue with our budget, ya know?
A 3D theater, huh? We should be safe in here.
Sister's gun looks super-dimensional!
My commanding officer would often take me to the front lines.
Stop being stubborn, Rec. Let 'em ride it!
Chapter 106: "The Amazing Parade"
Mine's blue!
That's great, kids. Did you have fun?
I just remembered something... A day I spent with my father.
Oh... well...
The memory of today...
will be forever burnt into our memories!
sono kotae sagashite We keep looking for that one response
And there's no sign of intruders.
Perhaps
I'm sure he'd be able to eat it.
Cook anything, and he'll be fine.
Hey! Star!
I'm sorry if my looks fool you into thinking I'm a star.
No way! Don't you mean the poison-tester?
Hey, Ric!
Sure.
Stella...
Sis...
The dinner at which Team Broken-Hearted was born.
You guys!
Oh, you came to see me?
Doesn't it sound fun?
Maria.
But now they're shorn!
In just that moment!? Impossible!
It reminds me of the day we met.
Wow, he's kinda cute.
Yeah, he comes in every once in a while.
And a trip up top to be reminded of the real world, too.
I can't think of anything else.
That guy was me!
I thought was the type to be like the Mayor and pretend he wasn't human.
Of course it's my 'thing'!
I'll be nice and explain exactly why I wear this mask.
Yes... It was four years ago...
You're right. I'm no good at writing lyrics or composing.
I like it.
You're not the moon.
I got a call from my good pal John!
Nah, I called Elvis up live at home.
but she was sound asleep, so we just dumped the bed in.
Then that was a great trick!
Lla.
It's time to go, Stella.
Jesus, if you're across from me, please listen

Venus, that girl is always like that.
Even though this is due to a debt I created,
Come to think of it, Id almost forgotten that shes my lover.
Nino-san!
I see.
N-No, dont worry about me!
Well, thats right.
Whos singing the song that makes me crave for a bath even more?
That is all!
Like that!
We havent even held hands yet!
You dont need that kind of common sense!
A bath.
but if I spoke now, shed hear my tearful voice.
That means itd be really embarrassing if my tears were to start pattering on the water.
Rec, youll catch a cold.
Hold the introductions for later.
Hey, hey, if you dont eat the bones, your body will be all flabby. funyafunya- limp, soft, flabby
So the white stuff I saw earlier was
Everyone. Pleased to meet you.
Mass?
Oh, you mean Sister.
She must be as kind as the Virgin Mary.
Oh, me!
Hey.
Since you got here, more people have been coming in for confession.
This is all thanks to the teachings of the Ichinomiya family.
Kids nowadays are really eccentric.
It's okay, I get hot easily.
Even if I were to violate the public nudity law...
If you don't wish to see my ass, you can just turn away!
To succeed the company, I must rely on my own strength.
It was really hard to make him "burp."
No... No... No way!
Hey...
Oh, you're still alive.
No thanks!
Could this be...
Plus it's dangerous for a girl like you staying alone here.
It's about 8 billion yen I can spend on.
If she emits electric waves, then she's the real deal!
Just say it! Anything!
Say what? I'm trying to repay you.
It runs in the Ichinomiya family...
If the lifesaver wishes this...
Could you fall in love with me?
Ichinomiya Kou means every word he says, as a man.
Since I have to choose a new house anyway, the villa is fine.
This is the villa.
Greet the village chief, he's the person in charge of this riverbank.
Oh... okay.
People will hate you if you insult other's disabilities.
He's deceiving you!
W-What?
The upper part of your suit is already sticking!
Are you okay?
The rule is, to live here, you must be named by me.
Kappa doll?!
Well said.
Tch, all right then.
Futon?
Sure, no problem!
Though you did say that you'd forget about me after not seeing me for a day...
...I have to see.
Which country's emperor did this belong to?
Yeah, I'm sure it has been used for many years already.
No problem.
It's been a while since I woke up in the morning.
Ah, sure.
If I were to compare a human's heart with the ocean, the ocean would be stagnant.
Now I will hang this piece of art as a piece of dcor...
Could it be... that I've done something really stupid?
He'd kick me out just by having a debt...
You're totally inside already, aren't you?
This girl here is my lover... my girlfriend.
S-She's cute...
N-Nino-san!
I see.
Furthermore, what does Nino-san do daily?
Hey.
Yes?!
No idea.
The weather's great.
The public bath is pretty far too.
Who? Who is singing this song that tempts people to bathe?! ...
Really? Good for you then.
W-W-What are you doing?
Could that be why...?
But if I talk now, there'll only be a teary voice. lit. teary voice
Your hair's really stiff and hard!
What's this white stuff?
Yeah. They're all good people.
Sure.
Since this is a welcome party, I guess it won't be considered as a debt.
I seriously do not want to get too close over there.
Don't you know it's rude to simply give someone a random name?
My...
My house is over in Hokkaido and I haven't gone home in six years.
I'm sorry. Let me do it once more.
It's Sunday, what are we going to do so early in the morning?
We're going to the Mass.
We learned many things from a carpenter.
Ah, you must be talking about Sister. Of course we have one.
Then she must be a person that is as gentle as Saint Maria.
Listen to me, Nino-san.
That guy is definitely no Sister! This isn't a Mass either.
You hon't heed ho ahorogize.
I'm not envious of you.
Answer me, otherwise this gun...
Well then, Recruit.
--OP--
I-I didn't cry!
Have you... ever dated... Nino before?
It's fine.
Haven't?
And you said you two haven't dated before...
I'm actually more afraid of your imagination.
Yeah, I wish I could beat you up anytime.
Part 20 Riku's DeterminationResolve
So, I'll have to bring her happiness!
It's obvious, isn't it?
Shut up! So what if you're lovers?!
...perfect!
If I still owe hundreds of girls their favor by White Day...
However, I have spent last night reading up on information, so it should be fine.
However, my plan isn't that easily ruined.
...but a little sacrifice is needed in urgent situations.
...we'll seal off traffic entering Rainbow Bridge.
It's nothing, Prime Minister. Don't mention that incident anymore.
Nino-chan, please sing along with me.
Finally...
It's lovely.
During the bread eating contest, I gave it my all and achieved victory.
Yes, that's right.
A strong force of gravity is needed then only...
I felt that recently I'm able to converse with her...
Hold on. Every time Nino-san mentions Venus...
Oh, that must be because...
That's already perfect.
Part 24 Arakawa's One-Shot Performance Contest
Ahh, I'm so excited.
I think so too!
Cardboard the transformation!
I want to see that!
With me, it's a happy day!
I don't have time, what time is it? Class starts in five minutes
Don't wait, this is just a lull, I disappear with you in five minutes
It's a darkly lustrous ball of mud which only firms up when one squeezes it.
op
Ahh, it smells like summer.
He doesn't seem all that strong.
Yay! I wanna be first!
You're right. A grown man.
I'll be in front!god I want to say "form the head" here Line up, everyone!
Leave the construction to us.
Good work.
They all belong to those who have earned their money!
What, for research or something?
Have you been further downstream? Maybe there's a tennis court.
Once they start construction for real, we may not be able to live here anymore!
Really!
Go back to England right away!
It's somehow soothing my bitterness.
No thanks.
And there's even a little kappa broth...
You're living pretty well for a
Everyone was gathered here for Mass this morning.
What's up with this riverbank, anyway? It's not like it's been in the news or anything...
What do you want?
Why don't you spit it out, paper-shuffler.
Stay quiet, everyone!
Did you meet a lady wearing an apron before you came here?
Nino!?
A rock star's routine! The improvised song!
Name a topic, and I'll make up a song!
"I'm cautious, so I always rent at least three DVDs at a time.
Huh, wait, "Planet Barley Tea" is a two-disc set, isn't it!?
I spent my entire evening last night studying about it.
Then getting closer, am I right?
I'm good.
The distance for a first date!
Probably...
This is working, Recruit, so let's move on!
With that, we're now masters of distance.
There's no way... that this is... the end, you know?
A date needs... you know, that...
Ouch...
Ouch...
I, no matter now or the past, am still a Venusian.
Looks like it didn't reach the ocean.
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to know.
I'll be fine.
It'll probably reach the Pacific Ocean.
Huh? Nino-san, your face is red. Did you catch a cold?
Everyone!
Stance of Misfortune!
She speaks Japanese!
Oh, that's right, I knew Sister wasn't Japanese.
Good grief, I can't just drive you back. drive you away
That's right... They're...
...there are many under this bridge whom are free.
My boyfriend sure is kind.
Sister, how could you teach a small girl this kind of game?
Oh? You dodged it!
But, innocent children are quite...
There's no way she could have said underling or whatever.
Yes, Boss!
Why?
Yeah, that's right.
The name Maria really suits her.
Somehow I feel like my very own existence is being denied.
...her venomous tongue is out of this world!
Sorry.
I'm terribly sorry. seems like another language.. probably from Europe since he's from there. please double check with Luffy and Ketsurui, if it's another language, put that as sub
Sorry.
Oh my!
How much trouble do you intend to give me?
That's great. Who on earth...?
It's a new face. Looks pretty normal.
So those bananas...
That can't be! There must be some defect somewhere!
I'm sorry! I got frightened by a stray cat and I dropped the soba takeout.
Long time no see!
I should have guessed that they knew each other. OTL
I'm happy! It's really been awhile!
Everyone? So this vegetable farm is really hers?
That's harsh!
Really?
No wonder the amount of each one isn't that much.
That's amazing, Sister!
Somehow, the people here enjoy celebrations.
Why are you giving names taken from attack helicopters?
I wish that I could be a part of this family under the bridge!
That said, Riku, what's your job?
I say, Riku.
I'm sorry, Riku-kun. I was too concentrated on eating.
A gigolo...?
Yeah, all thanks to you. I wanna kick you off.
Nino comes every time.
Tch, you don't even have the guts to accept a challenge?
Hey, Hoshi.
It's a showdown!
Nino-chan, you must grab hold of a man's stomach if you want his heart.
Next episode, 6 Bridge!
--OP1--
I'll start first!
This doesn't even need a competition!
Even if every girl in this world has their hair turned into one length
Only your one length is the most beautiful
...they close their eyes just like that.
Riku, that's...
Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo
The ability to analyze and execute such a plan...
I know that, Dad.
Sure, of course, it's that one...
Is there a problem?
N-No way! Why are you saying that?
Gigolo Nii-san is bullying us!
I was showing them an example earlier...
Furthermore, she's teaching them through demonstration.
Nino-san.
Please forget everything Nino-san has taught you from this today on.
That's what I'm supposed to ask you. What were you planning to do?!
You two...
And... we knew at the start we'd be able to swim once we removed our helmets.
This is amazing!
Riku, you're really good at teaching. at? in?
We thought we wouldn't be able to swim in our lifetime!
Are you here for a bath?
What's bogus?
Made in me. Fresh kappa juice.
In order not to affect the lymphocyte's cycle, you must replenish the body's water...
When the body is sleeping, it'll attempt to lower the body's temperature.
Also, I don't want to deal with kids.
Good. I'll use this method to banish the lack of common sense for those under the bridge!
Good job! One more! One more! One more!
Just like it says on the necktie that's been the birthright of every Ichinomiya firstborn son.
No matter what.
Hey, drop those another inch and it's public indecency.
I've gotta be imagining this.
That's how I was raised...
I see.
No, this can't be happening!
Oh, so you are alive.
This girl saved my life!?
No thanks! I'm more than full now!
When I inherit the company and get to sit in the executive chair, it's thanks to her.
No thanks.
No thanks.
My asthma!
Well, maybe there's one thing.
But let me go home and get some sleep first.
Okay.
Hey.
Really?
Absence makes the heart grow fonder!
The chief?
So, what's he like?
I'm one of the chosen ones. But of course I wouldn't judge someone by the color of their skin.
Hey, mayor.
You'll make them feel even more lonely.
Your top is stuck to you! Come on, this is just getting ridiculous!
How sad.
What do you mean, don't get it? Sit down and explain this to me!
What do I do?
Not anymore.
By the way, my name's Nino.
Don't... Don't you resent it?
But she saved my life and she's laying down the law.
Very well!
Excellent. Looks like you're ready to live here.
Recruit!
Good enough?
Recruit is fine.
but it's just a sheet!
Oh.
That's how little I mean to you!?
I can't even tell if she remembers.
Can I look around your place?
Where are you king of!?idiom works in english too
Then it must be a lie!
Later.
I'm kind of relieved.
'night.
And...
A young couple walking on the riverbank.
We're in the middle of our first date.
Do you always just do nothing but walk like this on dates?
The main dish is yet to come!
I guess I'll take a couple steps back.
And then you can move a little to the right.
I know.
I get it!
Now we're officially masters of the sense of distance.
Hey, Ric.
Oh, sorry.
No, it's just the sunset or something.
She speaks Japanese!
Wow, amazing!
This is Stella.
Honestly... It's not like I can turn you away.
One of you take care of her.
What is it?
Wait, your siblings...
Well, ummm...
Stella wants to play...
Not a Kite!
Yeah!
You can't teach a little girl to play like that, Sister!
Only someone like her could threaten my neck when I've got a gun aimed at her.
Mistake!
Yeah.
You've gotta at least give the boss a "Miss"!
Oh, you're here, Ric?
Sorry, but can you help me with something?
Right there?
What's wrong, Ric?
"Lower than grass"!?
Sorry, Ric. To be honest, I'd already heard of you.
He let it go!?
Sorry.
Pervert.
Pedo.
Sorry.
You're so hard to get at.
Right now I've got to hurry, I meet you in five minutes
Even though we're never going to arrive
dialog
I wouldn't have it any other way.
The victor will be determined by...
And naturally, it's a song Nino loves too!
All right, go ahead, Maestro Ric. ugh this shit again
Or are you just gonna forfeit after seeing that?
Have you ever seen a face so relaxed?
After all, if I take your job,
you'll be nothing but an unemployed leech.
And teaching by example is really like her.
I don't get it!
All right, now I'll let go of your hands.
Here.
We're really floating!
It's great. You taught the Brothers how to swim.
It's true!
I'm looking forward to it!
Baths are great, aren't they?
You're wasting your breath.
Even if you mix it with a joke, I won't accept it.
Yeah.
Made by me.
Lymphocytes?
So I should go sleep?
You must be amazed at the depth of my knowledge,
I'd call you a hypochondriac old lady.
I see...
Plus, I hate having to deal with kids!
It's best fresh-brewed!
What good is a school to them when they don't have a shred of common sense?
Excellent!
Magic: Floating midair!
Help me!
Mayor...
The loser leeches off the winner for life!
We laughed without a reason
Even though we're never going to arrive
Pan, pan, here and there, pan, pan, not realizing
If you toss the chips in your hand at that girl, they just may be sparkling fireworks
Jesus, don't leave, hurry up and notice
That day, on the playground
Standing under the bridge, borne on the waves
Okay!
but I never expected it to get off to this bad of a start.
Nino, do you know?
Well, five or so.
Stella!?
Just shut up!
Hey, Professor Ric.
There's empty seats, so you can go ahead and sit down.
Well, maybe if you give me your shiri-kodama, I'll think about it.
Anyway, there's plenty I want you to know, no,
that I'm damn well going to tell you, so here, have a front-row seat.
I came to work on my new song "Ruckus in the Classroom".
Dammit, why is no one coming to class?
I wanted to start with common sense, but maybe it's time to meet them halfway.
Pebble?
Amazing!
You have superpowers just like us, Ric!?
If you wait until the men from the lab pick up on your esper brainwaves
Does it really fly?
Right, trillions. All right, cough up 100 trillion yen!
If you're too cheap to cough up protection money, you'd better shut down your school.
Why do you have to do that!?
You took away my brothers, calling yourself a teacher...
Looking at it, it wouldn't be like her to come to school normally.
Stella.
Come take a look, guys.
I took out that missile's fuse.
I just arrived.
Yeah, you are.
P-ko. Didn't you do that on purpose?
No! I'm way too clumsy for that!
Sometimes.
If you drive a car on public roads, you'll kill someone every hundred meters!
How about a makeover? they're just ueggroeugbhreuocrbhuoe every fucking shaft thing i've ever hated dealing with
Thanks, P-ko! I'm gonna go show everyone!
What do I do?
And wait...
Wrong!
By "insides" you mean "what's inside", right?
Growing up means being a bride!
Ban, ban, that farce again, a heartbeat too late
In the future, I would like to become a powerful man like my father.
You can't discern anything about so deep of a topic.
Of course, you'll get to keep the designer suit.
I'd rather be a
Ko?
That one made me sweat.
Oh, what a nice suit!
What great fashion sense!
Anyway, why don't you give me an example of a project you've worked on?
But there's been so many...
War never changes.
I'm screwed...
President...
That's enough! You can leave now!
At least that looks like it belongs in an office.
Anyway, enough talk about the business.
And who's the young lady?
Ms. Nino, have you
Perhaps I should try cutting my hair short for you, Star?
What!?
Someone more important to you than me!?
I'm so jealous!
He freaked even the bridge-dwellers out.
No need to thank me.
Nothing. Don't worry about it,.
There's no way they're... active.
What, Star!?
If you can't even kiss each other once, oh man, I'll be honest.
Plus, this situation totally proves they're not a couple!
Nino, we can talk about it later!
As a greeting between lovers?
What, are you hungry now?
She'd finally run out of love for me and my inability to think of anything but work.
You're lucky you were able to dissolve it.
What, you're going back?
But I can't beat motherly love. Nino... You could have been a mother to me...
That's...
I...
Oh man, I hope you're not pregnant!
He's weird.
Really?
If he had made even one false move, I'd planned on letting my finger slip on the trigger.
Shall we leave him alone for now?
That's too bad, Ric.
We're going to continue secret observation.
He's been like this lately.
ed
All right, that's all for today.
I'm sure he'd be able to eat it.
Why are you in such a hurry to cook for Sister, any
I want to thank him!
Thank him?
What a wonderful design.
No! No, you haven't!
Yeah, that's it!
That was close...
Then Sister's really always talking about...
That's it. That's how I'll finish her off.
With this, I will... destroy Maria!
A hundred times I'll make her regret getting close to Sister!
I love him a hundred times more! that gundam urge creeping in again. theee times more hurr.
I know about heartbreak... It's only natural that the heart hurts.
Our target is Maria! The head of Maria!
You should run away too!
After all, I knew you'd come running here to protect me.
Wait, Nino!?
You're just confused now, okay, Stella?
You're so useless, Ric.
I can't believe she got behind sis!
But now they're shorn!
Hello? Anyone home?
What did she just do!?
Maria used to be a soldier too!?
She silenced you!?
Training as hard as I can so Sister would like me!
Here.
Wait, a normal person's down on the river.
You're a parasitic life-form!
No shit it's a mask.
I thought was the type to be like the Mayor and pretend he wasn't human.
Then why do you always wear it under the bridge?
So he's going to talk about his past?
Yes... It was four years ago...
Why do you look so surprised?
That really hurts, man.
Did I go too far?
You're right. I'm no good at writing lyrics or composing.
Nino listened to my song.
The moon's up in the sky, silly.
And what's your reasoning for that?
You're lying, aren't you?
You're a sparkling first-magnitude star!
That's all that beautiful story moved you to say?
No, I just wanted to say that.
Yeah, of course I was. You're bringing back memories.
So tomorrow again?
but she was sound asleep, so we just dumped the bed in.
S.
Te.
Pan, pan, here and there, pan, pan, not realizing
There's no time to be shy, you'll be gone in five minutes
On my journey to pick up the pieces of my love
We'll always be looking for an answer
There's no time right now for that, class starts in five minutes
Here comes his attack, pretending he didn't hear my 'bye-bye'
For some reason I'm always so lonely
It isn't a shimmering glass ball which will shatter if grasped firmly.
Ahh, it smells like summer.
Sister, your cookies are the best!
Thanks a ton, Sister!
If there's anything you need, just tell me.
Why's sister only respectful to the Mayor?
He's kind of frivolous.
Man, it's hot.
Wait, it's dangerous! Kids should be in back!
You're right. A grown man.
Okay!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! should probably not sub these
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Oh no!
The Mayor is a man so valuable that he deserves to be revered.
I'm risking it all on this attack!
For him to use the water from his bowl...
But the CEO himself is in charge of this project, so...
Love thine enemy.
Is that always what you think when you look at people's faces!?
Episode 81 "Emergency Situation"
Once they start construction for real, we may not be able to live here anymore!
We're screwed!
Sorry, I don't think I can make it to Mass today.
When does the construction start!?
Whitey!?
It isn't the MLIT...
Never mind that!
Oh, my, a bureaucrat. How wonderful.
I have a request for the citizens...
Um, did you...
He's a completely different person.
They're really going to kick us out of here!
In the end, it was Germany's post-war democracy that gave rise to Fascism.
It has come to light that one of you dares bare his fangs against Honnouji Academy.
Amazing!
However, that uniform is wasted on your kind!
You aren't cut out to wear an Ultima Uniform.
the discipline of this school will remain unshaken!
Honnouji Academy, huh?
Like taking candy from a baby!
You're not getting away!
"Here hangs a naked pig that dared to defy Honnouji Academy."
Oh, so you're a transfer student, huh?
an8I sing a song of going to ground!
Who's the top dog at this school?
Why, that's
That's one of the Four Devas of the Student Council:
Disciplinary Bureau Chairman Gamagoori Ira.
They give you superhuman abilities.
Got all that?
So I hear you're the queen bee of this school.
You were surprised to see this just now, weren't you?
and they will become as strong as steel!
Yes, ma'am!
This is the one thing I'll never hand over!
I have no excuses to offer.
I've dug up some intel on her.
Inform the heads of all our schools to remain on guard.
Forgive me, Dad.
If only I were stronger!
Wha
Don't go!
The sailor uniform is talking?!
One hour from now, your friend here will be executed!
Using a hostage is a classic strategy.
Oh no! I'm in big trouble!
Ryuuko-chan!
But it's really a corkscrew!
Iron Fist Barrage!
Are you trying to use your feminine wiles against me?
No, of all sports!
This is an Ultima Uniform!
I don't know what you had hidden in that cloak you were wearing,
So that's the power of the Sword Scissors, huh?
And this Sword Scissor was left behind by the person who killed him.
Now, you'll tell me who this scissor belongs to,

This Sword Scissor was left behind by the person who killed my father!
you will lose consciousness in five minutes.
Don't sound so calm about it!
We'll talk about this at length the next time we meet, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
Don't let her escape! After her! After her!
Dad, what do you think you're doing?
Don't worry about it.
Better dig in before I eat it all!
You of the Sewing Club are the chosen elite of our Human Conquest and Liberation Project.
Carry out your work with the utmost care.
Tennis Club Captain, Hakodate Omiko,
Carry out your mission.
This is me.
This power is yours and mine.
I am able to explain phenomena that are occurring right now.
He was stooped, wore sandals, held a cane in one hand, and had a mouse.
My father made you?
It'll be a pain if I don't have anything to call you.
Yep! Pretty straightforward, huh?
Oh, that reminds me.
Mom said that
you can stay
She skipped yesterday's club practice.
Of course she didn't come to your stupid practice!
She's talking to her clothes... How utterly pathetic.
What, a total shutout? No challenge whatsoever.
Feed me more blood!
Now, now, calm down.
Understand what?
The first order of business is the Tennis Club Captain, Hakodate Omiko.
What's that about?
We have an unmotivated club member, so we are purging her.
This time, I'm gonna knock you all on your asses!
What?!
She's a rookie. I'll let her serve.
Ryuuko-chan, that was awesome!
Ryuuko, this is your last shot!
Catch!
This should do it!
Faul
It's creepy.
Otherwise, you're going to pass out again.
Ryuuko and I are helpless before that overwhelming power.
I might find some leads at this school.

By the way, do you play the guitar?
Who's the top dog at this school?

Prez...
Are those iron gloves?
but you're just a fool who doesn't even know how to wield that scissor, huh?
Not only did you allow that transfer student who mocked Lady Satsuki to escape,
But you know what?
My apologies.

At last, a Two-Star Ultima Uniform of my very own!
Fine. I'll make you wear me by force!
My memory...
I do know that the man who constructed me

She's already filed the paperwork!
Hey, what's the big idea?!
Stay out of this.
I'm Hakodate Omiko, captain of the Girls' Tennis Club.

She's talking to her clothes... How utterly pathetic.
Wake up, damn it! Hey! What's your problem?!

Screw you! There's a reason
Oh, dear...
I'm your homeroom teacher, Mikisugi Aikurou.

You're awake, Senketsu?
Why didn't you wake up when I needed you, you dumbass?!
Matoi Isshin, and its power surpasses that of the Ultima Uniforms.
Quit splitting hairs.
In other words, you've won the fight but lost the match!
What about yesterday?
She's a rookie. I'll let her serve.
Not bad.
Interesting!
You can't be serious!
It's all right.
You did it, Ryuuko!
That's because you drank too much blood!
i1At the time, I had no idea what "wedding dress" implied.
blur1kyou wo nugisutete
blur1With my own hands
A note?!
All I want is for you to tell me who the hell you are
These are the Godrobes.
I hate the Kiryuuins' despotism, too.
I was working with Dr. Matoi to try to thwart their plans for world domination.
Fine, then. I'll beat the truth out of her.

i1Commence sewing!
1 button location confirmed!
an8Welcome home, Mistress Satsuki.
Lady Satsuki, your mother has expressly forbidden the removal of that outfit.
This won't do at all.
This red blood is the eternal vow between you and I.
None on this Earth can surpass me, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
I really appreciate it.
Ryuuko, are you a... you know?
You aren't the only one in possession of a Godrobe.
But I won't give in to your intimidation, or it'll all be over!
I've already mastered the art of wearing my Godrobe!
Stop drinking so much blood, then!
I cannot be worn by you unless I drink your blood.
The fact that society's values shame you only shows how small-time you are!
Life Fiber Synchronize, Godrobe Senketsu!
Now you're going to tell me, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
That is totally fine with me!
Mako, your lunch is ready and waiting in the kitchen!
Is that clear?
Ryuuko, wait! You're the only one who can hear me!
You gave your uniform a name?

If you get sick, do you think you'll be able to work to your fullest potential in an emergency?
Shocker!
I've never seen anything like this before!
The people at this school sure love to hear themselves talk.
All right. Challenge accepted.
Are you okay? Your arm looks injured!
No, I can't let you! I'd only slow you down!
Hang in there, Maiko!
That's Ryuuko up there!
Keep your eyes on the road when you're driving, you fool!
Ouch!
My arm!
No way! They have it so easy!
Are preparations for the final trap proceeding to schedule?
Gosh, the view's so much clearer now!
Just a little further and we'll be in the Two-Star district!
Geez, what was your dad thinking?
What?
Maiko, what are you doing?!
This injured No-Star classmate was but a fake identity!
Maiko! Return that uniform to Ryuuko!
I'll have to try that for myself right away!
I did it!
Forgive me, Ryuuko. This woman has no shame.
It's not working!maiko bg
We have to hurry!
It's all over for you!
I swear on my pride as a Disciplinary Bureau member
You'll be late!

This is an opportunity to watch a pro at work.
I've been with Lady Satsuki the longest.
Where'd you go, Pervert Club?
My whole family's weirded out by it!
That's right! This uniform is Ryuuko's friend!
Don't you dare lay a finger on Ryuuko.
If you do, I'll make you pay.

She means to mass-produce Ultima Uniforms.
I'm amazed that there are even two people out there who can handle a uniform made entirely of Life Fibers.
Personally, I came here because I heard that I'd be able to fight with my full strength.
an8I expect you to surrender.
I've seen through your moves!
I trust you understand the price of failure?
I've managed to grow strong enough to defeat your middle-school self in battle.
Very well. See what you can do.
What's this I hear about you putting on your wedding dress?
Let's get right to it!
Three-Star Ultima Uniform: Blade Regalia!
It's not just the Godrobes that can transform!
Be it a movement of the eyes or a twitch of the muscles,
I didn't hear it that way at all.
Now I can read all your attempts to block me, too!
That's more like it!

I explained to her why I took out Junketsu.

Are they bringing down this academy,
My letter of resignation.
Huh? What are you saying?!
Snap out of it, you idiot!
Sorry, Ryuuko, m'dear.
Attagirl, Mako!
Wh-Why?
When I became club president and our lives improved,
You never attacked me all-out.
Nothing beats your mystery croquettes, Mom!
Enough with your impertinent questioning, Jakuzure!
"Naturals election"?
It's probably the other way around.
That's Kiryuuin Satsuki in a nutshell.
If something needs to be done, she doesn't hold back.
Whoa, this dump?
By my first year of high school, I was a full-blown juvenile delinquent.
There's nothing here.
Mikisugi's doing, no doubt.
Sorry. Looks like Dad brought home a messed-up scooter.
What's the matter? Did you break down?
Gamagoori! You followed me all the way out here?
What do you want, then?
That holds true even for you. Get in.
Get in, get in, let's go!
an8Hit someone from behind and you get a pileup!
True. Mankanshoku has never seen a red light in her life.
That's right!
Do you think you can escape Automotive Airsoft Club President Todoroki Ryousuke in that clunker,
Looks like we picked the wrong car to hitch a ride with.
And even if I did shed a tear, I would wipe it away myself!
You can play at being righteous all you want,
Come here!
Who do you think you are?! Guys! Make her suffer!
I am different!
And for two years, I waited.
Be careful.
You have done well to struggle through seven days of mortal combat

It's not showing anything.
Aye-aye, sir!
You bastard! What did you do to Mako?!
What?
Come again?
Do you think that I wouldn't anticipate something so obvious?
In that case, it's business as usual!
and thrust your blade into the uniform proper!
Then I'll just have to cut all the way to the inside!
That's the Four Devas for you! He has Ryuuko on the ropes!
So she can't possibly lose!
Impressive. That Godrobe is far more potent than any other Ultima Uniform.
I never thought that I could.
My own strength is not nearly enough.
Easily said, somewhat more difficult to do.
Did... Did I lose?
People are pigs in human clothing.
Join me there, and you will be able to attain new strength.
I will crush you here and now!
I'm not about to lose to you!
But I can't drop out. Not now.
What's bad around here is your luck.
Go get him, Ryuuko!
Let me show you the true terror of the Shackle Regalia!
I'm going to mold you into a proper student!

Struggle! Struggle!
In that case, taste the ultimate whip of love!
No! What's this I'm sensing?
Gamagoori, that was foolish.
Finishing Move: Thread Stripper!
You did it, Ryuuko!
Disgraceful!
It's too early to kneel in defeat.
That's one down, Kiryuuin!
But one genius is about to single-handedly alter the destiny of that company.

I thought you two went back further than any of us.
What are you saying?!
You're just assuming I'm gonna lose?! Nobody mocks me!
She's gonna fight while playing music?
The bass really reverberates, doesn't it?
Hey! I thought you were disqualified if you left the battle area!
Let's give you a taste of something bigger.

Certainly, cutting Life Fibers is difficult.
But what about the ground?

You're not getting away!
Barred from school grounds, huh?
I think those might be a bit dangerous.
Anyway, eat up, get your body moving, and sweat it out!

It drove home just how powerless I truly am!
Your fight hasn't been for nothing!
I won't give up, Matoi!
Quit it!

It bums me out that we might have to take on that monstrous girl, though.

But that doesn't mean you should go this crazy!

What can you do in that state?
Big words from someone who couldn't even synchronize with Senketsu.
What is with you guys?!
No, we're genuinely pissed off!we're not snapping "back" at you; we're just seriously ticked off
If it's for her sake, we'll gladly be smashed to bits or chopped to pieces!
What is wrong with you guys?!
I tested both Senketsu's strength and your own.
But I was sorely mistaken.
It's filled to the brim with some pretty incomprehensible things,
Man, even your apologies are overblown.
so I agree it's high time we stopped that mother of ours.
Now that you've made up,

She has ruled absolutely here, so by sequestering herself,
Still, this gives us a chance to let out some stress and enjoy ourselves.
The loincloth is mine!
Gosh, things sure are crazy in town, huh?
I swindled it from that scooter shop owner especially for you.
You have a point.
Wow, so you were poor, too!
Don't make a scene, Ryuuko.
But a cruel fate will lie in store for you.
Hold it!
When we lived apart, there were times when I hated him.
Calm down.
It must be brand-new! It's all sparkly!
Interesting!
Cry and shout all you want, but you'll get no mercy from us!
I would ask no one else to!
That's it! More! Punish me more!
The Kiryuuin Deluxe Trampoline bounces well, doesn't it?
Yes! That's more like it!

Eating Mom's boxed lunches gives you one million horsepower!
Did you come to cheer Ryuuko on, too?
She'll just be out for a little bit, so don't worry.
Like why my father was killed.
Senketsu and I will beat Kiryuuin Satsuki.
Begin!
I punish and punish and punish, bringing myself to a climax!
Now, let me show you!

So she can't possibly lose!
If you intend to rule this school with force,
If you know that, then why do you oppose me?
What did you say?
I'll show you that there are those who will never yield to force.
If your words are hollow, expect no mercy!
I won't kneel before you... Never!
I will fight against everything this world stands for
Vengeance for your father's murder?
And not just her!
What's bad around here is your luck.
Don't do that!
Learn your place as a student and quietly accept my discipline!
I'll never learn who killed my dad, no matter how long I try!
By shackling and whipping myself mercilessly,
I tried to set an example for the students.
"See my behavior, and correct your own!"
To those who still refuse to learn,
She is an exception!
Crap! I'm wrapped up!
If you do, I have an idea.
Got it!
I see that you have returned to a more proper appearance!
Having trouble breathing?
Your Life Fibers are totally exposed now!
You did it, Ryuuko!
Okay, let's get to it.

I care not for victory.
That data-lover is grandstanding again.
I thought you two went back further than any of us.
You're gonna pay for it!
Even the spectator seats have turned into a battleground!
Okay, for my first song, Light Cavalry Overture!

We can fly. Now we can go straight for our real target!
Here I come, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
What's wrong, Senketsu? Our connection feels weak!
She's altering the frequency of the waves Jakuzure is giving off to match her own.

Yes, overwhelmingly so.

It's inconceivable that she could have pulled and severed it in that instant!

Forgive me, Ryuuko.
Yup.
Gotcha.

Stop it, Ryuuko!

I will bring you back!yesss

That was such a boring ending.

What's the sense in destroying your own city?
Huh?
Yeah, but I'll get him back.
Oh, I get it, Ryuuko.
You've become even stronger than before, don't you think?
It's because what you desire is almost in reach!
Yeah, you concentrate pretty hard on that.
What is it?
Satsuki? Seriously?
I'm coming for you, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
It was back at the garden party to celebrate your graduation from grade school.

But this ain't over. Osaka's all about tenacity and conviction.
Looks like you're having fun throwing your weight around, Kiryuuin Satsuki.
You're going to give Senketsu back.
Can you take it back, Matoi Ryuuko?
Don't whine to me now.
I'm not whining!
That said, I doubt the good Miss Satsuki will just sit by and let us do that!
Impossible.
Are you that eager to die, Matoi?
Now I have it all back.
It has! Don't underestimate Matoi Ryuuko when she's concentrating on a goal that's almost within reach!
Have you forgotten the burning fury you felt for your father's killer?
That is why you wander aimlessly through life, bereft of ambition!
Lady Satsuki!
Right!
Just you watch. I'll catch up to her in no time!
Perhaps, but like this, you can never rise above me. Can you, Nonon?
What?!
Ryuuko!
Ryuuko, trust me.
Nice job, Senketsu.
Mutually assured destruction... Huh?
I won't sacrifice the lives of others to achieve my goal.
You wish to trade my life for theirs, do you?
Ryuuko, you dropped this!
Are you suggesting you've formed a symbiotic relationship with the Life Fibers?
Still, we should be grateful that we're alive.
I gave you my word.

Huh?
Why are you diving in?

It makes us want to hurry up and cover our bodies in the wonders known as "clothes".
As a Kiryuuin,

Correct.

That is COVERS.

The only possible conclusion is that, having induced mankind's evolution,

They were waiting for the opportune time.
Godrobe Senketsu was created by Dr. Matoi to fight against the Life Fibers.

So that is why Dr. Matoi created me.
That plan hasn't changed.
is a bit hard to believe.
Each one of those outfits contains Life Fibers.
We've also completed construction of the Ragyou Stadium.
We shall welcome you with open arms, Mother.
Ryuuko?
He's got a mind of his own!
Now you're telling me he was born to kill his brethren?
What are you doing?
Fine by me.
She was pleased with our results.
You did well on the Big Three Battlefield Trip!
We eradicated the dens of the Kansai forces and anti-clothing guerillas
Fine by me.
Do you honestly think a half-naked high schooler can beat me?
A girl only reveals herself in her full glory

After all, the reason you wear Senketsu is because you love him the most, right?

Thank you.
Ever since that day.
You... found it bitter?
And who are you?!
What do you want?
Very well!

Straighten out those lights a little!
Fine, thank you.
Life Fibers are the rulers of this world.
The weak will serve as the foundation for what is to come.
She means that the day has come for the pigs in human clothing to be consumed by their garments.
Sounds like it's started. Let's hurry.
He hates that name.
The time for speeches is over, Director.
Remember that, Kiryuuin Ragyou!
Honnouji Academy is the fortress I created in order to defeat you!
Thank goodness!

What's happening?
Lady Satsuki!
Though for a plebeian like you, that is still quite an impressive feat.
Though I'm sure you wouldn't have been able to even stand in front of me without its help!
Ultimately, Satsuki was never fit to wear Life Fibers.
Impossible!
Their sacrifice wasn't in vain.
All we have left now are Jakuzure's Bakuzan-Gako and Gamagoori's Bakuzan-Kouryu.
That Kiryuuin Satsuki girl is a real piece of work.
If I'd known sooner, maybe I could've done something to soften the blow.
but before I knew it, it was all I could do just to stay alive.

Even if that were the case, I am your mother.
No more, no less.
The work is progressing smoothly, I see.
Both of them have grown into fine young ladies, just like their mother!

It's ready?!
Stand firm!
I'm stuck!
Get clear, Mankanshoku.
Get lost!

I, Kiryuuin Satsuki, still have a chance at victory!
Hello, everyone! I have sad news for you today!
I'm a Life Fiber monster!
Isn't Senketsu your friend?
Turns out my whole life until now was a lie,
Do you hate your mother?
I can't wait.
Adieu, mon amie!
I mean, Senketsu's both your best outfit and your best friend!
There are no signs of any COVERS reinforcements.
So they were after Matoi Ryuuko, and her alone?
Ryuuko was crying.
I shall head for Honnouji Academy.
I can't leave Ryuuko on her own!
Senketsu, you want to go after Ryuuko, right?
After all, I feel the same way.dat blush

You heal pretty fast.
You didn't bring any?
It's smooth and easy to drink!
I don't know...
A ninja technique for freezing water?
Or a magic trick where you pull it out of someplace like you always do!
Don't let us down!
C-Carbon... carbon dioxide...
Wow!
It's snowing!
It landed kind of...
But how did you make this snowball?
What an idiot.
Let's drop by your place on the way back!
I want to look around your room and stuff!
An eye mask?
I'm just going to make you cover your eyes and plug your ears.
Earplugs too?
Yep!
The autumn of reading. The autumn of eating.
Your house?
There are a number of hidden mechanisms all over.
It's convenient, no?
A disappointing unexpectedness.
Ouch! missing line
It's fine, the gas is totally harmless.
I've got to carry her while she sleeps again?
Typhoons are exciting!
Wind.
Damn you!
I'll hold it.
W-Wait! You'll get wet!
That scared me.
The next day.

be4blur2I love you,
Now you try, Sonya-chan!
Why me?
What?! It was definitely longer!
You're hopeless.
You can't, Sonya-chan!
Agiri-san, can you read Sonya-chan's mind?
Hey, Sonya-chan, are you okay?
Yeah!
She's saying that she's about to break the record.
Why?
Ahh, this is safer.
How's that fun?
The 100 meter run is now starting.
Let's do our best, Sonya-chan, Agiri-san.
Now the time comes for my assistance!
I've found our fourth.
It feels nice to be on top.
So mean!
Ninja technique: Flame jutsu.
That's a really bad joke, so no.
No to that too.
Why do you have those?
...to hit someone in the face for fun!
I remembered how!
I might be a genius.
This again?
I'll check it!
I'm sorry.
Wouldn't it be hard to be good?
Wait! What was wrong with that?
That's right! Knives won't make people smile!
If you squeeze these, violet juice will come out.
Where are you going to get a monkey?
Alright! I'm gonna go to the home economics room and borrow a plate!
Good night.
That's how everybody does it.
What sort of charm is that?
Look!
What? Hell no!
Yes, you are!
You even took out your knife!
The mosquito was there.
...with all my strength!
There we go. I took it out.
I'll die from disgust...
Yay!
Don't they say that if you put all your strength into your arm while being bitten, it can't pull out?

i1Is this caused by something she saw on TV?
I didn't bring it, but there's also autumn amusement parks.
Is that you, Sonya-chan?
Speaking of which, I'm surprised you knew it was me.
Huh?
It's tighter than I thought.
an8Ow ow ow ow ow!
Will it come off if I twist it?
That's right!
and the can is totally gone!
Wow!
Agiri-san!
You're hopeless.
Here, paw.
Ow! Ow ow ow!
I see. So you tried to remove the can by pouring oil inside it.
She didn't fix anything and left again?!
I got it!
Then I don't need it.
You put something else in here, didn't you?
Here.
Besides, an idiot can't play an instrument.
I doubt it.
You're supposed to hit the instrument!
This.
Just you watch! I'll blow you away in one hit!
From the music room!
No sound comes out.
A dog whistle?!
It went in with one throw!
I must be gifted at this!
That's how it was.
I hear that winter comes at the same time for everyone in the northern hemisphere.
Isn't that great?! Your knives are actually useful!
100 points.
It's a magic marker, so don't worry.
You have no money because you buy crap like that!
That's annoying! Take this!
That's such a cliched mistake...!
Of traps, instruments, and stabbing.

You forgot what you lost?
So, what were we talking about?
I seriously can't remember what I lost!
Maybe it was an important secret related to the destruction of the Earth!
It's scary.
What's wrong?
Isn't that your usual knife?
It uh...
I want to try!
Come on, hurry up!
One!
Then figure it out.
I think it was really tasty?
It's food?
Do you mean this?
I'm just joking!
I found mine.
Huh?
Look, Sonya-chan!
Shut up.
Look at this!
Apparently it's been spotted in the mountain near our school!
No. If we can't find the Tsuchinoko, I was going to use that on any old snake and...
Sonya-chan, you're an unbeliever!
She's just making more stuff up.
You damn...
I think that's a pit viper.
Like I said, the Tsuchinoko doesn't exi
Poisonous snake!!
You little...
You moron!
He said he's an assassin!
Woah!

Oh?
Anything's fine.
Is it spicy?
Well, we didn't really...
Different people have different tastes!

We take turns putting our hand in its mouth,

You're being so annoying I was just wondering if you wouldn't go home already.
I said I'm not sick!
I'll bet you're at 39C already.
Oh? You don't want me to leave?
Delicious!
No, I don't.
Well, Sonya-chan?
I know, but you were pissing me off.

Besides, it's not hot pot.
I don't either.
Well, even if we're not battling for the cake,

an old man went up a mountain to cut bamboo.
Scary! What is this, a mutation?
That reminds me of something I'd heard about it.
I figured she was hiding somewhere, but I didn't think...
Anyway, it doesn't matter what tools we use, as long as we have mochi in the end.
She did it already?!
You mean when people choke on it?
Your neck?
No! Mochi got stuck in my throat!
I thought she was being too quiet...
I'm sure she's using a feign death technique, right?
Let me come with you!
I'll give you a reward as a loyal follower then.

This is...
N-No! I don't have any pictures!
Who is that?
A target.
You'll catch his heart?
Hey...
It's none of your business.

Sonya-chan, you're a bit of a scaredy cat, huh?
What are you talking about?
Around lunchtime.
Well, you're my friend and an assassin,
Thanks!
I'm not like you! Why would I have a real gun?
Gotcha!
Oh no! What do we do?
I ran out halfway!
Who's going to put it on him?
I know!
Well...
It's okay!
I'm here for you.
If I go in from behind, she'll hit me...
I wonder.
There's nothing here.
Nice...!
Now that I think about it, there was a ninja in my organization.
That's the famous "body substitution" jutsu.
I knew it was you.
Wait, a shuriken?
Of course.
Ninja technique: "Have your hair stay up even when you're upside down" jutsu.
If you really want,
Well done!
Well? Have you remembered those techniques?
Each one is 800 yen.

Who the heck do you think you are?!
If not, I'll just ask you again tomorrow.
I've seen in manga that you can escape by tickling them.
Damn it! Damn it!
Today, I made a nunchuck lunch!
You're a pro and yet you let it happen twice!
You're not getting away!
Now, now.
Well, you see, this forest is a shortcut to the park...
What would you like, Missy?
How'd you know? I didn't finish.
Would you like to purchase this Earth ninjutsu set?
I will now hide the bear off in the distance.
Fire jutsu.
That's annoying.
Ah, jeez!
Are you troubled by the disposal of a bee?
Yay!
Five-colored rice.
That's not a code!
Then...
And it's the same scam as before!
If that were me, I would've easily dodged
What do you mean, "Go get it"?
Because you're always pissing me off!
Not because I like it!
One! Two! Three!
All right, I'll go home.
It's dangerous.
Now, where could she be?

Forget the curse, you're pissing me off.
Oh? Weren't you a total unbeliever?
If something really does happen, I'll believe you.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Oh, it's Yasuna's voodoo doll.
What do you want to do, then?
While you're saying that...!
Hey.
How do you know?
Sonya-chan... water!
Look! Look! This is so fun!
Dang.
No, I...
No way.
Even though she's evil and has the face of a demon,
I hate his voice.
You can't use submissions in sumo...
Yasuna! Sonya!
Yasuna, Sonya...
Do you think I'll wear it even if you say that?
Yeah. You look good in it!

After all, whoever's guiding always gets hit on the head!
Alright, tell me where!
I can't trust Yasuna.
Uh, isn't this kind of dangerous?
I broke it before you.
It's gotten dark.
Oh right, I brought snacks!
Get it together, Sonya-chan!

I guess.
How about I take care of you before that happens then?
I said I'm just joking!

you can't carelessly attack.

There's a small transmitter that allows me to talk.
But then a bunch of bees came and now I'm stuck up there.
Run!
Really?!
Sonya-chan, please!
Because you kept buying useless stuff.
They took it...
Oh!
I do!
I'm gonna go buy some takoyaki!
What are you doing?!
I swam enough today.
H-Huh?
I know!
Please, Sonya-chan!
A-Alright.
It came flying while I was walking.
This isn't much, but...
Wow! What a nice ninja technique.
Then...
Shut up! Be quiet!
Release!

Now, what should I do with this?
Why am I an alligator and you're a cat?!
Don't care.

But it'd be suspicious if I had this on me.

Ready...!
It stopped...
She says that, even when she's holding her breath, she can use her techniques.

Five seconds left.
For you.
Ahh, this is safer.
If not a cafe, then how about we go the traditional route with a haunted house?
Are you scared?

There's no reason to use all my energy running for this.

It may come off with force!
I meant... hit my face.
But why?
Yeah! Now I can wear it whenever I please! take it off
Nope! Dunno whose it is!
Don't say you don't know, then.
Even if you can't play such a simple instrument, this is pushing it!
That's pretty arrogant of you.
Here.
Right! We'll take that anger and use it in an instrument you can beat!

Did you think it was just a flute?
If we keep walking, our feet will go flat.

If you were really lucky, you wouldn't have been almost killed.
You would always hit me, Sonya-chan,
I can't use luck with that...
It's good.

Dammit, where's she hiding?
We made too many.
Stop! After all that effort...
That was too lively...
Why didn't you lend it to me if you had one?
rice porridge.
Really?
It got worse...
You're being so annoying I was just wondering if you wouldn't go home already.
I'm looking forward to seeing your turn being sick tomorrow!
Oh, come on.
Based on what?
You were so noisy yours relapsed.
I'm going home early.
Dammit, my 100 yen coin!
Okay! timing check
Want to try too?
You don't know how to fold origami?
That much I can do.
The color has nothing to do with it.
Go!
After that. After that.
Another day. Another day.
A love letter?
A thumb tack?
Welcome to the Christmas Party classroom!
Is Agiri coming too?
There's still a week before Christmas, so I can't just give stuff away for free.
Here's a present for the good little girl.
I'm already full.
She never learns.
Drill tank!
Yep! Plum-flavored soda.
Here.
Also, the ending was terrible!

Why are you only telling me now?
Apparently it has no poison, but you can still kill people by making them eat it.
Do you use it for techniques or training or something?
No, but freshly pounded mochi is delicious!
There's the mortar and hammer!
Wh-Why...
She did it already?!
I'm sure she's using a feign death technique, right?
No, I'm fine.
Killtaro-san! I'm a monkey!
Crab!
Why is this happening to me?!
After a journey filled with trials and battles, Killtaro finally reached the island of demons.
And everybody lived happily ever
That wasn't happy at all!
I have some items!
She just made it worse!
Sonya-chan!
Traditional Japanese games played for New Year!
Fine, then there's a curse if you don't!
Whoops, it turned. Go back 2.
Oh, 9! Nice, I get the stomach!
This makes no sense!
Why leave? It'll be fun!
Fine then.
Let's go!
Kite strings hurt...
Seeing a squid in the air is really weird.
I'll just do this...
Fine, we'll use the backup.
Wait! Wait!
Is that the string for that kite?
What're you talking about?

I always mess up, but I'm trying my best to become a splendid magical girl!

Though the river's current never fails, the water passing, moment by moment, is never the same.
Wait, I think I had one in my pocket...
No... never mind.

Thanks. My eyes are open now.
Sonya-chan!
Valentine's day!
I don't need it!
Once you've accepted, you're not allowed to!
Okay.
A target.
At this rate, it'll get worse!
Not even by reflex?
You can do it!
I told you not to do anything!
Just pretend that I'm a dog.
That's a bit much.
Dream on.
Huh?
I just wanted to use the bathroom, but if you insist...

Hey look! It came off somehow!
How?
Whose?
Just be glad I didn't make it my birthday instead.
It's fine! Just think of it as having another birthday!
Ta da!
Don't worry, there are real presents for you.
And on that note, happy birthday!
It was just a clock...
That was mean, Sonya-chan.
That was just a dummy!
Hey Sonya-chan, since it's your birthday, why don't you try it on?
Ow ow ow!
What is this?
Never seen one?
That kinda pisses me off.
It's fine! Open it!
i1Th-This is bad. I can't let her go!
People will lose faith in you if you act like that.

Just a minute! Just wait for a minute!
What's with you?
Sonya, the penalty for being an assassin is 100 years in prison.
Is that where her target is?
Sonya-chan!
Whose fault is that?!
Oh! It's that dog!
Oh, I know.
I beg you! Let me get on your back!
I'll send help later.

Thanks!
Woah! She actually reacted seriously!
Don't worry! You can do it!
It's not that easy...
She's using a weapon to get rid of a dog...
He's just an ordinary stray.
If we stick this on him,
he might just leave on his own!
Eat!
Sonya-chan, whenever someone gets close to you, your hands automatically move, right?
That's weird...
Good morning!
Go by yourself.
Wouldn't that become a problem if there's a fire and the smoke rises up?
And here we are, at the rumored classroom!
You mean me?!
I'll take a look.
Don't take pictures!
Nice...!
This last one I'll show you is a big hit overseas.
Agiri-san!
Don't try to call my mistaking someone else for you as one of your techniques!
Yes!
Oh, so you want to be my apprentice?
Well done!
That's what the lighter is for...
Wh-What was that for?
Do you want us to have afros again, you idiot?!
Ninja?
Just goes to show that you can't trust her techniques.
She can see me?!
It's beautiful, isn't it, Sonya-chan?

C'mon. I'll treat you to something later.
No thanks.
You're not even being serious.
I'll stop if you teach me.
If not, I'll just ask you again tomorrow.
All right. I'll teach you a special move.
I think it fits for someone who doesn't understand until things are explained.
You're such a pain.
That's why you gotta keep moving so your enemy can't use them.
Let's practice it now!
Well, you see, this forest is a shortcut to the park...
I hear adding sauce to your crepe is all the rage!
Calm down!
You were supposed to throw it to the bear and run while you had the chance!
It seems that you're in quite the predicament.
That doesn't sound like a ninja technique at all, but please do it!
Oopsie.
It wasn't even a magic trick?!
I'll just buy the crepe myself.
Please don't be ninja-like only when you need to escape!
but it doesn't really hurt.
N-No, that's not what I meant!
I'll use my ninjutsu and do something about it.
Ninja technique: Disappearing Bee.
And mysteriously,
I don't know a thing about codes, either.
That's just as useless!
You offered to help, so follow it through.
The balloon's gonna shrink anyway, so who cares!
Wasn't that obvious?
You sure?
And what is that?

Oh, is that so?
She's a waste of time.
Nooooo!
Sheesh! I was playing hide-and-seek with her first!
All right, we're going to hide!
Be careful on your way home.

Now, what will you do, Oribe Yasuna?

...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe.
...sayin' "Take me anywhere, Just go!"
"Night of Summer Side"
Kurumi! Kurumi! Manami! Kurumi!
Huh?
What?!
No way!
...it wasn't.
It wasn't?!
Y...Yes.
Umao!
"Newtype:" the new generation, as opposed to old fogeys  parents.
I want to...
I do too!
Everyone's different, don't you know?!
Madoka! Haven't seen you around for a while.
A straw hat, eh...
Let's get going soon!
Let's go home, Ayukawa.
Yeah.
Yahoo! Looks like it stopped raining!
Yes, ma'am!
...witnessed a UFO.
Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment.
Next time: "The Summer Temptation - A Double Date Out of the Blue"
I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15 years old...
Yeah. That's right. Then, I'll see you in front of the library at 1. Okay?
You dog, Kasuga! You mustn't come to a fun place like this by yourself!
Boating? What a good idea! Let's go!
Hikaru... and Manami... and Kurumi! Let's!
Oniichan, don't you have to go?! To see Madoka?
Wh... Where did you pop up from?!
Okay? Promise?
Then, afterwards we can...
Huh? Afterwards... what?
Why, you! Hatta!
Don't you dare touch her there!
Get out, quick.
Am I pooped...
Darling...
Eyeeew!
No! No!
A fireworks show?
I had no idea...
You knew about it... The shadow cast upon my heart...
"Why do you have to leave now?"
At night the sighs softly snow on the city.
What am I doing exactly...?
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
Someday... Someday... Please let my body feel your lips...
Is this what people call the "Big Monday?"
Next time: "Madoka's Challenge! The Haunted Beach's Big Wave Legend."
"Yeah. A regular customer asked if I could use them, so..."
"But, I wonder, why this time of year?
The tears are falling on the reflected sky...
This island happens to be a well-known surfing mecca.
Still... it seems to me that there are a lot of mountain pictures in the set.
Hey! Can't you see that you're interfering with my work?! Why, you...
I mean... It IS the sea, at the height of summer... Right?
Gosh! It's so tiny!
Where are you off to?
The beach... it's getting polluted.
At times like these... I've got to protect her with all my might...
...felt so comfortable, beyond what words can describe.
Why you...! Gee...
Will you put me down please!
No way! It's crazy, not even Madoka could...
What? You mean, all of a sudden?
Just when I thought I was finished... I started to float all of a sudden...
Your boyfriend... saved me, I bet.
...and makes you crazy about me.
...is well... er... indescribable...
I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15 years old...
That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'...
An encounter is like a highway junction...
...by the time the seaport was in sight...
"Night of Summer Side"
I'm stuffed!
If I eat any more, I'll turn into a mermaid!
...so he could show off in front of Hikaru!
Let's just... head to that island for the time being!
It was a last resort.
Those two have the "Ears from Hell," after all!
"What he said."
I looove to travel by boat!
Huh? Oh, I'm sure they're fine.
No! This can't be!
Should we get going?
If we stay out late...
Oh, no!
Uh-huh.
Yuusaku, way to go!
C'mon! All I need is just a bit...
That was...
...but...
I couldn't help it, man! I was being a badass!
...ended.
Next time: "Hikaru Witnesses! The Camp is Full of Dangers!"
Please, please teach me!
Wherefore art thou, Umao?!
At our private school, you can slide like pasta from junior high to college...
What?! No way!
Darling, I'm sorry I said such selfish things to you!
Tonight, we'll be eating our meal outside.
This isn't good!
Wh... You ate all that already?!
So...
I wonder where he's gotten to...?
Are you mad at me for what happened earlier?
At that moment... I had completely forgotten about Hikaru.
Still, Ayukawa hadn't forgotten about Hikaru, even while practicing...
Oh, gosh...
What's wrong with that? We'll just go around the lake for a bit.
No, I'm not going! I refuse! No!
Huh?
Everybody wants to be with me all the time.
I can't believe it! How dare you look so happy?!
So beautiful...
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
Won...der...ful...
Look at me...
There!
No... it was seven times...
No, it was seven.
What's wrong?
What?!
Would that be a problem for your friends?
Th... There was...
...an irresistible yet d... dangerous scent of seduction in the air!
Hey, hey, did you know? We saw it! We did!
Oh... Gosh...
She was mysterious and had an air of dangerous seduction.
Poor Kasuga, chopped in half... I'm afraid it could happen.
He'll be back! We just have to wait!
Coward!
Awful...
an7Oniichan!
I'm sorry...
I'm telling you the truth!
We saw you holding her right here, you know!
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter..."
Flare, Flare, Flare like the Sun, Fire Love...
...when she comes back home one morning with a man!
The white flower petals on your soaking skirt...
We're busting our butts to finish all the homework before the new term starts.
For a stranger, she sure is rather straightforward about things.
"Yeah."
OOPS!
Come on now, let's get going. Come on!
You'll find out who I am when we meet!
Why you!
Hey, Hatta, who're you calling?!
What was that? A crank call?
Say, who was that?
You, babe, of all people?
Yup.
I...
That's what was on my mind.
Maybe I should go ahead... with Yukari to...
Wh...!
You're awful! Awful!
That's right!
That's right. Did you have an argument with him or something, Madoka?
If that's the case, then I could take care of him!
You're too simple-minded! Dummy!
Hmm... Still, how did you know that Madoka was performing here?
On vocals is my girlfriend... Yukari!
My heart feels more pain the more I examine it...
"Broken Heart to Dream..."
What matters instead is...
Yukari, would you knock it off?!
...I bet that Yukari's been a bit lonely lately.
I shall call it the "Hikaru Special!"
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer... "
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall... "
You were waiting for the lucky star in your room...
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
Next time: "Kyosuke and Madoka in a Big Fight - A Three-Legged Race of Love."
We've decided to go with Kasuga!
'Tell me, lover, Tell me that you need me...
There you are with that look of yours, looking dumbfounded...
You're walking on a tightrope with one arm stretched out...
Look where he's hiding!
Yuusaku?
Th... That was...
There you have it.
Why?
If we both get the first place prizes, then everyone's gonna be...
No! It's unforgivable!
Trust us!
Go up this passage here...
Well? Well? You'll pass a good 100 runners easily!
Indeed, we really had no idea.
Worst comes to worst, I've got to use the Power, or else...
Oh! You're training for it?
S... So that's how it was after all...
In all honesty, those were the words I've longed to hear.
Oh...
Why don't you try to get the Gold Medal while you're at it!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Well, worst case, I can use the Power...
Say, Hikaru...
A... Ayukawa...
How dare you!
Oooh, I wanna get myself out of this...
Kasuga.
...of what?
For somebody's sake...
You know, looks like my cold is gone!
Yeah...
He does things like hugging Ayukawa, or flipping her skirt up...
"Oneechan:" lit. Big sister. In this case, any older young woman.
Oh Baby, Tell Me, Tell Me - You're unpredictable...
Man, I'm starving!
Pfhhht!
Got somethin' to say?! Huh?!
Geez you'd better...
...watch it, yourself!
Whatdijasay?!
Thank you. How old are you?
Five!
H... How dare he touch her THERE!
...glamorous!
B... Bye!
I've got a feeling he's bad news...
Ayukawa's skirt looks... so nice today...
It... It can't be...
Huh?
Yahoo! Yeah!
He's just being a brat.
No matter what he tries to say... or do...
What's wrong?
Where did that brat go?!
Oh! Hikaru!
K... Kazuya told you something crazy, didn't he?
Right... how could anybody...
Let me clean that up for ya. Come on.
Ayukawa...
...let her leave me...
What?
I... I was... at that moment...
Oniichan, you should make up your mind!
Tell me why, when you winked...
Darling, you're so wonderful today!
G...Goddammit!
Wh...What...What happened?!
"Komatsu-kun?"
Isn't that what it means to be young?!
Isn't that what our youthful days are all about?!
Hey!
You're not supposed to do that!
What happened this morning was... well...
What? I can't eat another bite.
They are so wrong! 'Cuz I'm the one who first discovered his charm!
Huh?! Yeah...
He's just trying to look cool in front of you, that's all.
What?!
Oh?
So, what is it that you want to talk to me about?
Don't put me on.
Well then, I'll meet you in front of Mbius at 7.
Be sure to dress sharp!
Well? Shall we be off?
What is it?
Indecisive?!
Indecisive... Indecisive...
...when I think that it's something that I did...
OH MY...
Howdy!
Would you PLEASE let go of me!
Tell me why, when you winked...
Would you PLEASE let go of me?!
Ow... A...Ayukawa!
If you knew that then SCRAM!
Wh... What are they teaching you in pre-school these days?!
...peeked into real good!
"No Parking"
Geez I knew it! I can't read anything!
Gee... I would've much preferred watching "Godzilla 3-D!"
You sleepy-poo! You're so cute!
A-ha. So you're "Madoka the Pick," eh?
I was wondering, cuz I haven't heard much about ya lately.
Or, perhaps I'm a fool to ask such a thing?
You bitch!
Okay, let's get going.
Oh! Watch out!
What? Oh, no, not really!
To be honest... I realized just then that...
But... I feel like I'm being a Peeping Tom.
I see. Kasuga, huh? I haven't seen him lately.
Oh, gosh! Don't look at such a silly thing as that!
Don't tell anybody! If he hears that I've kept this picture...
On the contrary... she was most definitely thinking of me!
What?! Kasuga!
Oh, no, you won't!
Ayukawa! Wanna eat burgers or something before we leave?
To make up, y'know. Maybe we could have a bite somewhere...
...I was too late to notice it in that one phone call that day.
As I tried to kiss you, as if to avoid me...
Spread open upon the surface of the blue water.
...to tell me that you'd be mine...
Tell Me, Tell Me - but you're a mystery.
It's the beauty of "friendship" at work... something that's so touching...
But, still... how did it happen?
Was it an accident or something?
Is coffee okay?
Hold it, you!
The one who got hurt recently.
"Hurt?!"
Ayukawa!
I've got to protect her with all my might... or else!
Okay then, I'll see you later!
Okay!
Please, go ahead and enjoy!
What?
You don't have to do this, you know, Hikaru.
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey! Enough already!
We're joking! Joking!
Huh? Like this?!
All sorts of things need to get taken care of, so...
They're digging how admirable Hikaru is, never mind that it's just a film!
Dude! You stud!
I wanted it to be a secret though!
I make it with my 100 pure concentrated gusto!
...might be better off.
It's GOOD!
...thinking of you... hoping that you'll get better soon.
Goddammit! Think you're so tough?!
Yo, get 'em good!
Hatta!
What?!
Step outside!
When you said "payback," you meant THAT kind of "payback?!"
Tell Me, Tell Me - but you're a mystery.
Huh?! What the heck is this?! Huh?! Oh?!
And why not?! It's Manami's Super Makeover!
Kyosuke!
Oh, gosh... You got me!
Oh!
"The guest from next-door is a guest who likes to eat persimmons a lot!"
Whew! That was a close call!
At that moment, I felt as if...
I'd be better off buying the materials and making one myself.
...I'm just wondering but... did you run away from home or something?
Oh, no!
Your brother must be lacking in tenderness, eh?
Oh, no. I didn't mean it in a bad way.
Well, it's not as cool as actually flying, but...
...and then...
Nobody knew...
We're SO happy to have found you!
Who's that?!
M... Madoka...
I know! You want a lover, don't you?
...with your T-Shirt on, you dove into the shining sea...
Spread open upon the surface of the blue water.
...to tell me that you'd be mine...
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
It's just a thought, but... maybe Jingoro's entering puberty?
That's true.
Huh? Then, that means...
W...Well... Well...
...that it was you who desired me!
In Autumn or Winter..."Anytime..." I'll give you my special love, just for you.
What?
Being all by yourself... it gets quite lonely, you know.
Being alone...
Hey, guys! What are you up to?!
Will you calm down...
Hey! Hey! Hurry!
There's another one still out there!
You're scum...!
Nope. Not yet.
Not gonna happen, or will it...?!
"Meow-Meow With A Punch!"
I'm the assistant host, Hattatei Buri!
Don't you "whassup" me! We've been lookin' for that cat, y'know.
We know all about your type, babes that claim...
Hey! Hey! Jingoro!
Uh-oh!
Oniichan! What's the meaning of this?!
Huh?
H...Hey, Kasuga!
Hey, Kazuya! Where did Jingoro go?!
What a cute one.
So, you're the one... the weirdo who lets us take care of his cat...
Mommy...
Wh... Oh, er...
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."

Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter..."
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
How dare he be such a double-dealer?! I won't let him get away with it!
Tell me why, when you winked...
Why, Kurumi... It's you.
No... I just couldn't fall asleep, so...
Y...You?!
What do you want?! You're grossing me out!
Which means...
Hold it right there!
Hayami! All right!
"Hayami?"
I'm wondering what I, as her brother, ought to do.
Huh?!
Oh! Yeah!
I won't let this Hayami guy get away with it!
With this disguise, I'll find out just what his true feelings are!
Umao!
Oh! Y...You must be thinking how exciting that is...
Th...That's perfect... Manami...
H...H...Hayami...
Umm... Those are mine...
Kurumi...
Huh?!
I love you!
Kasuga!
Kurumi!
Gosh! Madoka, is that so?!
Hey! Hayami!
I'm sorry about before... I was so mad that I... well...
Kurumi...
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
That's what's written on your profile.
S...Suicide?!
...with your T-Shirt on, you dove into the shining sea...
Year 3, Classroom "A"
He made a "Love Attack" on her!
Knock it off!
Did you give him an answer yet? Hey! Ayukawa!
...why don'tcha think more about the ones you love!
Let's go home together!
Ooooh! Why, that Yuusaku...!
I have no idea! All I want to know is...
"I'm gonna be in a Judo competition!"
"What's the story here...?"
I can't let it go on!
Gotcha!
Oniichan!
Hey, your ticket!
...the one after the one that Ayukawa and Yuusaku took.
Ayukawa will... No, she wouldn't...
"Please."
Don't... Don't do it, Ayukawa!
"He said he wanted to train by getting pounded on by the falls...
"...when someone like Yuu says it, so straight from the heart...
Oh! He brings Hino down with a Major Outer Reap!
...then you'll be the same old wimp that...
Go for it, Yuusaku! C'mon!
Score!
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Oh Baby, Tell Me, Tell Me - I know that you're in love...
I don't have time to be playing games... I'm gonna be late!
Oh, Manami...
What?!
K...Kasuga!
What?! Gosh! Kurumi's just exaggerating!
We're not fighting even a little!
We were trying to surprise you, but we... we...
...apparently I am now here about an hour earlier than I was then.
Yep!
What's wrong?!
Oh! Gosh! That explains it!
I was just thinking, what would I do if you really came on to me?
Your feelings for me, Darling, are all I want.
Go start the party without me.
Darling...
Exactly.
Huh?
Which means that wouldn't be as much of a problem as it has been.
Dream on!
One of us has to leave this time-line.
I was in a self-hypnotic trance.
Huh? Oh, th...that's right!
Umao!
Like that?
You idiot!
Falling down those steps twice was certainly painful, no doubt...
You were waiting for the lucky star in your room...
Flare, Flare, Flare like the Sun, Fire Love...
Erase the memory of you from me... "Stop, Stop, Stop."
One bite of this, and you won't be able to hide your innermost, true feelings.
Ayukawa...
I despise you with all my heart, Sempai! Don't come closer!
"Wait!"
Darling...
Darling! Darling!
...the "Asaohyou Hyou" Mushroom...
I wonder!
If... If it's really true...
How should we choose them?
Because...
How should I put it...
No thanks.
Kurumi, you're so adorable!
You could say that she's a walking Mushroom of Truth!
...that's right here.
Okay!
No! No! Watch out!
You see this? It says so right here!
I...I'm sorry! I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier!
A-ha! Found it! Found it! Found it! Here it is!
With this much, I can discover everyone's true feelings at the same time!
I clipped the nail too closely three days ago. alphaHFFUrk!
I clipped the nail too closely three days ago. rGreenUrk!
You laughed your way through a love confession?! What an oddball!
Hikaru's trying to cross that suspension bridge!
Th... That's...
Sempai!
S...Should I use the Power?!
Ayukawa!
C'mon!
Cute.
You were waiting for the lucky star in your room...
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter..."
No, you can't do that!
As I tried to kiss you, as if to avoid me...
...since there was going to be a festival there.
Who knows...?
Oh, yeah!
Oh! Kyosuke, you're early!
Long time no see!
Think so? Er, Grandma... That! That! That!
Grandpa...
...be discreet about the fact that we've got special powers...
Y...Yes!
What is it?
Darling, take a look at this! Huh?
Wow!
What are you doing, Darling?
I think it would be nice if you took your shoes off.
"Oh? Are you a photographer?"
"I said no, and I mean no! It won't happen; I won't let it!"
"My daughter is different from the likes of you..."
And... on the night of the festival...
...that fool... returned.
Darling! There's Jingoro!
Hurry! Hurry!
Wow!
Oh! That kappa doll is so cute!
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
Erase the memory of you from me... "Stop, Stop, Stop."
...I somehow became Komatsu and Hatta's slave...
Next time: "Perverted with a Camera! Robot Kyo-chan."
Kasuga...
As I tried to kiss you, as if to avoid me...
'Tell me, lover, Tell me that you need me...
All of a sudden, he's doing everything we tell him to!
Huh?
"Companions." The professional ladies who define beauty!
Ain't it grand?! Ain't it grand?! Oh, it's too much for me to take!
One, two...
Oh! Look! A dog just pee-peed! rWhiteOh! Look! A dog just pee-peed!
Trouble! Trouble!
Say, do you feel chilly... down there?
Kasuga, you're the best, man! You're a genius!
Oh? rGreenOh...
Kasuga! Where did you go? Kasuga!
Huh? Wh...What?!
Help out Hikaru, go on!
"Lightly-built..." and...?
"...never gives a clear answer..."
Don't you think it's beautiful now... my room, that is?
Why can't you shut up?! There's nothing for you to carry!
Oh! Er...
I saw him a while ago walking around like he was in a daze.
Anyway...
Hikaru! Oh!
Geez, man! Having you around just means more work for us!
Right!
Oh? Er, well...
Didn't I tell you Kasuga isn't here?
Thank you.
Er... Please.
Kyosuke-niichan, get me ice-cream!
Well, but, even so, he didn't get me my cigarettes...
I told you, I ordered him to get me ice-cream right after that!
That's strange... Maybe he's gone back home?
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter..."
On that last night we went out for a drive, I left my go-out voice behind.
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Oh, no! I carelessly used my Power...
"Yes!"
Huh?
But, we're supposed to be "sukeban girls," right?
Do you understand what you're saying?!
Don't play dumb with us, man! Eh... Mr. ESPer!
No... I'm not at all what you think I am...
We've made it! Hollywood, here we come!
The Cannes Grand Prix to boot!
...but, heck, you're dealing with Yuusaku!
"For real?!" Are you serious?!
Y...You idiot!
Rather stubborn, don'tcha think?
You idiot! Don't be so direct, or they'll get suspicious!
Yeah, what a bastard he is!
N...No... I'm sure Darling must've had a reason for that...
What?
Y...You're kidding!
What?!
But, what if something happens...?!
Oh, no need to worry about that.
Since Hikaru got involved, they've really put the pressure on me.
The chances that I'll be able to stay in this town are getting slimmer...
I want our memories...
Darling!
You idiot!
Gosh, I guess I just have to...
Of course she did.
Geez, Hikaru's letting her imagination go wild too!
...come and challenge me!
Oh! Oh! I'm falling!
Oh! Darling... I'm sorry! I was... I was...
You're gonna fall! What'cha doing, Kasuga?!
Do your teleportation thing now!
T... This can't be!
I've got to tell her!
Manami! Did you...
Kasuga's what...?
Huh...?!
Next time: "Heroic Orange Legend! Madoka's Duel in the Blizzard."
'Cause I love you...
...and further from my face. You've broken my heart.
...but my pride keeps revising my dialogue...
"No... Please don't accompany me.
It's nothing, really.
Oryuu!
Why don't you stay over...
You said it! Really, there's nothing worse than sukeban!
You don't stop, do you?! Why, you!
Darling! What should we do?!
"Say something, why don't you!"
"You didn't even lay a finger on them."
If... If what Hikaru said is true...
Yes!
Keep her busy a while longer.
Oryuu...
Don't move a muscle.
Oryuu! Are you all right?
Have you lost your mind or something?
I'll be fine. Trust me.
Oh! Is that right?!
The days we had to be apart made the memory of you...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Each time we're hurt we learn...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
But, if I'm supposed to bring only one date, then...
The color of my manicure, as it dries...
The Actress in the Mirror...
The Actress in the Mirror...
The Actress in the Mirror...
...the seriousness of the crime. You've broken my heart.
Kyosuke Timetrips! The Third Christmas.
Yes!
H...Hikaru...
Dammit! Hikaru was...
...gonna be... gonna be my date!
...turn right at the third corner...
...then when you see the convenience store on the corner, take a left...
I had so many choices that I had a tough time decidin'!
Huh? Oh!
She's Tamiko the Macaw. Be kind to her.
I'm Tamiko. I'm Tamiko.
Whatcha gonna do during the dances?!
Kazuya, Jingoro! You can come out now!
What's up with you?!
Hey! You have to come as a couple in order to get into this party!
She's Ruriko the Goldfish. Treat her kindly.
H...Hikaru...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Kasuga!
Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?
Yes?
Well, whatever you say, sir.
Huh? Oh!
Oh!
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
The Actress in the Mirror...
The Actress in the Mirror...
Yup... 'Twas a dream...
Still, talk about a wild dream!
Now you've entered the hypnotically susceptible state of "Deep Sleep!"
No, no! That's not sitting!
Oh, that's right...
But, now wait a sec... The dream I just had...
If that was a Foreboding Dream...
Say... Oniichan, what's wrong?
Clearly, the Otoshidama is tempting...
"Hypnosis" sounds so... laid back for New Year's Eve, eh, Kasuga?
Yeah.
Oh. Hikaru...?
If you'd like to, the water should be perfect by now.
What?!
For instance...
Er... Never mind!
...there was no way that we should be bathing together.
Hey, girls!
Yes, sir.
M...Madoka, you're not completely innocent either.
Y...Yuusaku!
What do you think, Master?
The bath... It feels perfect now.
Now he's done it to Madoka as well... Kasuga Kyosuke...
I wonder if she's still a bit embarrassed, even when under hypnosis?!
"Er... Er... Hikaru!"
"No...I, er..."
Dammit! There!
Huh?
H...Hold it, you! Ayukawa!
...is an angel.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Each time we're hurt we learn...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
In the days when creatures we now call "Monsters" were just beginning to surface...
...people who feared their strength assembled a team dedicated to their elimination.
Angel Leader, roger. Angel Leader, to all aircraft...
All aircraft, prepare to engage!
Fire the missiles into the side of the belly, then immediately pull up!
We'll try it again!
What in the world is it doing here?
You should be thankful that you get...
"Orange School"
I'm sure that the Black Fighter will protect us all.
In preparation for the battle in our homeland, we at TAP HQ...
Yo, my man! My man! My man!
So, okay, won't you, er, just a li'l...
Perhaps it thought the lighthouse was a fellow creature.
...around noon tomorrow, but they haven't been right yet, so...
No! We're doing the Black Fighter!
Oh?!
...I feel as if you're hurt more and more.
O...Oh, gee! I'm so used to doing that all the time that I...
We'll make him drink it!
Huh...?! What in the world is that?!
How could a cat pop out of the sea?!
All right! Launch Captain Ayukawa and the Black Fighter!
Kyosuke... Please... Please come back safely...
Your weapons aren't gonna do it, just like I figured.
Stand aside and let me handle this.
We started this! It's our job!
In the old days, we used to...
You stay out of this!
...your heart was in everything you did... I loved that about you.
Yuusaku! Now!
Ayukawa!
This monster has truly unbelievable power!
Don't forget your role! Your role!
Jingoro... Jingoro...
Wh... What the heck is that?!
'Cause, my track record of luck... It's something.
This makes me look like a complete idiot!
"I just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
Kasuga!
...but uncertainty whispers into my ear...
...and further from my face. You've broken my heart.
The Actress in the Mirror...
We'll aim for Wimbledon! One, two! One, two!
Thank goodness!
Everyone! Say something, won't you?!
A red fog?
Ow!
What I've lost is... this!
Oh! Come on now! Oh! rGreenOh! Come on now! Oh!
Umao! And, wherefore art thou, Umao?
Kyosuke, lose! Kyosuke, lose!
Kyosuke, lose!
'Scuse me for a second!
I've got to get it out quick!
You wanna kiss Hatta?
What the...?!
Umao!
Ushiko!
Misunderstanding?! Ha! You pervert! Stop following me!
Oh... Oh, shoot!
But, why is Oniichan in the Girls' Locker Room?
Rewind?!
I don't care how much I get misunderstood...
I just don't wanna let anybody else kiss her!
Of course I am! I can only rack up points from you, after all!
And so, we hung tough, and now we're only a point away from victory...
If I win this point, Ayukawa won't be kissing!
"Why can't we be like the way we are?!
What?!
"Snow White?!"
Because you wound it backwards!
"I just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
"I just dance in the sweet memories"
I just find it hard to understand how...
Next time: "Such a Popular Madoka! Kyosuke Finally Reveals His Feelings."
Ayukawa...
A-ha-ha...
Rhett! Rhett, don't go!
Yes...
"Tara-Chiri:" Fish soup.
Please... take this!
Uh-huh... kinda...
"Jumping Knee-pat!"
Well, Madoka's the type that younger girls would look up to.
Boy or girl, everyone adores her. Her appeal is bi-sexual!
You'd better be careful too, Oniichan!
Um... I knitted this for you.
S...Sumire!
I know... We're both girls, that's what you want to say, right?
But, more importantly...
Oh, Oneesama, you're mean!
I'll kill myself!
You're not serious!
What the...?! What are you saying?!
...we went over there, and look what happens!
...there are people like that, yup!
Oh! Listen, you!
Has he done something again?!
...these days it doesn't matter at all if you're a boy or girl.
They rode the trolley on a journey into a world of their own.
"Please come to the old factory site's materials lot after school today!"
What?! At the former factory site, right?
Believe it or not, Mr. Matsuoka is eloping with Kasuga!
WHAT?!
"...that not even that tramp can break it! That's our act!"
I'll feed you your lines, okay?
Madoka, you should be looking into Sempai's eyes!
Anybody who dares to interfere with two people in love...
I get it! This was all a skit.
That's not it, Sumire...
Kasuga...
Hey! Kasuga!
Kasuga!
I won't let you get away, Kasuga!
The trolley... is leaving me...
I already have my Darling, thank you!
I hung up the phone, when you called to cancel the date...
C'mon, don't you wanna?
Really! I can never understand how kids think!
It'll be fine. You can learn to play anything quickly, Darling.
Okay... But don't blame me if anything goes wrong!
Yup!
Our group's name... It comes from Hikaru-oneechan's name!
Hey! Kazuya!
Huh...? Oh...
Thank you.
Uh-huh...
Oh! No! I'm only in junior high, so...
"H...Hikaru..."
"Darling... Where were you last night?"
"You really want us to win at the Music Festival, isn't that so, Darling?"
Hikaru...
Darling...
...but, as it turns out... I'm playing the fool.
Hikaru-oneechan is...
But I heard the sound...
Pfhht! I'm perfectly fine!
...snowflakes dance on the platform, and you came running, out of breath.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
Next time: "The Taste of Love? Kyosuke's Hellish Valentine."
H...Hikaru!
...but uncertainty whispers into my ear...
...the seriousness of the crime. You've broken my heart.
It's because you don't brush your teeth after eating all that candy!
Oniichan, you take care of things from here!
Aha... Yuusaku, the chocolate did harden, right?
I'm amazed that you'd stoop this low...
Where else?! The school! School!
Oh! Good morning!
G...Gosh... B...But... these are...
Well... I'm sorry for doing the Kramer vs. Kramer thing!
Geez! This is so lame!
You haven't changed at all either!
Huh? Oh, no! That wasn't exactly a compliment...
I gotta pee!
Anyway, I've got to find Kazuya ASAP and switch places!
Ushiko!
Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?!
...Valentine's Day is diabolical, isn't it?!
Yippee... Darling!
Wh...Who did you get them from?
Who gives a damn about...
This is awful...
Just what's he... really up to...?
A...Ayukawa... I mean... Madoka-oneechan...
Oh? What... don't you like chocolate, Kazuya?
Y...You know, I think he went out with Hikaru!
Uh-huh...
I see!
Is that for real, Hikaru? Now that's really awful of Kasuga!
What? M...Madoka, did you have something arranged for today?
Hikaru! Kazuya can't understand things like that yet!
Huh? Oh?
Huh?
Now, wait, Kasuga... Don't you have something to tell us before you go?
I... I...
You idiot!
Madoka... Forgive me...
But, it's my fault that he's acting this way.
K...K...Kazuya!
Pardon me.
My! You always have the upper hand, Madoka!
Uh-huh...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Each time we're hurt we learn...
I've shed a lifetime's worth of tears!
On usual, precious nights, I'd be riding by your side...
...as you take me in your car for a ride.
"...I was a bit abashed or so I felt..."
G...Guys, knock it off!
An exchange-diary?
Let's see...
So I'll... make you a little of this and that, tomorrow at my house.
Ayukawa's home-cooking, eh?
Oh, I know! Sempai...
W...What I mean is that... Hikaru...
It's such a shock, ain't it.
She was so full of energy.
Taking the life of Hikaru, an innocent girl with the soul of an angel.
Huh?
For Hikaru's sake, you've got to... pronounce the eulogy!
Including Hikaru's share, as she...
...can't study anymore, even if she wanted to!
Ayukawa!
Ayukawa!
And, who knows when it'll be our time to go?
B...But... there's no need to demolish it!
That's what I'm doing for Hikaru.
Guess I'll see you around.
Yahoo!
Umao!
B... But...
I'm in... l...
...I...
Kasuga... I've been waiting for you...
I'm done!
...I tried to pretend that there wasn't a scent of lie.
The Actress in the Mirror...
Got to be able to cry...
The Actress in the Mirror...
One Snow-White Night! Two, Alone inside a Gondola!
Sempai!
Yo, Yuusaku... You all right there?
Thank you God!
Oh!
And, to top it all off... she's in the shower!
You psycho-pervert, you!
Wh...What about you?! Look at what you're doing in my room, Ayukawa!
Oh! You're right...
My! Oh, gee! I'm so careless sometimes!
Oh! The bathtub!
Anyone in there?
Huh...? We're on the second floor!
There!
Yuusaku? Are you cold or something?
"Kasuga... I'm scared!"
Oh, n...
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Do you have any idea what they'll say about us?!
Move!
Move!
You see, like this...
See? There you go!
I've got no choice, I've got to teleport us...
Oh! I'm sorry!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
'Cause I love you...
A-HA-HA
And, today is that day, but... I doubt that he'll be coming.
The opponent is still smiling!
My! You're studying?!
Six years ago, eh? Get a hold of yourself!
Huh? This park can't be the...
N... No way...
Oh, sorry about that.
Yes!
Who... Who was it exactly?!
What?!
But... you told us you wouldn't be going to America, and that...
...you'd be attending senior high school with Darling and everybody else!
Hikaru...
A-ha! That's neat!
There!
Why, you rat...!
"...you might not be able to return to the present!"
Yeah. Sorry they aren't new any more, but I loved them...
How dare you touch 'em, you two!
Drool!
You twerp... Eat this!
D...Did you see that?!
A-ha... So that's your type, eh, oniichan?
What?! Your sister? I... It can't be...
I'm the little sister of the girl you called "Ayukawa."
A nice guy like you won't have much trouble finding a girl, oniichan.
...now that I'm ready to take the fall, it seems like a long way!
I can't go back to where I came from anyway!
Wow, oniichan!
"Hikaru's Magic Time!"
"Keep it! It looks pretty good on you."
...the "past" for Ayukawa and everybody else must've changed a lot.
Kasuga...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
At the moment, I'm faced with... an emotional dilemma...
The color of my manicure, as it dries...
You'll catch a cold if you take a nap there!
I was thinking that this is just like that day, long ago.
Oh! I know! Lemme guess... Your first love!
H...Hikaru! Wh...What did you just say?!
Oh? Oh, gosh, Darling!
Kyosuke, why don't you come and play with me?
You're in there, aren't you? I'm coming in.
I knew you'd come for me...
Has she really fallen for that guy...?
Stop crying! But...
What?! Papa's what?!
But... you told us you wouldn't be going to America, and that...
...so there I was, wandering aimlessly...
A-ha! That's neat!
Like this tree here.
Yeah. Sorry they aren't new any more, but I loved them...
Guess what I've found here... a hole!
Huh?
"Don't you have any friends?"
Pervert! D...Don't tell me... you're... a girl?!
Huh? W...Well, y'know...
...I "timeslipped" after falling down the stairs at school.
Madoka's... Madoka's...
All right! We've caught an alien!
I had no idea that I was...
Yeah! I promise! In six years... right here!

Thanks, oniichan.
What're you talking about?!
Elopement?
Kurumi! Manami!
Yes?
Umao! And, wherefore art thou, Umao?
What I've told you is all true!
No "Mr." or anything? You don't know me!
Dunkin'...
Ayukawa!
Huh?! W... Er... I was, er...
What?!
...for the sake of a certain someone.
Kasuga...
Okeydokey...
You're napping away, and it's only noon!
"That's why it's called a noontime nap?"
And, Ayukawa, he still...
...with Ayukawa Madoka... had, for the second time...
You've broken my heart.
A-HA-HA... I'm the actress in the mirror.
I wish I could bring myself to cry, but I change what I say to fit my tough act.
I just dance in the sweet memories The pain I suffered...
If you wanted to get in the bath with me, you shoulda just said so, Darling!
So how's our hot spring? Warms you right to the bone, doesn't it?
Lift? You don't need one of those.
None of the locals go skiing there...
We can't go skiing with the ones we love?
Kasuga... what's this superstition?
Here!
But it makes you worry a bit, huh...
Right! And naked too!
Hold it, Yuusaku! What do you think you're doing?
Looks like there's no need to worry about that...
Look at him ski!
Nothing...
It's hot...
"Hurry up. Take it off."
"C'mon..."
"If you won't take off your clothes, I'll take them off for you."
"Hey! Uh, hold it, Ayukawa!"
The ghosts gave me a vision!
Ushiko!
Ayukawa, you're really a sucker for these stories just like Hikaru said, huh?
It was there that the two made a pact.
Corpses? h
They're closing in! rGreenRun!
The ghost! So the story in that song really is true!
Separate! Let go! And then fall into the abyss!
So... let go... Let go!
But I'm not going to let go of Ayukawa's hand!
Ayukawa! I...
Thank you...
"And into an abyss did they fall..."
"l just dance in the sweet memories" ...has taught me how to love.
He's my one and only; you never can tell
Usually, I spend precious nights sitting beside you as you drive along.
Your cancellation call smelled of a lie. I hung up, pretending not to notice.
I wish I could bring myself to cry, but I change what I say to fit my tough act.
'Cause I love you... I'm the actress in the mirror.
We were greeting our second morning here. It was heaven, a true paradise.
...on that morning when we've become lovers.
That's great, but you want something to drink? I'm dying of thirst.
Great idea! What about you, Madoka?
Oh, so did I! I'll go get them, Kyosuke.
Hmm? What's wrong?
What? Oh, nothing...
So soft...
...making me feel a happy vertigo...
Hey, don't you think Hikaru's late? It's been 30 minutes already.
For us to put all our money in a bag and follow their instructions...
But why Hikaru?
"We can't! If we report this, Hikaru's life might be at risk..."
"That has to be it."
Wh... What is it, Ayukawa?
Let's go. rWhiteB... But this is America, right? What do we do if they point a gun at us?
I'm going to cast a spell. Go on, close your eyes.
No... No way! rWhiteVoil!
You see, the ancestors of the Kasuga family were all Ninja.
Is someone there?
That voice... I've heard it somewhere before...
Isn't that by Abe?
Hi... Hikaru!
That's right. I'm just a normal girl.
Give it to me! h
...a happy one, like seeing your photograph.
...because lovers' hearts are whimsical indeed.
That's right. If you play with this without knowing what it is...
...terrible things will happen.
I'M Kurumi!
Huh? What the? I've become Grandpa!
Now you see the power of the magic rope, hmm?
That's not the issue here! Besides, I have to get going now. See ya.
Geez! Our precious youth is flipping past us, page by page!
...where this guy who disliked the human world got turned into a fish...
...and everyone looks like they're having fun...
Huh?
You're right. It can't decide which way to go... that's just like Kasuga.
He's just like Darling because the way he runs away is so cute!
Uh-oh!
Got you now!
Ick!
But, I DID get caught by Ayukawa, so it's not all bad!
...a "goldfish scoop" guy around here selling our red-goldfish brother...? What? rGreenWhat?
Why don't you call him later and ask how he's doing?
That's the last of the goldfish we caught, too...
What's going on, Hikaru?
First a goldfish, then a cat? How unlucky can you get?
Oh! Looks like he's waking up.
Don't say that; give it back! rWhiteNo!
Thanks!
But, at that moment, Ayukawa really did seem sad...
Hey, Kitty, wanna take a bath with me?
Kitty...?
Ayukawa must've fallen asleep with the switch on...
A... Ayukawa's talking about me in her sleep...
Kyosuke!
What're you doing, you pervert?!
Even though I knew, I said nothing because I prefer harmony.
The sunrise brings back memories, and this feeling of love...
...we cannot keep ourselves apart.
H... H... Hikaru! Th... this isn't right! We're still in high school!
Long time no see, Kyosuke. You're looking all right.
It's summer vacation!
The pool?! A... Akane!
That's what Hikaru said to me.
Just a minute, Kyosuke. What's going on here?
Come on! Come on, Kyosuke! Say something, will you!
..."just" went and made a tennis date, is that right?
Hel-lo!
Huh? What?
Pretty hot, aren't you! h
The way things are going, I've got to head off Ayukawa...
Huh? Wait, what do you mean by that?
...this just isn't something a normal human being would do!
How do you do! I'm Kyosuke's cousin. My name's Akane.
...but THIS is why?
Hey, Akane!
Kasuga!
Okay!
Damn you, Akane!
Madoka, sweetie!
Uh-oh. I think maybe I overdid it.
Hey, hey! We just thought you were lonely, two girls sitting all alone...
Now, now. Don't be so mean. We're both lonely.

Stage of Love  Heart on Fire! SPRING IS FOR IDOLS!
"I'm glad you're there. How're the studies going?"
"Say what?!"
I don't belong to you alone. You're looking for pure love? Don't make me laugh!
There is more joy and pain in me than I can hold...
Huh? A... Ayukawa...!
So before I fall in love with you, let me put on my act.
The Hayakawa Mitsuru event that's coming to town, right?
So I'm the pinch hitter!
Sometimes I wish I could be an idol star, just once.
Lemme go! Lemme go! What if some tabloid reporter sees us!
Come on! It's an open secret that we're a couple!
Well, I'm so happy then!
...th... the one and only...
Darling, thanks for treating me to a wonderful dinner tonight!
"Kazuto!"
It's my treat this time around.
Could it be that my wish to become a normal guy again...
I see. So you're offering to be my knight in shining armor, is that it?
Hmmm...
"Talk about selfish motives!"
Well! This Hayakawa Mitsuru's got a few points on the plus side after all!
Gee, you seem to be pretty good at it.
Not you, Hayakawa Mitsuru.
Don't cry. h
Don't cry. rWhiteBut...
Wait! Ayukawa!
It's her, isn't it? You're concerned about her, I can tell...
And hold tight to the me that no one knows...
What do you mean,"Nothing at all?"
Look, audiences get to be on TV too.
Let's go check!
Huh?
What are you doing, you pervert?
Yesterday?
...on a national network! rWhiteA national network?!
I'll bring it right back!
Darling!
I don't think you have time to change into your stage outfit, Ayukawa.
There is more joy and pain in me than I can hold...
Don't you think she sings better than Mitsuru?
...the moment you've all been waiting for: Hayakawa Mitsuru will sing for us.
Huh?
Could he be talking about us, Kasuga?
What?
But from now on, I want to sing to all of you, as a real professional singer.
Me too.
Hurrah! Hayakawa Mitsuru!
Hey, Shuu!
What was that about Madoka, Darling?
"What is it?"
"Well, when I went to my boyfriend's house a few days ago..."
Don't say that. Please, please do it.
So you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, right? rGreenUh-huh.
Height and leg length also average.
But just seeing him isn't convincing. Right?
Darling!
Put on some suntan oil, get a good tan, get some good pictures...
Lonely and naive boyfriend...
...blue boyfriend...
Hey!
Making like you're in high spirits, boyfriend...
I know Akane's only acting, but it's getting pretty intense...
Wh... What's this?
Ready, Kyosuke? Here we go. rWhiteUh, right.
Your wallet?
Man, be more careful, okay? By the way, did something happen to Hikaru?
H... Hey! What's that supposed to mean? h
How about Twister? That's a little bit dirty...
Too easy!
Yes! He said I was a nuisance.
Me too...
Are you... serious?
A... Akane... Hey!
Hey, you!
Huh?
Could... that be...
Me, too...
As it happened...
Which one do you like?
Oh, your yesterdays... you can't return to those days again.
So how are you? Have you found yourself a love by now?
...Ayukawa's father has returned to Japan after a long time...
Hey, you fine-lookin' ladies, how about a dinner date with us guys!
Or we could avoid all that extraneous stuff and go straight to a hotel!
With me being over here, I'm so worried about him!
I guess Madoka will say yet again that we're all kissy-kissy...
We had a date, but he didn't come to the concert!
We'll be out for just a little bit, okay?
I just couldn't get another ticket this time around, okay?
Oh... Oh, it's only you guys!
Here's the chance for us to bring in all the girls we'll pick up!
Yeah. They asked if she stopped by here, but...
Yeah, there might be some news at Kasuga's place.
Please!
Oh. Then I must've come at a dangerous time!
Well... then, by all means, please do!
...I get a very happy feeling, somehow.
It's my mom's recipe.
About me staying over.
Y... Yeah...
Let's go to bed! h
Let's go to bed! rWhiteWhat?
Here.
Am I stupid or what?!
Just the two of us, all by ourselves.
Sleeping alone feels lonely?! You mean, in other words...!
What the? B... Brandy!
...you're not your usual self, somehow...
Ayukawa...
See, we didn't know what all had happened...
...who's the first-chair violinist for Madoka's father...
Ayukawa!
You got a crooked eyelash.
Huh?
I'll walk you all the way back to your house.
G... Good night!
...because I wanted to go look for Madoka with you!
How do you know?
It's Dad's curry and rice! Are you gonna eat, or what?

...with lipstick, on the bathroom mirror:
That's true, but...
Aren't freebies great, Darling?
Darling... please make real sure you come see the play!
What's that?
Oh...!
...but please drop by once in a while to cheer me on.
Ayukawa...
Yeah... It might be a good place...

'Cause Darling really loves sweet things!
Dad's out right now, so... if you get him too excited...
Sure!
Yeah...
If I could be held by you...
...but I want to try living intensely.
accounted for 40 of last year's exam...
What? Yeah... Sort of a cease-fire from my studies, you might say...
What? Did Hikaru tell you something?
Would you like some fries with that?
Really? That's great!
Madoka always starts knitting something around this time of year.
Yeah...! Can we go to the festival together, Darling?
It's so much work!
Yeah, right...
Is that everything Mom wanted me to send to her?
Sure.
and immediately you're snoring!
Wherewherewhere?
"If you want to have a telephone date with Saori..."
Idiots. That one's from last year.
That's right, but...
Hey! I already said that!
Hey! Don't touch!
Yo, "Dad!" You're gonna be going to take pictures of the fireworks, right?
Uh, yeah...
Bye...
Does it look good?
How untrustworthy those words are.
I mean, I... just couldn't keep my mind on my studies...
And somehow... I really didn't feel like going...
...love Ayukawa...
No... No... It's not possible.
Why...?
"Why? Why are you treating me like I'm an outcast?"
Chapter III
We'll have to settle all of this pretty soon, won't we?
Don't phone me anymore, okay...?
What are you doing here?
But I can't just let go...!
Hikaru... I guess it really can't be the three of us anymore...
The downfall of the Kamakura Shogunate. rWhite1333.
Which came first, the Koan or Bun'ei War? rWhite Koan.
Koan.

Kyosuke! Kyosuke!
Telephone... For... You!
What are you thinking, coming here this late at night?
At no time does time wait for me.
"Seven... maybe eight years ago...? She had the mumps. Looks pretty bad, huh?"
...I looked up at the sky...
It passes me by like the clouds...
...I will hold it in my heart.
Yeah...
That's terrific...
Really, it's a big deal...
Oh, so that's what Kurumi and Manami were fussing about...
You're talking about next year, and auditions have already started?
And before the final cast decisions, there'll be a series of tests...
Sheesh! That's just like the college entrance process...
Ayukawa...
Oh yeah... I gotta put this up...
I wonder if there aren't some more exciting guys somewhere...
Oh, you going out too, Jingoro? You must be hot in all that fur...
There you go.
You're so bashful, you know...
Really? That's great...
'Cause I'm younger, you know, and just like ABCB's Master was saying...
...I am a bird that keeps chasing a dream.
What's wrong, Ayukawa...?
Do you like this color?
So anyway, how's the play going?
It's so much work!
Is that everything Mom wanted me to send to her?
Mom and Dad are pretty busy with the tour and all...
Well... I guess it's goodbye for another few days... I don't want to be apart...
What...?
Of course! Of course!
Will you two cut it out?! I've never...
Next, I'll explain how to work out problem 3.
But he took these just a little while ago, and they're already finished...
I guess those needles are a bit slippery.
Oh, can I start on the oranges?
You're making it sound like I'm stupid or something!
Yeah... I suppose so...
Kasuga...!
On a terrace in the afternoon light...
...are melting in the ice tea too.
You whispered it just last night.
Hello...?
Hello? Ayukawa?
And so...
...and maybe what happened with Hikaru...
I... Ayukawa, I've...
Ayukawa...
It just can't go on like this, so... I thought I had better make things clear...
Yes, sir!
Hiyama! How do you expect to get the part if you can't memorize your lines?!
Oh, then Kasuga... good luck in your studies! I'll call again!
Ayukawa...
But I...
And you're listening to "Kawai Yoko's Midnight Talk!"
And so, I was given them, and...
'Cause... every day, whenever anything happens...
And second semester starts next week...
Madoka, what have you ever done for him?!
Why do you have to think like that?
And we'll always be together from now on, too. That's how it should be...!
The downfall of the Kamakura Shogunate. rWhite1333.
Hikaru, where are you going?
When I fell in love...
...and shine in blue.
Hold Me Again.
Huh? Yeah...!
...even though I call for it to stop.
...while stealing...
at both times in my life
I had an accident...
I was very insecure, worse than you.
It was the first time I saw you looking puzzled.
And it was the first time for us to be together.
Are you saying you're me?
Kasuga, you don't really understand,
Yes, of course!
I felt a pain in the bottom of my heart.
I... I can do anything for him.
Not me? I'm not the one for you?
Please, please look at me.
I'm sure it was good for Hikaru to move to a new place.
Do you remember the time when she was chosen
Good story, isn't it?
Where am I? What is this place?
Surgery in Progress
Have you slept with Kyosuke, or just kissed?
but you don't need to worry, it's very simple.
I didn't know what was going on.
Well, I wondering if the master was here?
The master went to play pachinko.
Pachinko?
It was like I didn't even know if I was alive or dead.
By the way, why are you here when you're supposed to be in New York?
What the hell am I saying?!
I came to this town because my mother asked me to.
Me too.
I said, "me, too," but I had no idea where to go.
What's the matter?
No!
However, even though I was thinking about her like that,
I... I might disappear at anytime.
Ayukawa...
If so, if that's true, I... I...
By the way, have you written me a song yet?
I don't think it's necessary to understand.
You can tell because you're an idol star, can't you?
In Bosnia the search continues for a missing Japanese student,
No way!
Nothing, never mind, never mind.
Otherwise, I don't understand why Kyosuke is missing in Bosnia.
Let's make love
Cause I'm all alone
We have each other
And I believe we have the power
Oh, I know her!
100!
Madoka!
Well?
Yes, it is.
No, not really.
Can I ask you one thing?
Well, it's...
You and Madoka are both adults,
Yes, that's right. Let's have a party!
You want water? Sure, I'll bring it for you.
Excuse me, but can you cancel the taxi?
and replies that never say anything.
Just kidding!
Hikaru...
But talking in your sleep like that
Yes?
I've really wanted to see you, Hikaru.
I love him!
You've grown up a lot.
I wanted to be mature enough before I saw you.
Really? But you're younger than me now.
Grandpa!
Okay, I'm old, but I'm going to use all of my power.
it was going to be the first time, so I was very nervous.
I don't think there's any other way to sleep.
Hey, Kyosuke!
Hikaru, what happened between you and Mr. Sugisawa?
Hurry up! He already came through the gate!
I wonder if that's possible?
She's a good girl.
The morning of that day, when you get hit by a car, call yourself.
I understand. Okay, I will.
That time?
Pressure? What do you mean?
Excuse me, but you look so perfect in that mini-skirt.
Oh no, you forgot!
No, no! You ought to dry yourself off.
I wonder if I will give birth to an ESPer?
Ayukawa?!
Idiot!
I feel like I'm a cave man.
those are very important to me, and I've protected them, but...
Kokoro ni Kiss shite, iron na yume mite, DAY DREAM, MY DREAM
Your eyes were shaking faintly.
I was very insecure, worse than you.
Really?
Yes, of course!
"Master, I'm sorry I didn't get to say good bye to you," she said.
Oops!
Hikaru was like a younger sister to Ayukawa.
I can't give you up, Kasuga.
She said she doesn't know how much she can do, but she'll try.
Geez, I'll be late for school!
Kyosuke! Watch out for the car!
Kyosuke! Kyosuke!
Yamamoto
Oh, yeah, I think I heard that from the Master of Abcb.
You called him and said you were going to go to New York
Excuse me, but do you know when it was?
Oh no, Mr. Sugisawa, you said too many things at once.
I haven't got a part yet.
You're so funny!
No!
Kasuga was only 22 years old.
Idiot! She's so gorgeous. Men won't leave her alone!
Madoka, I'm not saying I don't understand you,
However, even if people call you the "Cinderella Girl",
There she goes.
The melody is a little rough, but it's filled with your passion,
What?
You can tell because you're an idol star, can't you?
I can write lyrics for that song.
the ghost of Kyosuke Kasuga.
Ayukawa!
Anyway, I hadn't disappeared yet.
No way... Oh no, Kasuga!
Do you know him? That story's big news all over Japan.
and he was thrown to a different place in the time dimension.
What do you mean?
it might have crashed into Kyosuke from this time,
Oh, no...
In bed
Now that we have come to be scared of living
Cause I'm all alone
Hi, Ayukawa is not able to take your call.
You made a mistake, didn't you?
Well, I have a good idea.
One, two, three...
Well, Kasuga, why you are running away from Madoka
Oh, my God, what will I do
Sorry, I've been drinking and wanted to hear your voice.
Why don't you call somebody else?
Well, she was with a gentleman.
No, that's all right.
Kasuga, Kasuga! Hang on, please!
Can't do this. You can't do this, Kyosuke.
and replies that never say anything.
Yes?
Don't worry.
Well...
We didn't do anything! It's true! We...
Welcome home.
I still love Kasuga.
You can say what you want.
even though I was an infamous bad girl years ago?
You've grown up a lot.

Hey, little boy!
Time for bed, in other words...
Hikaru, what happened between you and Mr. Sugisawa?
I see, I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm sure of it!
Well, neither of us succeeded this time.
Really? But what about Ayukawa?
What do you mean?
Hey, it was all your fault, Kyosuke from three years ago.
Well, when did you start calling her Madoka instead of Ayukawa?
See, there you go again. When you went to Bosnia, you said "nothing".
Excuse me, but you look so perfect in that mini-skirt.
I don't care if someone sees me.
What is?
It's safe without it tonight.
I just wondered
I just wondered. I can't believe your reaction, pervert!
Of course, you know, your identity and your feelings
I love you and I really, really want you like this!

It was the first time...
Be careful with a car...
Huh??
Yeah!
Yeah!
It's delicious...
Stop it, Darling...
If it's for senpai, I can do anything!
That was because the three of us were becoming adults.
Please, please take a good look at me.

And I was asked to come to the musical, no matter what...
Nice story, isn't it?
Just go!

Kasuga-kun!

An overpass, here?

Madoka-san!
Wow, no way! Is that you, Kasuga-senpai?
The Master of ABCB mentioned your phone call.
What? The Master?
Go ahead, go ahead...
Maybe she's talking with a guy.
This isn't an English class.
Um, Kasuga-senpai...
What are you thinking, Kyosuke?
Senpai has always done some pretty weird stuff sometimes.
Well, things don't seem to be too good, not now.
It's too soon...
K-Komatsu...
Mr. Hatta Kazuya, will now begin his autograph session.
That car is...
Hiyakawa Mitsuru?!
What?
You're wrong about that...
Hi! Aloha Madoka-chan!
That's right, that's right! How are you doing?
I just heard the news about Kyosuke's disappearance.
What do you mean?!
But don't worry...
I hope to be together in our dream.
Yes! Ayukawa isn't home right now.
That can't be...
99!
People usually avoid these long stairs, even though they have to take a detour.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Room number 1205...
I don't think Hikaru-chan is a virgin anymore.
5:39 PM
This is my 7th time seeing it...
Hikaru is...
Unfortunately, Miss Hiyama is not in her room right now.
A little while ago, she came back with her companion...
Um, companion? What companion?
Um, hello?
Hikaru is together with some guy.
I'm sorry, but can you cancel the taxi?
Well, it's not a matter of it being a loss.''
Yes, I'll be right there.
Welcome home...
I wanted to see you, Hikaru.
...strongly connected to each other...
I like him!
That is why last night was so intense.
Hikaru...
Yes?
Here I go!
...but you cannot see it because it is a scolding afternoon.
...only your heart is really close to us.
Me?
Stupid!
Tell me that's not true!
But please, please awaken Kyosuke!
If I worry too much when I am young, as a grandma, they say it's big trouble.''
The 22 year old Ayukawa Madoka is just what a woman should be.
A-Ayukawa...
But I... This is the first time for me...
Well, er... I mean...
I shouldn't have done that, huh?
Did something happened?
I don't know...
But the next time I return, it'll be nice to have media coverage like that.
He's sending me, the 19 year old Kyosuke, a substantial amount of intense power.
Summer vacation will start soon...
And as I looked through the viewfinder, I wanted to follow all the way.
Well, I... don't know.
Hey, Kyosuke from 3 years ago...
It's your fault!
Wait, wait, it's your fault too!
That's it!
How about that?
Eh?
I knew what it was going to be...
The light stand...
Fool...
...I would give birth to an ESPer.
Oh...
Ma-Madoka...

I'm you, Kasuga Kyosuke!
What kind of joke is this?
That stupid guy! I was having a good dream about Ayukawa!
You know, a celebration...
It's delicious...
Still too sweet?
I can't give up Kasuga-senpai.
I wasn't ignoring you...
The musical inspired her.
After graduating from high school in Otaru...
Just go!
At that time, I've completely forgot about this morning's phone call.
Where...
Kasuga-kun!
Why am I here?
I don't know where his soul went, but there's no need to worry.
If he can get the power from him, he can come back here.
I was only thinking about how I could get back to my time.
Summer
No way!
No, no... Where did I move to?
Afterwards, ABCB sold everything, including the name and the property rights.
We haven't seen each other for 3 years.
Now that I think about it, Hikaru-chan is older than me.
It's going to be something big.
Stop it, senpai...
Yeah, me too...
Is everything okay?
I can't ask her such things.
Komatsu...
...even if Ayukawa was with another guy.
Does he mean me?
You always say that you don't know anything about this business, Madoka.
What?
What do you think? I could add lyrics to this song.
I can't take it...
Something has certainly happened to me in this time period.
...and she was a ghost, I would wish to see her.
Ayukawa!
Kyosuke...
I wanted to run to Ayukawa's place as soon as possible.
You must be having a hard time dealing with all that has been happening.
My theory is...
...and we enjoy to have many stories till sunrise...
This lovin' I have for you, it's never changin'.
What am I saying...
People usually go out of their way to avoid these stairs.
Is there any reason for that?
B...Because...
Hikaru-chan seemed to be used to this kind of thing.
Madoka-san, how are you doing?
Yes?
Hey!
N...No...
Gentleman?
Huh?
Senpai!
Here, senpai... Here's the water.
The taxi you requested is here...
...it is your way of replying.
...it was snowing outside.
What's wrong?
Do you remember what happened last night?
If a beautiful woman hated you for what you said in your sleep, what would you do?
Well, er...
Yes, I'll be right there.
Well, because...
We just met on the street.
Yeah...
You really did it this time!
You've really grown up, Hikaru.
...but you cannot see it because it is a scalding afternoon.
Your favorite evening clothes are melting to your skin...
Don't be afraid...
Stupid!
Say, Kyosuke-kun...
It's a place where no one will force him to do anything, nor keep him busy.
T...Then, does that mean he'll sleep there forever?
I...
This just in!
If I worry too much when I am young, I'll be in trouble as a grandma.
Well, um...
The 22 year old Ayukawa Madoka was the perfect woman.
There's only one person I need to remember.
Ayukawa is being held by a man bigger than me.
She will!
W...What might've?
Hey, Kyosuke from 3 years ago...
Kyosuke, when you return to the past, there's something you must do.
You have to call yourself on the morning you get into the accident.
Well, you'll probably need to get grandfather to help you to do it...
Oh, that...
Go back...
All right, let's begin!
Hey, do you know how much you made Madoka worry?''
Geez!
You shouldn't do that since you're wearing a mini-skirt.
I mind though...
Eh?
Summer
The light stand...
No, no... I won't.
I've wanted you so much, I...

She's always busy with work.
Ayukawas sister got married.

But...
But then, none ofyou wouId for give her if she did, right ?
Besides, dont we wantto hoId a good-bye party ?

Since the day I began to forget the tenderness you gave me...
You guys are dead !
Right, Hatta ?

And a common mistake in this Iine is the direction ofthe inequaIity.
Thats about it.
Theres no teIIing how Iong Hikarus whim wiII continue, though.

You Iook mature enough without anything fancy.
No, I haveto get going.
Going somewhere ?
Kurumi, Im sorry.Im sorry.
Kyosuke, did something happen to Kurumi at schooI ?
He doesnt Iike it.
But, Madoka is abit too big up top.
She must have gotten new stimuIation from a man.
Midnight girI of soIitude...
Hikarus energy andthe musics energy mixed.
I sing because Im Ionesome.
Breaking heart, hoId me.HoId me tight.
I couIdnt do anything.

If I take out the tabIes theres enough space for a party with 20 peopIe.
Why did Ayukawa...?
But thats thefirst time...
...Ive everseen you Iie.

I thought itd be moreartistic upside-down.
What is it ?
I understand.
Both are the best !
Thats...
You saw it ?
Lets expIore the universe !
Can we keep this asecret just between us ?
Senpai !Whatre you doing ?!

So, I ended up here.
But a swim beforegoing to the Iibrary...
DarIing.

WHATRE YOU TRYINGTO DO TO KURUMI !!
How was it ?How did Kurumi feeI ?
That great ?
Cant you come up with a better description ?
What was so great, Hatta ?
Are you okay, DarIing ?
Manami, youre so cute. I feeI Iike poking you.
I was in the back section.
I have to work at the Abcb.
But I wonderwhere DarIing went ?

You two !!
Swim ! Right Papa ?
I think there might be something on the other side !
Oh yeah !
When we started at the Abcb...

Nobody said I was a boy.

This is the oneIve aIways wanted !
Keep it !It Iooks good on you !
Id never have guessed that I was the one who bought her the hat.
PIease stop crying.
He sent Ayukawa here ?!
HeIIo !
I had to go to America...
...just feII in Iove with a man who happens to be an ESPer.
Kasuga, its funny that youre crying, whiIe a normaI person Iike me isnt.
Okay, III go buy something.Wait here !
Cause he said he Iikes girIs with beautifuI, Iong hair.
See ya !
Ifyou dont want to return, I can Ieave you two here.
And a person who stiIIIoves you very much.
60, 61, 62, 63, 64...
88, 89, 90...
Whew... it's hot!
That makes it just about a hundred steps in all.
A straw hat, huh?
The wind stole it from me.
91, 92, 93, 94, 95...
No way! There should only be 99 steps!
Yeah right! Maybe it was you who counted wrong!
100!
Keep it! rWhiteHuh?
That's more like it!
I'm home!
Yup!
Of course! Kyosuke is absolutely right.
The Power... must not be used in public!
No way! That's some fetish!
Wherefore art thou, Ushiko...?
Right...? rGreenWell...?
Never mind what happened yesterday...
Couldn't help it... in such a situation!
You've gotta be kidding me! Go look in a mirror!
Oh! I see a seat that isn't taken.
By the way...
What the?! What're you doing?! h
These photos are rare items!
Cleaning...?!
O...Oh, no!
How about it... You wanna be my bitch?
Hikaru, stand back!
If you start to smoke at a young age...
The girl who gave me this hat was...
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
But in my case, that's literally what happened...
As one encounter led to a double romance...
I've fallen in love with you - that I realized...
Never mind that! Help me with this...
Huh? Forget about it. This kinda thing has nothing to do with you, Oniichan.
Kurumi... lying is a bad thing!
Uh-oh!
What're you doing, if I may ask?
W...What about Ayukawa's score?
...can you believe that?!
Show me what you've got!
Fine! I'll show ya...
...or so I said, but...
Huh?
Man, am I beat!
Oh!
Of course! If I use the Power without anyone noticing...
Oh? It's the brother of those bratty twins!
...I mean, their bento...
All right!
Hold it! Hold it, you!
I won't! No way!
Oh! Er... well... you see...
"Darling?!"
"Darling..." she said?! Why, you!
Besides, Kasuga is new to our school.
If you label her like that... it wouldn't be fair.
Oh, nothing!
...if I just reach out with all my might...
Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment.
...am living the best years of my youth!
...sayin' "Take me anywhere, Just go!"
...the way you avoided me, usin' that naive look, wasn't so innocent.
"Take me to Summer Side"
Yo, Kasuga!
Well, at any rate... Come hang out with us for a bit.
Oh!
See? Isn't that great?
Besides, how can you say "No" to "Cheek Time...?"
They're still kids... And they're not ready for discos. Not yet, at least.
Sheesh... Listen, you're not to go there ever again!
Hey! Wake up, Oniichan!
Welcome.
No way! No way! This can't be happening!
Huh? Oh! Er... well, I didn't intend to...
...and what Hikaru asked me at that moment...
What's taking Kasuga and the gang so long?!
"Yeah?! Lucky me! Happy me!"
This sucks! He promised to meet us here!
Why, you...!
Ayukawa! I'll be right there!
Kurumi's in heaven!
Excuse me, another mixed pizza...!
...so maybe I was trying my best to catch up to her...
Oh, shoot! My date with Hikaru!
Um... um... well...
I'll take care of this. See ya.
Strange kid...
Someday... Someday... Please let my body feel your lips...
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
As one encounter led to a double romance...
...three beating hearts...
Jingoro... water... water...
H...Hikaru!
I'm sorry... the reason why... I stood you up was... because...
...and late at night, to boot!
Your coffee is gonna get cold. How many sugars do you take?
Ugh! Naughty!
Oh, c'mon, Kurumi, you're lying!
Yeah, me too...
No... No way!
Hey, did you hear? Some freshman named Hikaru slept with Kasuga!
No way!
You could've let me know about this earlier!
I, for one, believe that Jr. High students shouldn't be doing such things.
I didn't get to "C" with Hikaru, I'm telling you!
Oh...
The reason why he stood me up wasn't because he didn't like me.
Do you believe what he told you?
I understand. Then, hang in there, Hikaru. I wish you the best.
Sure!
So you don't like me after all, Sempai...?
H...Hold on!
How could I not like someone as cute as you?
Sempai...
Oh, c'mon!
"Excuses..."
Wh...Why do you ask, all of a sudden?!
Like, one time... It was when I was really little...
In the end, Madoka's persistence won out, and the boy gave up.
I can't see the movie very well...
Hold it, you!
YES!
We ain't through with you yet!
You've got some nerve, girl!
You dumb bitch!
What?!
...three beating hearts...
That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'...
...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe.
You slammed the door, evadin' the shadows that followed...
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
Ushiko! Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?
No, no! Keep running!
...and besides, I have to go away to Karuizawa for the holidays!
Hikaru... It's okay... now will you please tell me what happened?
Ayukawa... Ayukawa, of all people...
S...S...Sure!
Jingoro!
I'm home...
Perhaps he's got beriberi...?
...though, actually I wanted to sleep all day!
All right...
"What do you want?!"
"Oh!"
Watch where you're looking!
"...verts..."
Thanks to you, I'm saved.
Oh, Master...! I'd like it if you did, too!
Oh... if... if it's too small, then there's another one a size bigger, so...
Maybe I can pull this off, eh?
"Hey, hey... Just between us, okay, but... Kasuga and Ayukawa are..."
Uh-huh!
Me too, a "soda au crme!"
Oh, man...
But, the break was over before I realized it...
That's not true!
After all, you were supposed to go out on a date with Hikaru...
What?!
Kurumi!
...and makes you crazy about me.
...played gentle melodies.
...am living the best years of my youth!
Sayin' that you desire tenderness over a caress...
"Koryo Sr.  Jr. High Schools - First Semester Midterm Exam Schedule"
Oh, what is it, Oniitama?
Sheesh! Ayukawa thinks she's cool or something!
What?! This too?! But we studied this in grammar school!
I bet that I'd do really well on the exam, if you do!
Huh? resume
It couldn't have... been that kid again!
"Part-Time Work!"
Now I can memorize the words wherever I go!
That's right! Studying is so much fun!
I think that in studying for exams...
I get it! It's the wall socket!
I was just trying to make a joke!
Shit! I knew that guy would be here again!
When it comes to studying for exams, it's the quality, not the quantity that counts!
I'm back. Thanks for minding the store for me.
Oh...
Hikaru's so cute... trying to help a junior when she's only a freshman.
Uh... well, I mean... what I mean is...
I'm kinda in a hurry now, so... I'll see you later, okay?
Oh... after school? I've got a previous engagement...
Well, then, I'll see you.
Yeah. He, Hikaru and I, we all used to play together when we were little.
The three of us... we used to take baths together too.
Why should I be hiding anything from you, Ayukawa?
Ayukawa...
Yup. I just love their mannequin.
He didn't say he was studying for the exam, though.
Because of this and that, I couldn't study at all!
Whew... It's over at last!
Sensei! Help! The door won't open!
Oh, it's open now.
"I'll bet that you wouldn't like it, being a guy...
...that she ended up third overall!
"255: Kasuga Kyosuke" "256: Hatta. 257: Komatsu"
...what I wanted to tell you was that...
Oh well, anyway, Hikaru didn't find out about us...
I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15 years old...
You slammed the door, evadin' the shadows that followed...
I've fallen in love with you - that I realized...
Howdy! Is Kasuga-sempai around?
Huh?! Oh... You're talking about Hikaru?
Now that I think about it...
Er, say... you're not working at ABCB?
Hey, you two, are you or aren't you coming in? What's the deal?
Why you... Apologize to her!
What?
You gotta be kidding me, Ayukawa!
Look at yourself!
I bet you're looking down on me!
S...Sorry...
I don't believe any of the things they're saying about you!
Is this for real?!
Bow!
Kasuga! The bakery folks are here!
H...Hey! Hey! Wait a sec!
I...I believe he went up to the roof.
There!
Same here.
It's not that great of a thing after all.
Ayukawa!
Ah... I'm starving!
Darling?
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
...three beating hearts...
...am living the best years of my youth!
I've fallen in love with you - that I realized...
...the way you avoided me, usin' that naive look, wasn't so innocent.
You may get changed in that room over there.
But you're a landscape photographer.
Like this!
Want me to break a few of your teeth, so you can't ever laugh again?!
"It's really too bad, but next Sunday I'll be... working!"
"'Cause, I've been discovered by a photographer!"
"D...Discovered?!"
My goodness! What are you guys so excited about?
Haha! See, it all happened yesterday.
And, then, this cameraman said, "Oh, I've never seen..."
Hikaru's story began to...
The same Hikaru that's... usually quite bothersome...
What?! Today?! But, today is Sunday!
Komatsu and Hatta.
Huh? What? What the?! Oh, my!
Whoa! Stop! The shutter-cable...!
...at a time like this... feels awkward.
Oh! Look, the sea!
Kyosuke, shall we get going?
To be honest, I never expected...
Oh! I won't let you get away!
Oh!
Hatta! NOW!
I was very lucky to discover both her and Hikaru.
Here you go!
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
If something happens, she'll use the Power... and the crook will be TKO!
'Cuz! 'Cuz! I wanted to repaint the patterns in the room!
The Arabesque-patterned one.
Yeah!
On second thought... Maybe not.
Darling!
Oniichan, where are you?! Come over here, quick!
She disappeared while I was talking to a clerk about wallpaper...
So... the man who took Kurumi away... What was he like?
Manami, let's go look for her! You go with Kurumi!
D...Don't act innocent!
What?!
I haven't a clue...
Huh?
...I guess this is the kind of a place that he meant.
...when really, you just wanted to come in here on a date?
You're wrong! Let's go!
"Rather than sitting across a table from each other...
Though... somehow we seem to be going to a more remote area.
Huh?!
If there aren't many people, it's more dangerous, you see!
That was good! Did I eat or what?!
What are you doing? O... Oh! Nothing!
A nicer place?
Yup!
Come on now. We'd better go look for her as well.
Sheesh! After all the trouble I went through, we end up here!
It sure is quiet. This sunset... it's as if it's blessing both of us.
Kurumi!
She couldn't... possibly have been...
Jingoro... Jingoro...
Jingoro? Where are you?
Jingoro...
Huh? Hmm... If we stay here, she might happen by.
But, regardless... What WERE you thinking, going off with a guy?
It had been a long, busy day, full of all sorts of events.
Darling!
...and makes you crazy about me.
Love is deja vu; an unfamiliar memory. I feel our lips pressing together.
That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'...
"Take me to Summer Side"
"H... Hikaru!"
"Oh!"
Oniichan!
Oh?!
Uh-huh.
Oh, I just remembered! I have to review my stuff before class!
Later!
It's only morning still!
...something like that? Well?
...I felt that this was the first time I'd seen her do that... But, then...
S...Stop handling the ball like that! Oh, I'm feelin' good!
...for such a peppy girl as Hikaru to...
H...Hey! Stop!
Don't kill yourself so soon!
Wh... Why you!
You make it sound as if Hikaru is about to die or something!
Madoka!
"l knew that... I knew that you'd come for me!"
"Kyosuke..."
"Umao, wherefore art thou, Umao?!"
"Hikaru!"
That son-of-a-bitch...
Oh! Th...These new illnesses... Well...
"D...Don't! Anyway, I hear that this fortune-teller is usually right."
I can't believe that guy! "Hikaru this, Hikaru that!"
Anyway, let's get out of here!
Just Darling and I, together...
Hikaru!
"Hikaru!"
I see...
Hikaru... Without you, I...
"Night of Summer Side"
"A...Ayukawa?"
"Yes... That's right..."
...but also a window into a wider world.
Read the next paragraph, Kasuga!
...th...the TILES?
Oh, c'mon! What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?
It's Ayukawa we're talking about. We've nothing to worry about.
Good morning!
Me too! I wanna give this to Kurumi... All my lovin'! All of me!
So, I beg you! Please!
No way... A marriage?!
If you want to go to the bathroom, then do so! No need to hold it.
I'm especially proud of my creation for today!
Bummer! Sempai, let's go!
 ...from having made a move on another girl.
I couldn't do anything...
Oh! Oh...
Ayukawa, I've always... I've always...
Ayukawa!
She's busy with work, so she's not around the house often, you see.
This is what I get for jumping to conclusions too fast.
It turns out that Ayukawa's parents are internationally-famous musicians!
...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe.
...I learned that Ayukawa's parents are internationally-famous violinists.
And, well... she wanted to keep it a secret from you guys.
Darling, I don't want her to go! I don't want her to!
Morning!
"Yeah!"
"You bastard! What do you think you're doin'?!"
Yo! That doesn't mean that you can get friendly with her, got that!
R...Right, Hatta?
I brought my own lunch!
Yoo-hoo! And, so, every day from now on...
E...Every day?!
Okay, then! "For what we are about to receive!"
Oh! N...Nothing...
"But... you sure it's going to be all right?"
"Hard as it might be to believe, even I had a few love affairs before I got married."
Er...
What? You mean, maybe they wanted to get even?!
Sure!
...was for real.
...three beating hearts...
An encounter is like a highway junction...
"Night of Summer Side"
...and so... today is "Volunteer Day."
To thank the local community that is helping all of you...
...you should fully show your volunteer spirit!
Dummy! Your "volunteer" activities get noted in your student record.
H... Hey! Hey!
Er... How about your profile?
Wh...Which classroom are you in? What's your name?
Er... Your favorite color? What do you wear in bed?
I doubt that!
Hikaru, take my trash! Please, with all my love!
Why would Hikaru start looking all grown-up, all of a sudden...
...or so I began wondering...
But, I wonder what made Hikaru do it?
Wherefore art thou, Umao?
Ushiko!
Hm?!
Huh...? Holy cow!
Let's get outta here, eh?
Madoka, do you know where Sempai might be?
No...
Whoa!
Seeing the guys... flock around her more and more...
Right! Right!
They get stomach aches, huh?
Gotten anywhere?
Oh! It's for me?!
Huh?!
I doubt that that is the case.
No, I have to get going.
I can't believe it!
Papa!
Jingoro!
I, Hino Yuusaku... may not be very talented. However...
No can do! As a man, I, Hino Yuusaku...
I wonder who Hikaru is waiting for...
So, that's what happened!
Hikaru...
If you wanna be treated like a baby by someone...
Sempai!
You got me again, Ayukawa...
Besides, it's exhausting to dress up like a grown-up!
I'm sorry for making you help me out 'til closing.
...very cute.
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
Ayukawa leaves, saying, "A cowardly man like you is the worst!"
You slammed the door, evadin' the shadows that followed...
Oh... Ayukawa...!
Ushiko! Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?
"Ahh... Fine! Fine!"
"Yeah! Yippee!"
"Yeah! We did it!"
Ha! "As soon as they see the training..."
Dad, you're crazy!
To be blunt, I looked absolutely uncool.
It might not be possible to get together today.
What?!
Oh, golly... It's nothing...
Hikaru!
U... Uh-huh!
A-ha! I'm done writing! Done writing!
Th... That's going too far! Oh!
Hey, H... Hatta!
What?!
Right! Left! Right! Left!
"Don't overexert yourself!"
Uh-huh.
Come on.
The w... worst? Me?
FIGHT!
That new girl... Kinda light-weight, eh?
Oh! Why, thank you very much...
I said NO, and I meant it!
Oh, my love will ride the southern wind.
...my dream had nothing to do with anything.
Anyway... no need, 'cause... It's best the way it is now.
...because I was sleeping upside down...
...my foreboding dream played out exactly backwards.
But, Ayukawa lied, saying that she had to work at ABCB.
Next time: "Madoka's Ultimate Decision! Putting a Period to the Love Triangle"
...am living the best years of my youth!
That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'...
...by the time the seaport was in sight...
Ushiko...
Ushiko!
What do you think you're doing?! Okay, Kurumi, gimme back mine too!
...how can I put it...
Oh!
But, Darling said... Darling said...
What are you talking about?!
Maybe that's why he...
Madoka, you're the best!
Oh, I just remembered! I'm gonna go back to cleaning after all!
Me too!
B... But, I got SLAMMED right in my face!
Is there a problem?!
Let me see it.
Here...?!
Sure! Sure, a reception...
You're cruel!
You've got Hikaru to help you. So what's the problem?
Let us begin at once!
Hatta, let's sweat!
No problem!
Madoka's picture looks wonderful too!
Er, sorry... Wait a sec! YOU said that!
Oh? What's wrong? I'll be with you soon, so...
W... What's wrong?
You're lying!
When I did, Madoka said...
Beep!
A... Ayukawa...
Give a clear answer!
Which of the two... Hikaru or Ayukawa... is better?!
I cannot...
Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment.
"We are not alone."
"We are not the only ones in the universe..."
Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me!
I'm gonna save you no matter what!
Big Bro!
Big Bro!
Yeah.
Hurry back, okay?
See you later!
Oh man, perfect timing!
Tanjiro!
If you're done eating, go to bed. You can set off for home at first light.
That's why the demon hunters protect us by slaying them
my grandma used to say the same thing when she was still alive.
Nezuko...
I was saved by the snow.
Nezuko?
they were murdered brutally like that!
A sword?
That's how man-eating demons multiply.
You gotta be kidding.
Just now, you were about to be devoured.
Don't do it!
Don't kill my little sister!
Don't ever give others a chance to murder you!
Don't despair.
I know it's painful.
No!
Stop!
A straightforward attack driven solely by emotion...
Just before he hid behind the tree,
he hurled that rock toward me and, at the same time,
tossed the hatchet in the air.
He hid his hands as he pretended to attack
someone once said the same thing, only to be devoured by a demon.
When a demon is starving,
it will kill and devour even its own parents or siblings.
and she's expending energy to heal those injuries.
That means she's severely starved at this moment, without a doubt.
Your big brother is definitely gonna save you, you hear?
You know you can't walk as fast Tanjirou.
I promise I'll help you!
Yeah.
Thank you so much, Tanjirou.
Take's all red!
There, there.
i1the smell of blood.
Gosh, it's gotten dark already.
As they always have.
i1I'll bring my brothers and sisters next time.
i1it always carries...
i1Nezuko's the only one who's still warm!
i1I was saved by the snow.
You don't have to walk!
i1And there was another one...
Nezuko!
That's probably the one who killed my family!
I'll search for a way! I'll definitely find a solution.
i1Don't cry.
i1Where's his axe?
i1I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
Would it be okay if I took that basket, straw and some bamboo?
Nah, don't worry about it.
Can you fit inside?
Remember how your body grew bigger before?  omit "as big as an adult", it sounds dumb
Good job!
People have gone missing lately!
This mountain path is pretty rough! Someone's probably hurt!
Are you all right?
i1It's a man-eating demon!
The same trick won't work a second time.
i1Did his body just move without a head?
My hair got all tangled up while I was wrapping it around this axe!
i1I wonder if there's a lot of demons out there.
i1If I don't finish him off, he'll end up killing people again.
You won't be able to finish him off with that.
i1It'll be a painful death.
i1He's facing a demon, yet the scent of kindness remains.
i1His empathy extends even to a demon.
I'll fucking eat your guts.
I can't go to you, so you come to me!
Nezuko?
i1All your life...
This kimono's my favorite!
N-Now have I... passed the test?
Now find your way back to the house at the bottom of the mountain.
I... have... returned... split this into 3 lines please
i1Please do forgive my briskness,
i1I can sense something special about these two.
Next, Episode 3, "Sabito and Makomo"!
Their staple food are humans.
Some demons have special powers.
you must survive the Final Selection process held on Mt. Fujikasane.  Does "Final Selection" really need to be capitalized?
Whether or not you may participate in the Final Selection is up to me.
i1Today I did the usual while carrying a sword.
Nezuko...
i1Today, I did nothing but fall.
i1That is, I trained to fall properly and get up quickly in all situations.
Thats right.
Wrong!
i1Time and time again, I think Im about to die.
i1Am I hopeless?
A man shouldnt whine. Its unseemly.
Too immature.
You havent mastered a single thing!
Carve it into your flesh!
That was an amazing strike!
Who are you?
It, like, accelerates your blood flow, making your heart start racing.
At the end of the day, I dont think theres anything else you can do.
i1I would swing my sword.
i1But even with that...
i1When I challenged him that day,
After six whole months,
Hold this memory close to your heart.
Now, its time for a Taisho secret!
Next, Episode 4, Final Selection!
i1When Im fighting against someone,
i1and I pick up this scent, I can see this thread.
Master Urokodaki...
Thank you very much!
Ive imbued it with magic that protects the wearer from harm.
Everyone,
i1So, Ill have to head east!
i1I wonder if I can take them.
Shut up!
i1All that training wasnt for nothing!
i1not even the bones are left behind, huh?
A demons weak spot is its neck!
Whats this deformed demon doing here anyway?
i1Water Wheel!
Thirteen.
What are you talking about?
i1But I was with them!
All of his disciples wear them.
Its like Urodaki fed them to me!
When I told that to the girl, she started crying and fell into a rage.
Calm down, Tanjirou.
Your breathings uneven.
Another of Urokodakis brats is gonna die.
Oh man, I wish I could see it.
I really do.
i1My bodys crumbling away.
Hold my hand, will you?
i1Sabito, Makomo...
i1You can rest easy now.
Even if I survive now, Im gonna die in the end anyway.
Hinoe.
Tsuchinoe.
Who the hell cares about some stupid crow?
Nezuko!
Yes.
rather than by consuming flesh.
Im thirty-seven!
Here are your orders!
Its time for the next mission! Hurry up!
Hey, you there!
Tanjirou...
Even the claws and fangs of lesser demons cannot rend that uniform.A low-level demons talons or fangs cant even tear through that uniform.
I have faith that you can make that happen.
Right.
Could this be the town to the northwest?
I want you to believe me.
Thats why Ive come here, after all.
The scent just got stronger!
i1The Demon Slayers...
i1Theyre here!
Where are all the girls you kidnapped?
What was that?
Please take care of her and be on standby nearby.
i1Here he comes!
i1Eighth Form!
Fuck off, will ya?!
Well, Im not satisfied, my other self!
Satoko?
i1It may only help to console her,
i1Never forgive any demons
Nezuko!
i1The inside of a swamp...
Theres hardly any air inside this swamp.
i1Ive gotta get out of here, fast!
i1He mustve given her a huge amount of blood!
Start talking!
i1Im always watching you.
i1I couldnt get any answers once again.
Wait just a little longer, okay?
I promise Ill turn you back into a human again!
I hope youll find one of Satokos belongings in there.
i1Seeing his hand was heart-wrenching.
Just shut up and go already!
i1Its the same scent that lingered at my house!
Daddy?
i1Hes...
an8Its all right.
i1That hes a demon?
Do you know him?
I do not.
If I can take him down, I can turn Nezuko into a human again!
I heard he makes udon in Asakusa because he loves the place so much.
Are they drunk?Is it a drunk?
I cant!
Please stop!
What are all these patterns?
i1Is the scent growing stronger?
Im still concerned about that disturbance just now.
Now, get in.
As you wish.
Sorry for leaving you behind like that, Nezuko.Sorry about that, Nezuko. Leaving you behind like that...
Shes in a place thats under a cloaking spell.
But no way is she an eyesore! Not on your life!
Hows the lady?
Please try to get along.I hope that youll be his friend.
Curse? A-AlteredT-Tweaked your body?
Come this way.
Now then, allow me to continue.
I adjusted our bodies so that we no longer need to feed upon humans to survive.can live without devouring humans.
After more than 200 years,
I always ask them beforehand if they wish to live on even as demons.
i1The scent shes giving off is pure and devoid of deception.
Miss Tamayo,
You mustnt do either.
Please tell me how.
it is necessary to study the blood of numerous demons.
and I believe that her body underwent changes during that time.
Yushirous hobby is to write in his Lady Tamayo journal.
Did you decide how to kill them?
And is the demon hunter accompanied by a demon?
Isnt this fun?
Its too careless. 
Lady Tamayo!
Dammit!
Its too dangerous outside!
La
i1yet there was no scent until they attacked!
Anyone who ruins the time I spend alone with you...
Its unforgivable!
i1She grew more arms!
i1And Yushirou needs time to prepare before he can attack.
Thanks, Yushirou!
Hurry up and defeat her then!
This is fun!
Third Form!
Miss Tamayo!
Most likely.
q2Two, to retrieve as many blood samples from demons with a high concentration of Kibutsujis blood as you can.
Flowing Dance!
So filthy!
Are you okay, Nezuko?
The demon hunter and the fugitive.
i1to close in on him!
Ill never forgive you!
Striking Tide!
i1Dont lose now!
i1It feels like my arms are about to get torn off!
i1Im too exhausted to even grip my sword!
Wh-Whats wrong?
What do you think youre doing? Here it comes!
Without devouring human blood...
i1If she were to go all-out, Nezuko wouldnt stand a chance.
Stop it!
i1It weakens its targets brain functions,
i1rendering that person unable to lie or keep secrets.
i1Its immensely potent, Lady Tamayo!
Did she just die?
Thats the curse.
i1And now,
Yushirou!
Oh, right!
Shes fine.
Thank you...
when I interact with humans as a doctor, people sometimes see through me.
The young and the elderly are particularly perceptive.
Very well.
Well be leaving after we erase all traces of ourselves.
Your kid sister...
is a beauty.
I got the message, so please!
Please! Please! Please!
Wh-Whats up with that?
What? I nailed it?
Okay, one last impression.
Next, Episode 11, Tsuzumi Mansion!
Nezuko?
Do you think you can do the opposite? Get smaller?
Smaller, Nezuko!
That's a good girl, Nezuko!
If you want to go to Mt. Sagiri, you'll have to cross over that mountain, but...
People have gone missing lately!
This is my turf.
Are you both humans?
Sh-She killed him!
Hard as a rock!
Nezuko! Where are you?
Nezuko!
So...
I'll have to crush his head!
To crush his skull and smash it completely,
Isn't there anything I can use to kill him with one blow?
He's gone with that much sunlight?!
You're just too slow at making decisions!
Nezuko, I know it must be jarring, but please be patient!
Well, being patient is all that you've ever known.
We're going to climb a mountain.
I'm so exhausted.
I'm starting to feel dizzy, too.
Now, from here, go back down to the house at the foot of the mountain.
I've already memorized Mr. Urokodaki's scent!
A pitfall?
I'm suddenly athletic enough
Nezuko!
He was brazen enough to attack me unarmed.
but please forgive me.
Tanjiro!
Im begging you!
Please!
Please! Please! Please!
Thats why I want you to marry me!
That uniform!
Youre the one with issues! Like your memory!
All right, Ive taken care of this issue.
 Stop it! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
P-Please, calm down!
You were crumpled up on the side of the road and looked ill!
All I did was speak to you!
Look, cut it out!
Wh-Whyd you get in my way? This has nothing to do with you!
Whats with that look on your face?!
Stop it!
What do you mean, save you?
The old geezer who took it over for me was a cultivator!
Ta-da!
This...
i1Hurt...
Yeah.
Tanjirou...
I dont hear anything.
Am I gonna die?
i1we mightve been able to save him.
Youll protect me, right?
E-Even still, it pains me that you left it behind!
Teruko.
Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die, Im telling you!
an8Let me go!
Step back and hide behind the shelves.
Its infuriating.
Curse them!
Im with the Demon Slayers.
i1The entire mansion is this demons territory!
Comin...
Say, Tanjirou,
i1Im picking up the scent of multiple demons in this house.
Its all right. There are no demons around.
Without so much as a backward glance.
It feels like my heart missed a beat!
Its just that... Well, sou see...
Youve been sweating, gasping, and shivering so horribly.
i1If I dont protect him, what will become of him?
i1This guy...
Okay.
You cant eat any more?
Is that all youve got?
Im stripping you of your number.
Do you think you can you tell me what happened here?
a-and I nearly got eaten.
The less common the blood is...
Strike it!
i1Can I beat him?
I have what it takes!
Th-The room...
i1Im the guy that gets things done!
Damn! This is so annoying!
Kyougai.
i1Just give it up, will you?
No beauty, no fragility, no impact to speak of.
Youre just wasting paper and fountain pens!
i1Not only that,
i1I see the opening thread!
Your Demon Blood Art was incredible!
i1I was told that under Yushirous spell, it would be invisible until it meowed,
Teruko!
Were so sorry!
You did a good job hanging in there.
Whats wrong?
Nothing.
i1Ive...
i1I can hear you guys, and also these weird, loud footsteps.
When the room spun around, we got thrown outside.
I fell right onto my head, didnt I?
My head is starting to spin.
Its him!
Demon Slayers?
Inside this box...
i1By listening closely,
I...
Let go of me, dammit!
Damn you!
You spineless punk!
this was more important to you...
and I hear that he was writing a biographical novel of his own.
Next, Episode 14, The House with the Wisteria Family Crest!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Take this!
My bad.
First...
Whats the matter?
i1How hard is it anyway?
Fight me! Fight me!
Just dont think anymore.
Follow yours truly!
Were descending the mountain.
Hold out your hands!
Time to rest! Time to rest!
Ke-ke-ke.
Hey!
She has to be a monster, Tanjirou!
Use your chopsticks.
Severe!
This bump hurts a lot more than my ribs.
Say youre sorry!
Ill pass!
Hes right about that.
Who are you to talk?
Ive got a keen sense of smell.
Its out!
Nezuko!
With a girl this cute in tow, day after day, youve been traveling,
If you mock the Demon Slayers...
Yes, sir!
Im Hashibira Inosuke!
Its also forbidden to hold bread in your mouth!
Pardon me, sir.
Tanjirou!
Your next mission is north-northeast!
Well be heading out now.
Thank you so much for everything.
Now then, for good luck.
She has no clue what her own place is, does she?
Im scared!
Why the hell is he sitting?
Who are you to talk, Pig Face?
What happened?
Thanks!
i1I wish you luck in battle!
No matter how many Mizunoto they send, it wont help!
We might find the Twelve Blood Moons there, then.
Not so long as demons eat humans. Not as long as?
i1If they both tried to talk me into going,
Lucky you, you dont have a care in the world.
I mean, look at how cute Nezuko is! And shes a demon!
There it is again.
Wheres it coming from?
They dont even know that were not allowed to fight each other!
And also, um...
Murata!
Dont disturb my familys peaceful life.
Mother?
What are you so mad about?
Beast Breathing! Seventh Form!
Found it?
Nezu
Where are you?
Dammit!
So, lets try not to hurt these
Lets go, Inosuke!
Or else therell be hell for me to pay!
I cant move my own body!
i1The demons forcing her to move her body with the threads,
Sure, you got it!
Hold
Oh, shut up!
i1To stop them from moving...
Take this!
Where did you all go?
i1There!
Lets try slashing from the base of its neck on the right side down to his left waist!
Crap! I forgot about the spiders!
I cant move!
i1Dammit, what the hell? This is annoying!
i1Its as if this was all predetermined or something!
i1Thats why I panicked!
i1But...
i1Its not agonizing.
Wait!
A genuine member of the Twelve Blood Moons...
Yeah, but I know what it is that you cant do, Inosuke.
After all this time, you still cant get my name right.
I cant find Tanjirou and Inosuke anywhere! This sucks!
Im sure these spiders are doing their best to survive too, but still!
Whats up with that? Whats up with that?
If this can all just be a dream, I promise Ill do my best!
i1Huge!
I dont wanna hear it, so stop talking to me!
I dont like guys like you, all right?
Whats this?
That poison will turn you into a spider, too.
you will have long become a member of my spider den!
Just so you know, Ive been training on my own in secret, too!
i1How tragic is my life anyway?
i1I was struck by lightning.
i1The hells his problem?
First Form!
i1Thats all right, Zenitsu.
i1Thats good enough for you.
If you can master even one, thats a cause for celebration!
i1So thats why you keep clobbering me day in, day out?
i1Youll be rendered immobile by that venom any minute now.
Just believe.
But Gramps said
i1But not Gramps!
i1But he never abandoned me!
i1Its a happy dream.
i1I became powerful and helped out a lot of people.
i1But now, its all over!
i1Dont ever give up!
Who are you calling father?
Tales of a Demon Slayer Academy!
Isnt the moon lovely?
Im only here to slay demons.
Agreed.
Second Form!
The blade wont go through!
i1The final and most powerful form!
i1Water Breathing!
W-Watch out!
Dont dieget killed before I get back!
Dont put us in the same category as something that frail.
ElseOr Ill cut you in pieces.
Even I can take down a kid like him.
What you said just now...
This is bad! This is really bad!
Dont mess around, dammit!
Looks like I got infected by Tontarous germs!
SlashedCut through you!
What doesnt hurt doesnt hurt!
Well, its a little too late for that!
i1This is starting to look pretty bad!
i1Inosuke.
i1Wh-Who are you?
i1Did he cut through him?
i1so I can detect the scent of the threads now!
What, you dont see me here? Look at me, dammit!
i1Amazing!
i1Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Simply amazing!
Fight me, Mismatched Haori!
Once Ive done that
Well?
Nezuko!
But she has the aura of a demon!
i1The wounds so deep!
i1Her left wrist is about to fall off!
Please wait a second!
Could you not raise your voice, please?Could you please not shout?
Nezuko!
Im your elder brother now.
Theres something different about her from other demons. thats different from any of us.
i1Water Breathing!
i1Ill lose!
i1Dont stop!
Or your brother will be killed, too!
No one will ever sever  Alternative: "The bond between us"
I wonder why I suddenly remembered the Dance for the Fire God at that moment.
This week, I have a Taisho secret about the Kamado Family!
Nezuko!
I won!
i1This ringing in my ears is brutal!
Poor kid.
Enough.
i1Get up!
i1If you use the correct breathing technique, it makes no difference how exhausted you are!
Because Rui is one of our lords favorites,
Tomorrow, Rui will be summoned by our lord and will descend the mountain.
The demon hunters arent far behind.
Hey...I hate ellipses but I think it works here?agreed
A demon!
Its futile. Youll never cut through it.
And then, itll be your turn.
Youll be reduced to mush in no time, and then Ill feed on you.
That does sound tragic!
No, of course not. I havent eaten that many
I only killed those five.
On the west side of the mountain, I saw hordes of cocoons hanging from the trees.
I can see that well never be friends.
What a pity!
i1Thats someone I can defeat!
I may be the only swordswoman among the Hashiras unable to decapitate demons, Does this need a split?
Shes already dead, so if we leave her, shell simply rot.
Your clothes did get dissolved, but your body is more or less unscathed!
Now then, as for the whereabouts of the demon that forced this girl to do his bidding.
i1Siblings!
i1I thought that if I could feel a family bond,
And now, its time for a Taisho secret!
DESTROY
The Demon Slayers battle the demons with their own mortal bodies.
Even so...
He may really want to kill me!
I made my descent today, sword in hand,
Though it's strong vertically, it's weak horizontally, so...
you need to apply the force straight along the blade.
And I'm going to teach you all ten of the Water Breathing forms.
This?
But it's not normal for her to stay asleep like this.
Come with me!
something you slice?
I wasn't training hard enough!
More!
I'm training.
And the breathing technique, too?
If you're a man!
since I'll be looking after you.
She corrected my unnecessary movements and bad habits.
Both he and I love Mr. Urokodaki very much.
and when your blood gets excited,
And my sword, which I was sure had slashed Sabito's mask...
i1I was never able to run.
i1Even walking was a struggle.
i1Such astounding parental love. And such a powerful bond, too.
i1Day after day, I missed my parents so much that I could barely stand it.
i1no matter how I strained to get my hands on it.
i1Now I remember as clear as day.
Rui...
It was all...
Im sorry! Im sorry!
Dont waste any sympathy on a demon that devoured humans.
Oh my?
Since he defeated the demon,
Y-Youre mistaken!
Take your sister and run.
i1Deal with it!
Unfortunately for you, I have no intention of joining you in stalling for time.Whether youre serious or not, Im not going to join you in stalling for time.
Is that your attempt at catching up with me?
but dont forget about the other one!
i1Dont stop!
i1A Demon Slayer!
Run, Nezuko!
Dont you have anything to say?
This is your final warning.
and brought back to headquarters!
Tanjirou, dressed in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead!
Wh-Who the hell is this?
Hes wearing our uniforms trousers.
Wake up.
Are you gonna sleep all day?
Dont you have anything to say?
People dont like you because of that lack of tact.
...do like me?
Any answer but that one please.
Demons.
Their physical prowess is remarkable. Wounds heal in the blink of an eye.
I am a trainer.
you must survive the Final Selection process held on Mt. Fujikasane.
I can't stop getting ensnared in all the traps!
1,000!
you need to apply the force straight along the blade.
and I charge Mr. Urokodaki really trying to kill him.
Mr. Urokodaki is bare-handed and unarmed.
But he's ridiculously powerful!
Today, I learned breathing techniques and some forms.
I get yelled at for not bracing my stomach
Next, he told me to become one with the water.
My descents are getting more dangerous,
Mr. Urokodaki, please wait!
I practiced over and over what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki.
I'll almost give in! I'm breaking down!!
if you're a man.
I'm trying every single day!
It was really beautiful!
She speaks in such an abstract, dreamy way.
You did great. Don't forget what you just did.
...had sliced the boulder.
Next, Episode 4, "Final Selection"!
an8Hey, I said wake up!
You're in the presence of the Hashiras!
an9LOVE HASHIRA MITSURI KANROJI
Inosuke!
Based on what Kocho told us,
Don't you have anything to say, Tomioka?
He did come along without resisting.
My sister got turned into a demon,
If she's family, no wonder you're defending her.
I just can't imagine the Master being in the dark about this situation.
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
an8- The Master... - The Master...
i1Wounded.i0
A Demon Slayer traveling with a demon is unacceptable!
If you want to die, then rot to death for all I care!
an8You mean this kid...
an8What was Kibutsuji doing?
First, tell us what powers Kibutsuji has!
It's unacceptable!
Excuses, excuses.
Nii-chan!
Mom!
Yeah.
What's with that all of a sudden?
You're blushing, Take!
an8Can I have some charcoal?
What happened here?
Don't move!
I don't know why she turned into something like that, but...
Once you become a demon, you can never go back to being a human.
Please!
Please don't do it!
If it was the least bit effective, your family wouldn't be dead!
But don't think that a demon would respect your will or wishes!
Why did you show your back to me?
Stop!
an8I'm sorry to leave you behind, Tanjiro.
Wait there for a second!
an8Get smaller!
I'm impressed!
I smell blood!
There's something off about you.
All right.
One of you is a demon after all? You gave off such a weird vibe!
Stop it!
Nezuko?
Carry your sister on your back and follow me!
I... have... returned.
an8Stop it!
EPISODE 23: HASHIRA MEETING
an8I'm only holding him down because he's trying to move.
I like it! Sounds flamboyant!
Poor soul...
she restrained herself and did not bite.
What do you think you're doing, Tomioka?
You must prove it to them starting now.
After training themselves to death, they have defied death,
All right, then! Take them away please!
Now then, let us begin the Hashira Meet
- Let go of me! - Cut it out!
We beg your pardon!
Don't you say another word!
Hello! Is anyone home?
an8but this mansion's something else, huh?
Tsuguko?
It's the girl from Final Selection.
Hey, somebody's forgotten how they got stomped on by Master Kanao last night.
- Uh... - We were ordered by Master Kocho!
I mean it's really bitter! It's such an ordeal!
an8What's gonna happen if I forget to take it? Hey! Hey! Hey!
an8I wonder what kind of person he is.
Most of them are useless.
Mitsuri Kanroji.
an8I look forward to your success.
Muzan Kibutsuji,
I still find it hard to believe that some demons don't attack humans.
If you're gonna go there, then, us trying to find a clue about Kibutsuji is...
They kill humans and feed on them.
and limbs can be newly regenerated.
I literally train swordsmen.
Next! Forms!
Wrong!
Come with me!
I will allow you to enter the Final Selection.
What do you mean?
Bring it on!
See, Full Focus Breathing accelerates your blood circulation
and your heart rate.
I can't thank them enough.
I heard that's because demons used to make fun of his face for looking too kind.
I'll work harder to turn Nezuko back into a human!
I didn't want to see children die anymore.
Tanjirou...
know the names of those dead children?
i1Wow.i0
blooms year-round from the bottom to halfway up the mountain.
an8and so demons abound.
From above?
Shut up!
Do you think Tanjirou can beat that one?
an8How do you know Urokodaki-san?
You're lying!
and they even kill their own kind!
an8I can't stop it!
Dammit!
Why did I devour you, Nii-chan?
What a sad scent.
Nii-chan! Nii-chan!
an8How do I turn someone who's become a demon back into a human?
Tsuchinoto.
Kasugai Crow?
I see.
Excellent.
Hey! Nezuko!
Nezuko!
Why...
There are several kinds of demons.
Right.
My name is Haganezuka.
Oh no, I'm the son of Tanjuurou and Kie.
an8Is that right? I had no idea.
Is it unlucky?
an9PREVIEW
I'd like to explain a few things to you.
That Demon Slayer Corps uniform you're wearing right now...
Built out of an extremely light wood called "Cloud Mist Pine."
I coated it with rock lacquer to reinforce its exterior
It's so light! It's really light, Urokodaki-san!
Because he was with Satoko-chan when she was taken.
She really did vanish.
I believe you.
Yes, Mother.
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
Eighth Form,
Calm down, my other self.
Hey, so what?
They were all quite meaty and delicious.
Nezuko!
Your kicks really saved the day, Nezuko!
Next, Episode 7, "Kibutsuji Muzan"!
If women live any longer, they turn ugly and start tasting like crap!
Start talking!
A kid like you?
an8I hope you'll find something of Satoko-san's in there.
I'm leaving that young woman in your hands!
I'm heading to my next mission already?
an8Come on, just give me a minute! Hold on! What?
an8Thank you very much.
an8It's all right.
an8No.
an9PREVIEW
A suit, huh?
What's going on?
Please take a cloth and press down hard on the wound!
It's dangerous here, Rei-san. Let's move over there.
I'll follow you to the ends of Hell,
and I swear I'll slice off your head with my blade!
What the hell are you doing?
Bring some restraints please!
an8What are all these patterns?
I'm also concerned about that disturbance just now.
Yacchan!
You bastard!
Is my face pale?
Those earrings...
So, you're gonna eat it?
Yes, I shall!
an8I'd like two bowls of udon!
As long as you get it! It's all good!
Sorry about that, Nezuko.
Leaving you behind like that...
No way could you find it.
i1Nezuko?i0
an8Just take a good look at her features!
an8Come on, let's go over there!
I have returned.
an8Sorry.
You were only able to transform Yushiro after more than 200 years?
Don't ask a lady her age, you uncouth ruffian!
Yushiro!
How should we kill them, I wonder.
an8Don't you dare get so close to Tamayo-sama!
At this time, I'm unable to turn a demon back into a human,
One, permission to study your sister's blood.
And yet, surprisingly, Nezuko shows none of those symptoms.
an8Lots of other people will be saved, too, right?
an7RUSTLE RUSTLE
Take the lady sleeping in the back room somewhere safe outside!
It's you, isn't it?
an8Anyone who ruins the time I spend alone with you...
They serve directly under Kibutsuji!
Hey! Moron demon hunter!
Arrows?
Tamayo-san!
Then, I'm going to extract blood from them for sure!
If you think you can extract blood from us Twelve Demon Moons,
Right! Understood!
Don't kick up dust like that.
an9PREVIEW
Surface Slice!
an8Nowhere near enough!
an8More...
an8Ridiculous!
Don't be so rash just because you're immortal!
Wh-What's wrong?
Tamayo-sama, is this...
I used a healing serum on her. Nothing more.
You're an amusing little girl!
This time, I'm going all-out against you!
Twelve Demon Moon demon girl there.
Stop it!
an8I do feel sorry for you, but...
You got that?
Ball...
Play with me.
But if you want to, then get down here.
Only joking!
Oh, right!
I moved her to this basement,
Why, you!
There's nothing to worry about.
She's fine.
All right.
Hey!
Your little sister...
Okay, one last impression.
TO BE CONTINUED
I got the message, so please!
What do you think you're doing right in the middle of the road?
That uniform!
Doesn't that mean that you talked to me because you were worried because you love me?
an8Goodbye!
That's a harsh way to put it!
The old geezer who took it over for me was a cultivator!
My brains are gonna get sucked through my ears while I'm still alive!
Please save me!
Hey, thanks.
Both of you head over to your next destination!
You smell something?
Ta-da!
See? Isn't he cute?
Did you two follow them here?
Is it a drum?
Made it outside.
Am I gonna die?
Hey,
Our brother's wearing a persimmon-colored kimono.
I-I-I'm gonna die!
I'm not! I can tell, all right? Zenitsu, you're
Sorry you got separated from your brother, okay?
I'm gonna die!
Teruko!
My own prey, discovered on my own turf!
an8A child with rare blood that I found myself!
Hey, Tanjirou,
Knock it off! There's a demon right there, you know!
You damn miserable insects!
What about it? Aren't I doing the best I can here?
but you're making me nervous, too, so...
If we talk too much, those demons and all will...
They might find us, right?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
W-W-We don't taste good! I'm sure I taste awful!
How will I know until I have a taste?
Zenitsu-san! Get up!
Make a run for it!
I can't do something like that!
an8I'm gonna guzzle your brain matter through your ears!
Zenitsu!
What are you talking about?
I've come to defeat evil demons.
a-and I nearly got devoured.
And I somehow held on until now!
I'm going to peck you now.
an8What do you mean by "rare blood"?
I'll follow your scent.
So infuriating!
Give it all you've got, Tanjiro! Give it all you've got!
You're gonna cheer me on, too, right, Nezuko?
You're the eldest daughter, but if anything bad happens to you,
TO BE CONTINUED
Are you heading into battle?
Is that you, Kocho?
Well, of course you wouldn't!
You seem to be doing well!
Looks like fun. Lucky you.
an7TWO WEEKS LATER
What happened?
That's it!
In simpler terms, you'll be playing tag.
Snap!
I'm always fighting back tears from the pain, but he's laughing.
Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke?
Um...
Sorry! I didn't hear you.
Thanks! That's a big help!
Yes!
an8Just tell them my injury's taken a turn for the worse!
an8Would you like to have some tea with me?
Lady Shinobu often had her blow into gourds.
The gourds get bigger and bigger as you progress.
The one that Lady Kanao can explode right now...
Hard work! Hard work!
an8Yoo-hoo!
Yes.
an8I'm quite sure you can accomplish that!
Ever since my beloved big sister was slaughtered by a demon.
Yes! Because I've acquired a precious drug.
Sniff, sniff! You're also feeling sad, right?
is it just me, or are we just going around and around in circles?
just flipped!
I'm not handing over Kiyoshi... the rare blood to you!
an8I'm not giving up!
an8and reclaim my place among the Twelve Demon Moons!
i1My...i0
and my drum playing...
have been recognized.
Tanjirou-san...
Yes!
Take this!
The monster boar!
I'm with the Demon Slayer Corps like you!
I'm not moving!
I could tell what someone was thinking.
And that it's a reason I can accept! I believe that!
After all that bluster,
an9PREVIEW
Listen to me!
Actually, hasn't Tanjirou broken the taboo himself?
Cut it out! Don't do stuff like that!
calm down!
Why the hell are you staring at my face like that?
Nope, I'm done!
You think so?
There are still people who were killed inside the house.
What is that person doing?
Hey!
We're not done with our battle yet!
I won't have it! I won't have it!
That will ward off demons.
Demon repellent!
We can get home on our own.
Fight me!
Who the hell are you?
Hey!
Your bedding.
Who would've guessed that all three of us had broken ribs?
What's up with that?
He's right about that.
Don't lump me in with you!
You really shouldn't heap so much praise on me!
an8It's trying to come out! It's trying to come out!
an8It's all right.
Oh my gosh! It's not even locked?
Button your shirt.
an8NO HAIR COLORING
Nezuko-chan!
an8What do you think you're doing, old hag?
Hold up!
Help me!
That twisted, ominous scent I was picking up from the mountain...
Let's go.
the Slayers...
an8Don't you agree, Tomioka-san?
You're not cute at all! I mean it! Not that side of you!
Where's it coming from?
They're not moving normally!
I'm gonna slash them to ribbons!
It's no good, Inosuke!
Where the hell do you think you're going? Fight me! Fight
an8Why did he show up anyway?
You want me to find where that demon's at, right?
an8Found it!
Stop chirping and help me find her, Chuntaro!
What are you so mad about? Here, eat this and calm down.
Leave these guys to me and go on ahead!
Dammit! I'm gonna punch that guy if it's the last thing I do!
Stop talking like that!
So, anyway, we're heading the right way, right?
No.
The closer you get to me,
So, please! Not your father!
My arms and legs...
the pain's intense!
These guys are speedy, too.
Nezuko-chan! Where are you?
an8This way! I'm gonna catch up to 'em soon!
Nezuko-chan!
Inosuke, let's fight together! Let's think together!
Be careful.
Anything you can do, I can do, too, you know!
an8I think I'm gonna cry!
I'm sure these spiders are doing their best to survive, too, but still!
You're already losing.
I don't wanna hear it, so stop talking to me!
What's this?
Shut up! Just shut up!
i1Me?i0
Are you going down the mountain?
No, no, because you're severely wounded.
I am not wounded at all!
an8Don't come near my family!
an7COMBINED JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL!! TALES OF A DEMON SLAYER ACADEMY
Were you acquainted with any of them?
an8Don't come near my family!
What should I do?
All that force with just one swipe of its arm!
I-Inosuke!
this is between me and my sister.
That's not what you call a bond!
Say it, will you?
an8This is bad! This is really bad!
Don't mess around, dammit!
I'll do you a favor and kill you at once.
Now what?
Don't die!
Don't die until I get back!
Just bring it on, you dirtbag!
Hey!
I hear that Tanjirou's favorite rice ball flavor is plum seaweed,
Hey, so you can talk!
TO BE CONTINUED
Sure I can tell!
I said hold up a second!
I want it!
Wait a minute! Please!
The thing is, I was really moved.
But there's just one thing.
I'll teach her what will happen if she defies me.
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
A father has his role as the father,
No matter what.
an8The way I see it,
Nezuko's gone!
But it looks like I'll have to teach her a lesson after all.
You don't think that if you get close enough to me, you can chop off my head, do you?
Hey...
i1Father...i0
i1Nezuko...i0
can't be...
Thanks to that, I was able to slice through that demon's neck with my blade!
TO BE CONTINUED
Nezuko!
My father saved me!
an8I haven't been this enraged in a long time.
You did a good job holding out until I got here.
You're like an endless stream...
i1Lull.i0
If we let it go, it'll devour humans!
You want me save you?
will you do what I ask?
Because Rui is one of that person's favorites,
or get strung up, exposed to the sunlight.
How disappointing.
Rui!
an8This isn't some show, you know.
A demon!
an8I beg of you!
That spell you cast to turn one of our men into a cocoon was most impressive!
an8You've devoured at least eighty humans, haven't you?
All massacred.
All dead.
I'm only trying to confirm the accurate toll.
What good will it do you to confirm that?
an8Let's both give it our all!
and neither will there be any after effects!
You damn witch!
Did Tomioka-san beat me to it, then?
an9PREVIEW
to make sure there are no more victims,
I will never trample over them!
They're tragic creatures!
That goes for him, too.
Still, I'd like to wrap things up quickly
Well, I'm sorry. You haven't even realized that you were hated, then?
an8I mean, you're not mistaken, but...
Is that right? Poor thing.
an8I shall use a gentle toxin to kill her, so she won't suffer, all right?
i1Nezuko!i0
I have a message from headquarters!
Bring them back! Bring them back!
Tanjirou, dressed in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead!
an8They wrapped us up like mummies.
I'll be hunting down the demons in the area
an8Come on, you! Come on!
You didn't deny it, so does that mean it's true?
why don't you explain the crime you've comm
There's no need for a trial!

Why are you traveling with a demon when you're a Demon Slayer?
No need to ask.
Um...
My sister...
My beloved children...
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
I wonder if the sky is blue.
with no personnel changes.
I fervently pray for your continued good fortune.
Before we start the Pillar Meeting, would you mind enlightening us
an8Because of her resilient mental strength,
an8Nezuko has not lost her human emotions.
It's no guarantee! Not by a long shot!
an8It won't bring back the people who were killed!
an8The fact is that Nezuko has refrained from devouring humans for more than two years,
an8To reject this notion,
an8Where did this take place?
I will prove it to you myself!
But the way that boy stood up to a Pillar was so brave!
What is this, a free-for-all?
TO BE CONTINUED
can you clobber me with these carpet beaters?
It's all good, right?
Master Tanjiro's doing a good job!
This time, for sure!
Let's just go ahead and try it!
Well, why wouldn't you be able to do it, though?
Kanao, you're in the same class, so why don't you join them?
Yahoo!
Let's go! Let's go!
Hey! Hey! Mr. Haganezuka!
How have you been?
You're pitifully weak! That's why it broke!
He loves his swords more than anyone.
There's no one like him even in the sword-forgers' homeland.
It's a fine color for a sword.
an8We're sorry! We're sorry!
We're sorry!
I did it!
Since you're physically sound now,
Right!
Uh, w-well then,
I'm not familiar with the details myself.
Right.
She's asleep all day again today.
You think so, too, Nezuko?
They're both good guys.
Maintaining Total Concentration Breathing is way too demanding!
Next, Episode 26, "New Mission."
Look, it's the human blood you love so much!
your veins will burst.
an8Though I don't know how it happened!
That you can be useful.
Nezuko and I will do it for sure!
that the Pillars of the Demon Slayer Corps have phenomenal skills.
Y-Yes, sir!
-Tokitou-sama! - We beg your pardon!
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
Hey, there's someone.
It's Tsuyuri Kanao-sama.
an8I gotta take this five times? A day?
Listen, are they really gonna heal? Tell me how they're gonna get healed!
Inosuke, I'm so glad you're all right!
an8I'm so sorry! I couldn't rescue you!
an8Is that you, Inosuke?
Why are you cackling in that creepy way all of a sudden?
Hang in there, Inosuke!
Zenitsu...
I need to...
Just listening to him speak made my head feel light.
an8And then,
an8the demon Nezuko will end up all alone.
Most of them are useless.
The more the human population increases,
or even greater resolve and drive to produce results would be cruel.
an8My children,
Kibutsuji Muzan,
an8We will bring you down without fail.
That's a typical and flamboyant idea if I ever heard one!
we Pillars need to be the glue that holds the Demon Slayer Corps together!
Are you mentally prepared for that, Sound Pillar?
Don't worry, it's not as if I'll gobble him up, all right?
Take your medicine this second!
You seem to be doing well!
Hey!
It looks like it's going to take some time.
Hello!
What's the matter? Hey...
The objective is to throw that medicated water onto each other,
you can't move that cup.
i1But...i0
Tanjirou-san?
Isn't it about time you came to training, Inosuke?
Yes!
Whenever she trained Kanao-san,
No. You don't have to concern yourself with those two anymore!
an8Hello there!
Don't you feel lonely all by yourself?
I'm going to turn Nezuko back into a human for sure!
Since Aoi-san has been training under Shinobu-san,
Sniff, sniff! For some reason
Because I enjoy talking with you, Tanjirou-kun.
TO BE CONTINUED
Spineless fool...
Please let me try again!
I refuse to get involved!
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!
but I can't get the hang of anything even if he shows me for hours!
an8but I bet you two can do it!
I can do it, all right! Why wouldn't I?
an8Please give it your all, Zenitsu-kun!
an8I'm your biggest cheerleader!
We're sorry! We're sorry!
After all, Tanjirou-san was really giving it his all!
an6SENSE OF REASON
What? They're not the same thing?
Here's a Taishou secret for you!
We'll train some more?
TO BE CONTINUED
Holy -
P-Please forgive us!
the members of the Upper Moons of the Twelve Demon Moons remain unchanged.
It's always been the demons of the Upper Moons
How many times have you been replaced?
an8the only thing on your mind is escape.
If you could give me just a short reprieve, I swear I'll be of use to you!
How long a reprieve are you asking for, specifically?
I'm the one who calls all the shots. My word is absolute.
Still, if you do manage to acclimate,
You are to join Rengoku Kyoujurou on site.
I have decided to send Tanjirou and the others on the Infinite Train mission.
an8Ah...
At this time, there's no denying that he still has a way to go,
I just decided whether or not to speak to you.
It doesn't matter.
Yes.
Thanks!
Whether or not...
you're going to listen hard to the voice in your own heart from now on!
you're going to follow your heart!
And if it was tails,
We'll do our best!
Yes!
That's all.
You're all heartbroken to say goodbye to me, aren't you?
I can stay behind if you want!
I bet this is that thing!
What are you doing? Hey, you!
The police! Call the police!
Zenitsu!

an9LOWER ONE
Since you've assumed a different form and aura...
Rui was killed.
Please forgive me, Master Kibutsuji!
an8I believe that the Twelve Kizuki are better off consisting of just the Upper Ranks.
an8I am now dismantling the Lower Ranks.
Shut up. I misunderstood nothing.
I'm the one who calls all the shots. My word is absolute.
Make yourself useful to me, then.
an8Ah...
At this time, there's no denying that he still has a way to go,
but perhaps Rengoku, the Flame Pillar, might be able to provide some guidance.
We're heading out now.
Hey! What's that?
Yes.
Okay! Let's toss this to decide!
Yes.
I had no idea you were putting your life on the line.
What the hell is this creature?
an8See how long it is? So intimidating! No mistake!
I'll lead the charge!
You never know, it might be the guardian spirit of this land.
We the Demon Slayers aren't officially recognized by the government!
Susumu...
who died while I'm in charge.
We should go too!
Don't leave me behind!
It's the least I can do.
Delicious!
Not just some random glutton?
Yeah.
A mission?
he could still perform a kagura dance in the snow.
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,
Flame Breathing has a long history.
Flame.
Mist is a fork of Wind.
I've never known a swordsman with a black sword that became a Hashira.
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!
What is this?
You will not lay a finger on that man!
Please make me your apprentice!
an1Me, too, please!
Big Bro Rengoku!
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!
Hey! You stop that right now!
I was having a bad dream or something.
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...
Just leave it to me!
And I can hear it breathing as it sleeps, squeak!
So what if you've become a Hashira?
The man who'd raised us both with such enthusiasm...
Let's do our best!
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!
It's hot,
an3I like them, too!
Welcome home, Tanjiro.
Could you get the bath ready?
Wake up!
This is a dream!
Fight!
You just had seconds!
What should we do? The fire...
I have to hurry back!
an7Big Bro!
Big Bro...
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?
What are you doing in the realm of the subconscious?
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko.
If everyone else is asleep, we're in big trouble!
in order to wake up.
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!
Thanks.
Is he the one who was connected to me?
What this demon did is unforgivable.
I understand.
inside your dream and inside your soul.
The air is so clear, and it feels good.
Is that his spiritual core?
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.
Nezuko!
Good morning!
Would you have liked that one better?
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.
How dare you go on living without a care.
It was way too easy.
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!
Inosuke!
That means I was a total stud as a leader!
Fall onto your knees...
Water Breathing...
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.
What about Rengoku?
It's so cramped!
But this demon is
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?
Uh-oh!
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...
Wake up!
You loser eyeballs!
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!
Because of its screams and tremors,
H-Hey, is your belly okay?
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!
Cool, huh?
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!
Even though he never broke the spell completely!
That brat is to blame!
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,
Am I going to lose?
A torn blood vessel.
That's it. Stanch it. Stop the bleeding.
That's a fine sword.
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.
Then, it looks like our senses of value are completely different.
Why don't you become a demon, too?
I can tell your strength at a glance,
Become a demon, Kyojuro.
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.
Watching the hideous decline of someone blessed with extraordinary powers...
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.
It happens to everyone!
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!
Blazing Universe!
because I know that even if I jumped in to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!
Kyojuro, why...
That mental strength!
I'm the Flame Hashira...
I see hi
What unbelievable strength!
I've pierced through his solar plexus with my right arm!
I have to...
No way I am ever letting go!
Pierce!
The Demon Slayer Corps...
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!
Rengoku didn't lose!
You're badly injured, too, remember?
Let's talk a bit one last time.
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...
Mother...
Was it that strong? I mean...
Yeah.
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,
you still have to go on living!
There are tears flooding out from that headpiece.
Rengoku...
So, not one of the 200 passengers lost their lives?
Kyojuro did a great job, then.
We should go too!
Don't leave me behind!
Sorry! We're very sorry!
It's the least I can do.
He's a Hashira, right?
Not just some random glutton?
Delicious!
he could still perform a kagura dance in the snow.
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura that I'd seen as a child.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
Um, can you try to help me a little more?
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?
Flame Breathing has a long history.
Stone.
And just what are you looking at?
You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?
I'm getting off!
Mr. Conductor...
I had a hard time detecting you.
There's still one more.
Excuse me.
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.
Calm down.
Hey!
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.
Four...
Six...
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!
I'm all right.
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!
Come over here! Look, I'll give you these sparkly acorns! C'mon!
Hey!
'Neither you...
He told me that it meant nothing.
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!
Let's do our best!
What an odd realm of the subconscious.
It's burning up.
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.
Okay!
What did I just say?
Yeah, I'm home!
In broad daylight?
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.
Wake up!
on board the train!
an9Big Bro!
My Nichirin Sword...
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?
If none of this had happened...
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!
But I will never forget you!
How can it be so beautiful?
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?
Wh-Who the heck knows?
I wonder why.
Oh well...
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?
I think I know what it is.
It's burned off.
Is a demon controlling her?
Get out of our way!
Are you all right?
Is he in the first car?
Stay away from me and wait!
So, he came right to me!
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!
Go to sleep.
Even if it's in the middle of a dream, to commit suicide...
insult...
Could this be a dream, too?
the more than 200 passengers on this train...
as well as my hostages.
What should I do? What should I do?
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!
Glorify me!
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here, I should go on ahead!
First Form...
First Form...
Sixfold.
I'll protect you...
Nezuko!
That sounded like thunder,
This is bad! What should I do?
It's so cramped!
How could this be?
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!
Amazing! I can't even see him!
Five cars, all by himself?
Understood!
Whirlpool!
Directly below this place.
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon, we won't be able to make it!
Inosuke!
Are you okay, Santaro?
Is your belly okay?
Your belly that got stabbed!
Because my minion asked me to!
before it's too late.
After all the time and trouble I've taken!
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?
Even after receiving so much of his blood, I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!
Make your nerves reach every corner of your body.
Great! Looks like you stopped it.
You'll be able to do all kinds of things when you master breathing.
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
There are hordes of injured people, but no one's life is in danger.
What's he doing here and now?
So, this is an Upper Rank,
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.
Let me tell you why you can't enter the realm of the highest.
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.
Not when only the chosen ones can become demons!
Flame Breathing...
When he strikes the air with his fist, the attack will reach me here!
and these breathtaking sword skills will be lost, too...
Nice moves!
I'll pass!
Blazing Universe!
Air Type!
I can't move...
Fourth Form...
Blooming Flame Undulation!
Destructive Death..
But what about you?
but this always happens after I use the Hinokami Kagura technique!
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!
That mental strength!
Set your heart ablaze.
Ren...
Say that you'll become a demon!
I don't know!
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.
It is the duty of those born strong to help the weak.
Make sure you never forget that.
I have to get away from the sun!
Don't run away!
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!
Rengoku didn't lose!
He didn't let anybody die!
You're the one who lost!
You'll reopen that stomach wound.
I believe in your little sister.
Go ahead and live with your head held high!
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...
set your heart ablaze.
I believe in you.
Get over here! We're gonna train!
What a remarkable child.
I'm going back to sleep.
Good morning, Ren.
With that raging spirit of yours, aim for it, Ren.
That aside, how about it, kid?
I see. Me neither.
Even I don't carry leeks with me.
Well, all of the people are looking at me.
What are you saying, Ojou-chan?
It's only a case of anemia. Let me down.
I'm Kuonji Miyu, not some little girl.
Which is masculine and fine.
Move out of the way. This maid just pissed me off.
Please forgive us on account of my pretty smile.
Rest assured, I made sure I pulled my punches.
What's with this guy?
What an interesting guy.
People have to help each other out in times of trouble. That's what you said.
You wouldn't have collapsed from anemia if you didn't try to prove yourself.
I'm not a loli, but a grown-up woman, hmph.
Meaning: Everything that exists in the universe.
My interests include loving cute things.
Natose-san, yeah!
Now my unique character will surely be recognized.
I am the maid chief.
Tajiri Yasushi.
Snuggle.
Huh? What's going to happen?
Finally, the two of us can live happily ever after.
You...
However, attitude alone won't be enough to defeat me.
Idiot, your morning greetings are incorrect!
It's a pleasure.
I'm envious!
Is that so?
Kuruppo!
Then, it's time for work.
Hatodekopin!
Good morning, Ojou-sama.
Yumecchi, your obentou!
Get out of the way!
Please have a nice day at work.
The butler attire looks good on you.
In the Kuonji household, servants are part of the family.
Follow Natose's example.
Colonel, tell us about your adventures.
But, knowing you, Colonel, I bet you completed the mission all by yourself.
Huh, of the track team?
I can't wait until summer, Ren.
Yes, I mean, no, not at all!
Once you top it with cream...
A butler's work is harder than I imagined.
Can it be that you're the type who always wanted a little brother, Natose-san?
Huh? Is this person your friend?
It's piercing me!
I'm Inamura Keiko.
What the?
The person that just flew by is Kojuurou, my steward.
It certainly isn't martial arts. You have too many holes.
You have dirt on the edge of your right shoe.
Good for you, Ren-kun!
This is tasty, you know.
If you get carried away, you're going to blunder at the end.
I guess it was there, or I guess it wasn't.
For the sake of Yume Ojou-sama...
Ren-kun, you'll be all right, for sure.
That you're a strong minded person who would never run from something, no matter how excruciating it is.
Thank you very much!
I bet you can't appreciate music.
Okay, here.
No, I don't think I want to!
I'll go clean up.
If I'm wrong, you may punish me to your heart's desire.
Her brother will do for Onee-chan...
The protagonist augmentation is awesome, you know.
He can go out with as many girls as he wants.
A protagonist is quite impressive.
I feel so grateful. I'm glad to be alive!
As I thought, it's Yume!she's the dum dum girl
The opponent's offense surely had us on the edge of our seats, Benisu-san.
Cheering for the Bays gets me fired up!
I wish I could bring over Ren to teach him how wonderful this is.
How come you didn't invite Ren?
What's the matter?
Go!
You're really sloppy.
Sake sure tastes good.
What?
Right.
So, now that we're getting into the mood, let's begin with the parlor tricks.
Huh? Why me, all of a sudden?
F-Fight for it, Natose-san!
Don' tell me you're going to liven it by...
This is incredible!
Preparations are ready.
Sounds like a bad shrine.
Preparations are complete.
Just what I expected!
This is my lethal kick!
You better not get muscle pains from walking.
Oh? Then, I'll join you.
What's the matter, Ren-chan?
Yo, son.
So this is where you were.
Hato-nee, we siblings will be here forever.
Yup yup!
Do you think you said something clever?
I don't see any people in this area. Is this the Kuonji private property?
What are you doing? Come, come.
Good morning!
Sweaty, moist skin sure feels great!
But before I knew it, you've become a bona fide butler.
I...
Huh? Isn't it Yume's turn next?
Shinra-sama, you can't just...
I see. Then, it can't be helped.
Sit next to me.
Shinra-sama, what kind of person is your mentor?
Huh? Well, he was a strict person, but he loved music from the heart.
After all, she had a hard schedule today.
Yes, you were magnificent.
But that was all.
Croissant?
Here we go! Leave it to Yume in times like this!
Time expired, huh.
A commander must pay the price with his life!
If you're not going to cower, come get me!
What is this?
W-Well, you're right about that.
I see.
Shinra-sama...
It seems like you got carried away, kid.
She died because she gave birth to you!
Don't succumb to your fate.
opening song
Nee-san, explain why.
I've had enough of you!
I...
It's really nothing.
Welcome home, Shin Onee-chan!
But, you seem to be uptight these days, not acting like the Shin Onee-chan I know of.
Yeah, his frank attitude is so pleasing, I feel as if I can be naked, not having to hide anything.
You're always like that.
Nee-san, you should stop acting stubborn and open up.
Why did I do such a stupid thing?
You talk casually.
Really?
Are you concerned about something?
I want to remain here forever!
N-Nothing...
Shinra-sama, I don't want to cause you trouble when the concert is approaching.
Beni!
My sister's doctrine:
Any man who hits a woman is a scum!
Because, every time I see your face, I get pissed.
What's the matter?
So, when are you coming back?
De Niro, it's punishment time!
Huh?
Ren-kun, what about your promise to read manga with Yume?
Isn't it about time to decide on whom you're going to serve exclusively?
Um... Yume also... that is...
You ordered me to wake you up at this time.
Please excuse me.
Occupation: butler.
...apprentice.
Ah, that was refreshing.
You fool!
I don't think he's someone who would go and look for us.
Just when we finally ran away from home I remember that violent geezer!
We'll be together forever.
Let's aim for a place to live-in!
Ah my dear brother. He's so wonderful and honest.
I don't take live-ins.
She's cool.
Such a lifestyle wouldn't be bad.
I have a brother complex.
I'm sorry.
As expected!
But only that isn't good for your beauty.
I have to hurry and find a job.
I'll take that radio-controlled thing too.
Hey! I'm not radio-controlled!
Why can't I defy that commanding voice?G: okay, I can see that is Giant pummeling Nobita Doraemon
I'm Kuonji Miyu.
Here.
We're here.
Miyu-sama!
It's naughty and appropriate.G: naughty is appropriate? tlc?
It has a refined taste, doesn't it?G: i think this has refers to "does have"
Want a fight?!
Do you think I'l succumb to this?!
I shall teach you a little lesson.
Please rest assured.
Not yet...
Not yet!
You're not crumbling away?
He passed out while standing.
Where am I?
Oh, Shinra.
That easily?
That's what you said.
You are at the same age as Yume and it sounds all fun.
First you have to know people and their names.
Hato-nee, it's rude to laugh at that.
Nice to meet you.
And your real name?
In episode two, Ren transfers into the school where I'm the student council president.G: muahahaha hinagiku
Huh?
Occupation: butler.
I said that earlier...
The belonging of the mistress is the mistress'.
Geez!
Yes!
Yep, yep.
The world is tough.
Such a lifestyle wouldn't be bad.
I should go back.
Miss. I'm Shibuya Takuya.
Don't say such tough things.
Here's my secret stuff, instant ramen!
As expected!
My head is feeling...
What's with this girl?
She's collapsing.
Hey, miss, are you all right?
Don't worry.
I'm Kuonji Miyu.
Please eat as much as you want.
It has a refined taste, doesn't it?G: i think this has refers to "does have"
Want a fight?!
This maid annoyed me!
You'll get your back booted.
I'm sorry, but with that attitude you'll only trouble your sister.
What the hell i-is he?
Not yet...
He passed out while standing.
I'll do my best!
...sa-sama.
That easily?
You'll be fired without pardon.
Yes ma'am! I'll do my best!
Don't mind, Yume.
Don't give in, Yume.
...call me Shinra-sama.
Ah... Okay... ah hah
Huh?
Hato-nee, it's rude to laugh at that.
Nice to meet you.
I guess it can't be helped.
So, first of all we'll see how you do in your trial time.
What the?!
Don't be absurd!
Your morning salutation is wrong!
Er...
Dear friends, welcome to this special morning.
I'm honored to work with you.
Is that so?
And me?
Yumecchi! Your boxed lunch!
So, personal means...
Of course.
Let me go!
Kuruppo!
Mihato!
You don't have to be embarassed.
Ah, Ren-kun.
Being a butler is harder than I anticipated.
Doesn't that make you happy?
Let's put our hearts in it and serve them! arr osund a bit awkward
Ah... Your cold gaze...
So this is your school.G: yume is beside him :
Yo!
This is our newcomer, Uesugi Ren-kun.
All of you?
She's being artificially fed.
Yes. He's Uesugi Ren-kun.
I will...
Since you are so beautiful, the dirt stands out.
I'm glad for you, Ren-kun.
It really is. Delicious!
Right, my bosom friend, Ren?
M-Morning...
Tomorrow I'll be an official butler of the Kuonji family, huh.
The ferret of the school's board member's wife ran away in the neighborhood.G: edit from A board member of the schools wife in the neighborhood's ferret ran away.
On top of that, a ferret...
Don't take it personally!
Hato-nee did?
No matter how mortifying it was, you would never give in and stand up against it, she said.
First, Uesugi Mihato,
breaking the Kuonji family's pot is an unforgivable act!
However, because of your hard work and funny character, I'll ignore that incident.
Mihato will be Mistress Miyu's personal attendant.
Huh?
Onee-chan.
Come with all you've got!
Hato-nee?
Your morning salutation is wrong!
Today, Uesugi Mihato and Ren's one week trial period will begin.
Is that so?
What we really need is a personal attendant for Miyu-san.
Natose-san, Ren-kun, I see both of you are in high spirits.
something like that.
Come on, let's create a clean world!
That's kind of unsettling.
I set my eyes on you without noticing it.
Of course.
Food tastes better when we are all together, doesn't it?
The red things...
Take Natose as an example.
Come on, don't say that.
You saved me, Mihato.
My sister has a habit of teasing things she likes.
You two should be careful, too.
Oh, Ren.
So this is your room, Natose-san.
Being a butler is harder than I anticipated.
But pleasing others is our job after all.
Could it be that you always wanted a little brother?
Are you all right?
Ageha-sama!
It's your everyday skinship, right?
You have way too many openings.
I cannot dishonor Mistress Yume now!
Hardships?
To be given personally by Ageha-sama means, it's the ultimate spice!
Ren-nii, just a bit more till your are officially hired.
Good night.
Please punish me.
Come on, hit me! you can use whip me too
You saved me, Kei-san.
There was one... Or it wasn't...
I-I...
Don't blame Ren-kun.
No, this happened because of his thoughtlessness.
Huh?
Shinra-sama is a great conductor, you know.
Cello, play the rhythm with more care.
Continue. hai, tsudukete
Oh, it isn't?
Don't be so nervous.
The sight of Shinra-sama at work is amazing.
I've had enough.
There's someone who wants to move nearby.
Yes? What is it?
It was like an indirect kiss, which made me feel kind of happy!
I don't care.
If you want to be my personal butler, that is.
Try talking to onee-chan.
"It's okay to be seen."
You win when you capture your opponents' flags and bring them to your base. play CTF
Don't forget that this is just a game.
Beni, from the right; Ren, from the left;
Give it back!
Objective accomplished!
However, Natose is chasing them!
I'm counting on you.
My duty is to hold her up, so is it alright if I run away? wut was that some weak ARCHER copy pasta?
I'll be taking the flag back.
Shinra-sama's team has captured the flag.
Don't say "others"!
She's retreating way too fast.
Holding back the kid shouldn't be much of a problem.
However, Myu-tan must have thought of that as well.
Onee-chan's secret tool, rope!G: can't imagine what she did to her brother...
Beni!
Shinra-sama, please run away!
I won't allow that!
All they have to do is put Miyu-sama's flag in their base.
Now then, victory is ours.
Huh? What's this?
Miyu-sama's possessions are Miyu-sama's. miyusama no mono ha miyusama no mono
This is...Shinra-sama's!
Mistress Yume tried to protect the flag on her own.
That difference decided the victor.
Can you at least knock?
Well, whatever.
You can divide twenty-one by three and seven!
This is the car we usually use.
This is what you call an elegant overtake.
The sight of Shinra-sama at work is amazing.
Good work!
I've had enough.
It was like an indirect kiss, which made me feel kind of happy!
Ren, I have to do something very quick.
How the heck can it be okay!!
is the best after all.
Give up, and receive my eternal love.
We haven't had this festival in a long while.
It was originally created to see the cooperation between master and servant.
However, it's not just a game.
Don't forget that this is just a game.
We'll be on the offensive, got it?
For such a clever girl like me to be wrapped around your finger...
This might turn out surprisingly well for me.
I'm counting on you.
An elegant touchdown!
Beni, finish her.
That's scary.
Though he must still be affected by the damage from Natose's attack.
Beni!
Was my tactic too mature for you?
Touch... down!
I'm forgetting something...
Since you're here, I'll have you wash my back.
Yume...
Here, cool it down with ice cream.
No, he's just going to a southern island for training.
Colonel!
Yes!
She's definitely not ordinary.
Huh?
Talking as if you have something to look at...
Where did you hide my swimsuit?
Give my adult bikini back!
Sister, can't you show a bit more moderation!
All right! Let's swim!
This is...!
I can't read it.
I'll dye you in my color!
This is...!
That thing from earlier...
Run for your life, you hog!
Rule one for tomorrow: You will scoop under your left side with your elbow so you won't drop it.
Once your body learns to move naturally with it, you'll be able to serve others better.
Do 300 pushups.
Everyone must be having so much fun on this vacation.
Ageha-sama!
For example.
I'll treat you since I'll keep winning.
Well done on making it to the end.
Where's the switch?
Oh, it's just you, Ren-kun.
D-Did anything happen?
Grown women have many secrets.
Please don't look this way!
It's strange, isn't it?
Yes.
You've made real progress in this short time.
Please.
Oh, you have come back.
Huh? What's this?
You have graduated from the primary level.
Ren, it's really tasty.
Thank you very much.
Natose-san always takes care of you...
If you don't have money, then I'll have you pay it back with your bodies.
Don't look at me like that.
17, 19, 21...
Yes, that's the spirit.
Y-You were watching me?
U-Um... it was just... that is...
Come in.
Hey, Ren-kun, you can't go now...
All troops, attack!
First of all, De Niro, switch to battle mode!
We should save our strength for the subsequent cleaning duties.
But in case Yume defeats both Shin Onee-chan and Miyu Onee-chan...
All troops, attack!
If the chief of security of the Kuonji estate gets serious, she's troublesome!
Shit...
Namo Amitabha.Namo Amida Butsu
Although you told me to hold fort, is it okay to run away?
Fine, as long as you buy enough time for us.
I'm the picture perfect butler.
Huh? I dare you!
Not so fast!
Team Shinra-sama's victory is just around the corner.
Welcome to my recital.
This is Shinra-sama's.
Geez...
Ah, you're so cute in every which way, Miyu-tan!
ed
It's really nothing.
Pretty...
I-I'm sorry!
It's hot!
Miyu-san, please calm down!
Sounds great.
There must be lots of tasty food there, right?
Neither of us have one.
It's my first time!
Oh no, please.
All right! Let's swim!
Ren, we are going over there.
As if you really mean it!
This voice is...
Kojuurou...
This is 'jumping'.
Piece of cake.
If I happen to lose my life, than that shall be my satisfaction.
Good, next.
I'm bored.
Alright, I'll keep emptying this place!
Beni, let's get the money and go home.
Really? Can I order more?
Thanks!
A-Ageha-sama!
Kojuurou made it to 300.
D-Did anything happen?
Um, well...
You're cute.
It was normal when I wasn't around until just recently.
T-This is...
All right!
You like it in a bottle, don't you?
Next episode's KimiAru will be a recap.
Although I would love to see that.
The Colonel will definitely win.
Since you have such a pretty skin, you have to take care of it.
Are you sure it's okay to come to the ocean even as a machine?!
Panicking over that...
Miyu, I wish you would learn the same honestyhonestness she possesses.
You were aboutgoing to say goodbye to your walletpocket!
Miss.
Um, then I'll be back another time!
Yeah, at the marketplace we met a local girl...
Even I know it.
The one who needs help is actually that dude.
She's pretty cute.
and even if we scream, nobody will hear it and come save us.
That's why we'll make you entertain us in place of that!
Oh, though since no one wants you, I guess you're desperate even for her.
Provoking them on purpose and getting the crap beaten out of you...
They got tired of hitting me. We should be safe for the moment.
It just kept trying to destroy me.
Judging from how your whole body is shivering, it must be your first time doing this. Editor is FAPFAPFAPPING
Depending on the problem, a specially person like me may be able tocan help.
but if you keep eating this, your tongue will lose its sense.
I won't let you lay a finger on my mistress!
You all look great in yukatas. overlap
Watching fireworks on a southern island is pure extravagance, isn't it, Beni?
I can't do that!
If you win, they'll be released from their debt.G: changing you to they, talking to Shinra about Beni and Natose
No way!
Miyu-chan, that's tickling tickles.
Miyu put a specially-made anti-rust sunblock oil on me!
No! S-Stop it,this Mistress Yume!
Give me a discount, or one for free.
You're a typical stupid Japanese who thinks everywhere is so safe.
Wanna hang out with me?
Just be quiet and listen.
According to her, she had lost her parents, placement check
You're just stingy, aren't you?
We won't do anything to this girl.
You're the idiot! aho ha socchi darou
It seems like you guys failed.
Hey, Beniko.
You're way too stupid, you siscon!
What's the matter?
Cooking was one of the first things I learned.
Stealing...
I thought I had no choice, that I'd do anything at all to live on--
He ate my dishes and told me that he was looking for a talent like myself.
Shinra-sama gave me the joy of feeling needed.
Ah, I got beaten so hard my head's spinning.
Let my song lull you!
Onee-chan's secret tool, hairpin.
Huh?
Indeed!
Hey, Uesugi.
Good morning.
She should be here any--
Well, I ended up staying late.
You'll be late if you don't hurry.
Stop doing SM play with the sun!
That's Shinra-sama's boxed lunch!
Miss, you should sleep properly in your bed if you're sleepy.
I'm the local monster Kuman!
Are you all right?
Let's leave these obvious things aside and run away.
Your attack has no effect on me.
The battle with the local monster has heated up further!
I'll accept that, but don't you think there's something else you need to do?
Know who you're dealing with!
W-What a convenient, self-serving fantasy!
I'm actually very good at picking mushrooms!
In that case... how about acting cuter? Revenant: Added Then... how aobut acting cute?
Hato Chop!
Ouch!
But how should I act cute?
No impact at all...
Follow your own way of living.
Crying and saying "don't insult me" like that, goodness, how loli, how cute!
Then what about you, do you have any ideas?
Oh my, Yume-san.
You must use a land animal!
She's really good at this.
Well, that's true, but...
Huh? Salty water is flowing from my eyes...
Taking someone else's path is no good, after all!
Haste will only make waste.T: you can change it to literal tl if you want.
Your charisma lies in giving others the desire to support you.
Will I be able to start a company with a hundred thousand employees?
Yeah, yeah.
Yo. I see you've gotten used to your work.
That aside, Mistress Yume, did you forget anything else?
I'm not that clumsy.
My... She's shining!
Y-Yume!way too early, this one is for the y-y-y-y-y-y
I-I-I'm off.
I'm sad when Yume is sad...
That's Shinra-sama's boxed lunch!
Wow! It's full of text!
I kill cool guys and give money to the ugly.
Just stop him!k: um...
Got it, Onee-chan. k: um...
The battle with the local monster has heated up further!
How much?
Indeed! I hope you'll really think about it!
Pl... Please do your best for her. T: This seems to be the most appropriate; Revenant: Added the delayed she..she..as well
I'm actually very good at picking mushrooms!
Totally on purpose, wasn't it!? No accident, your hand didn't slip!
Hey, bring the crowbar over, I'm going to hack a hole in their skulls!
Don't insult me while summing things up...
You could be daring and wear sports attire all the time, perhaps?
I don't want to be the bloomer character!
That sounds nice, I'll try that.
Oh my, Yume-san.
She's really good at this.
My sister's going to take away my role!
Yu-Yume!
This is my love, a twisted love.
Well, that's true, but...
That's right, I might as well let myself stay unnoticed,
That is not all.
Yup, that's right.
Yeah, you're right.
Of course. Actually, right now, of the three sisters, you're the one I wish to serve. Revenant: Changed the , at the end to . Also changed the sentence to sound right, I hope..sannin should mean three sisters
I-Is that so... Revenant: Added I-
Yup, take your time to think.
The Sun... sure is huge...
Y-Yeah, who knows... Revenant: Added M-
Natose-san...
Looks like the problem's solved, that's good.
Yo. I see you've gotten used to your work.
Hey, Yume! You forgot your boxed lunch again!
Stop doing SM play with the sun!
My... She's shining!
Y-Your panties...
That only applies to you!
Yume Note?
Oh, just an ally of justice.
Are you all right?
It's just you being too radiant.
100 yen for me!
Mi... Miracle... Revenant: Splitted the line, added Mi... miracle...from Haruhi lawl
Just a little.
Super Magical Girl, Yume Dream!
It's the same as the commercial! But the sequence wasn't used? TLCCCC
How much?
If we discuss it earnestly, I'm very, VERY sure we can find your personality!! joc: split and use alpha timing
Minor.
Sorry, I think my hand slipped... Check please, and the following 2 as welljoc: no idea for this
S-She's pretty good... Revenant: Added Y-
Nice one, Natose.
Well then, I'll show you the proper behavior for a cute girl.
Then... how about acting bad? Revenant: Added ...
Acting bad...
Hey, bring the crowbar over, I'm going to hack a hole in their skulls!
Follow your own way of living.
Mihato.
W-What? Revenant: Added W-
I...It doesn't seem like a bad idea... Revenant: Added I... 
This is my love, a twisted love.
Well, that's true, but...
and make that my unique point, how about that?
That's naive of you.
I was also there when you were pantyless this morning.
That's amazing, I didn't notice at all.
Yeah, you're right.
Someday, you'll become a striking character whom everyone will envy.
The Sun... sure is huge...
Eh? Are you running from reality?
Y-Yeah, yes, definitely, probably... Revenant: Added ...probably tabun
Where's Yume? We have club activities today.
She should be here any--
Well, I ended up staying late.
That's mean of you, Ren-kun.
I've also checked thoroughly.
Y-Yume!way too early, this one is for the y-y-y-y-y-y
I-I-I'm off.
Yumecchi! This is your boxed lunch!
This is Yumecchi's!
Everything for Mistress Yume's sake, right?
Note: This is a parody of Death Note.
So she had something like this...
What is this?!
Oh no
Someone help me
I kill the smart, and give money to the slow.
I have undergone training.
Oh! I found a 100-yen coin! Revenant; Corrected a typo; foudn
Yume's transformation!
Even commercials are included in Mistress Yume's fantasies.
All those who disrupt peace shall be punished by me, Yume.
She's too cute, damn it!
W-What a convenient, self-serving fantasy!
Hato Chop!
Then... how about acting bad? Revenant: Added ...
What? No way! But I still have...
She... disappeared!
But if any of you were to mimic it...
Yeah, you are right.
Yu-Yume!
This is my love, a twisted love.
In the first place, personality isn't something that asking others can help with.
Well, that's true, but...
"Someday"... When is that?
"I wish I had it too," I think...
Yup, take your time to think.
Y-Yeah, who knows... Revenant: Added M-
Will Natose-san always be by my side and back me up?
I hope you'll continue to work hard for my sake.
You can't without my permission...
Even though Mihato is superior at Japanese dishes, Beni is the best at making Italian dishes.
What the hell is this?
Is the guest related to Colonel?
So because of these circumstances,
I haven't forgotten about you, Yume.
Unfortunately I can't give you what you like, Shinra-dono.
Panda!
Sister!
We're the glass teens!
W-well it's not that bad. Added W- ; reve
...make yourself comfortable.
As my Mistress hath ordered, I shalt serve you with all I've got,
Not like that, but like this!
Yes, Ageha-sama!
After your dinner, let's bath together.
I really miss Ageha-sama's punch...
You can't even do a landing, you are pathetic. TLCthe manzoku thingy prolly needs to be added
if you follow my training, you will be able to jump down easily from there.
That punch was pretty good.
We are actually successors of an enterprise which involves military steel.
But this is my destiny, I have to become strong no matter what.
One... no, two people?
Their target would be me, who left the Kuki Family.
With a light poke, she will fall asleep very soon. T: Sleeping Beauty?
Assassins?
Miyu-chan...T: Forget about your brother and go the yuri route!
Yes, Ageha-sama!
This is the last one!
That's what happened.
And what happened to Kojuurou?
Thus we decided to take care of her for a while.
You sure did a good check about what everyone likes.
I was able to get them from a certain country I was staying at.
You can stay as long as you want in this house.
You, just do it.
D-D-Don't tell me.
And don't forget the tripod!
Ren,
Dirt spotted!
Yeah.
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and come!
If you want to go, please do.
You can't even do a landing, you are pathetic. TLCthe manzoku thingy prolly needs to be added
I'm fine, I'm fine.
The elderly are assets of the country.
We are actually successors of an enterprise which involves military steel.
I really admire you.
But then, it's a waste to use this pair of beautiful hands to fight.
Ageha-sama...
My "guests" have arrived, please don't interfere!
Who are these guys?
Ren-chan?
Oh no, even 0.1 gram of this will let a whale sleep too.
Your little brother will become a man like this someday.
This is killing me!
Ren-chan...
We'll talk right after that.
Aren't you glad, Ageha-chan?
Then, with this...
Understood!
I'm going to prepare a special meal tonight for Ageha-sama.
Get Ren to give me some milk coffee.
You are a true friend!
Ageha-sama! Let's return home together!
Ageha-sama!
As I thought, Ageha-sama has changed...
If you don't try, nothing will ever happen.
Ren-chan, this is your first time cooking, right?
Yes.
It's all thanks to your teaching.
Loyalty to a master is a genuine thing that exceeds mere passion or love!aruji no chuuseishin to ai dano koi dano deha kataganai shinsei na mono nanda
This hand of mine glows with an awesome power!
Become the light!
Aren't you punching the wrong person?
but to even run wild with violence and heap abuse with your tongue.
Last!
First match winner: Ren!
Ren immediately gets one point.
Here are your dessert seconds.
....since I'm on a diet.
Kojuurou is leading all of a sudden!
Good luck, Kojuurou-kun!
Hey, are you...
With this I'm done with everything...
I haven't given up on you yet, Ren.
But to think that club activities and garden tending are the only things I have to do sounds pretty dull, right?
Don't be too concerned. Until you get used to things, it can't be helped.
I ask for permission to take him to the training camp.
I bet there's lots of delicious food.
Are you supposed to be elated?!
I'll take care of it at once.
And right beside me, wearing a swimsuit is...
Wow, it sure is a wonderful sight, isn't it?
Shinra-sama...
Yeah, she's definitely not the ordinary type.
Huh?
Don't look this way!
Kurukkuu...
Nee-san.
I'll give you this as well.
"The Butler's Den"?
Ageha-sama.
Is it okay for us to join your training?
It feels good for some reason.
Don't make your elbow leave the left side of your body, and push forward at an interior angle.
Good. Next.
W-What kind of monsters?
Um, for instance...
B-But...
Leave it to me!
A-Ageha-san, what are you doing?
Kojuurou made it to 300.
N-No, my money is for the food I just ate.
Oh, it's Ren-kun...
The mere thought of a monster appearing is so terrifying, I can't sleep.
Here, this is yours, Ren-kun.
There's no way you have the guts to make an advance towards me, Ren.
Ah, I can't get enough of this cuddly sensation!
It's an ecstacy of black and white.
I shall reward you.
Your sister is very skilled.
Here's your tea.
and the smart Ren.
Ageha-sama...
who fight for humanity itself.
Are you jealous?
I heard that Ageha-sama had not returned even though it was past the scheduled date,
She trained me through harsh days!
Certainly, she's really strict.
Ageha-sama...
Without even punching me...
We really have to do something.
Ren-chan...
I know how you feel.
G-G-Goodnight!
It's the third one today!
Ageha-sama...
Its blazing light screams for me to defeat you!
You fool!
but to even run wild with violence and heap abuse with your tongue.
Such offences are beyond difficult to forgive!
Fool! You who treacherously stole someone important from me -- I will open your eyes! Fool!tlc pleasex: tack on: ,you who steals important people from others!
Oh look, if you don't hurry you'll lose.
Compared to Ren who carries each piece at full speed, Kojuurou is slow but carries two at a time.
It's just your imagination! Good luck!
It's good that his injuries have healed, isn't it?
Kojuurou! Kojuurou! Kojuurou! Kojuurou!
Why is everyone against me?
Kojuuro, you weren't fully healed?
Such a reckless person.
Ren, is my milk coffee still not here?
This isn't like me... Maybe I should go cool my head down.
By the way, what are your plans for tomorrow?
That's all.
Shinra-sama, we should be leaving soon.
Right then, I'm off to my battlefield.
You've become so considerate too.
T-This isn't too rough, is it?
We are master and servant, so it'll be a problem if you get embarrassed.
Starting tomorrow, do your duties properly.
Poke!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
If things were as simple as that, we wouldn't need laws... Right?
Acting like an older sister in the morning, how cheeky.
Oh?
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me being a servant!
For now, I'll take your cell phone as an apology.
What should we do Beni... shouldn't we stop them?
Thanks for saving me!
So you were a good person!
Miyu-san isn't just playing.
Hmm... Let's see...
Your father, famous in the business world, and also for his environmental and philanthropic activities,
My dream hasn't changed,
When the person in front of us at the cashier is taking his time with his coins...
I'm sure it'll be like that.
The rest will be on the CD.
Sis!
Ah, sigh.
What exactly does Miyu-san do everyday?
This bra for today, alright?
Um-- what-- yes, I mean...no! Well...eh?
A, Ageha, Ageha...
Let's see... tomorrow's schedule is...
I was able to scrub her back properly without getting embarrassed today!
I-I can't sleep!
No matter how smart she is, a little sister is still a little sister.
Yeah...
Educational guidance!
His battery ran out?
I see now...
Alright poke
Your father, famous in the business world, and also for his environmental and philanthropic activities,
What do you think of him?
Nanahama Philharmonic's coming collaboration will be conducted by Kuonji Shinra-san, idol of the classical world.
I wonder if it's because of her job.
Even though your performance is close, you've been quite busy with interviews lately.
What was that attitude?
My, my, what would she be like if she went astray?
we'll just cut the connection...
I'm sure it'll be like that.
What should we do?
Here's the first song!
The rest will be on the CD.
I love Miyu, so I have to persuade her to come around.
Wait a moment.
All the servants treasure Miyu-san, whether they're assigned to her or not.
Who is the master of this house, Ren?
Save me, my prince on a white horse!
Securing the house...
This bra for today, alright?
Starting tomorrow, do your duties properly.
It isn't bad having a pure boy attend to me.
Good morning, Miyu-san.
Morning.
Then, what's your dream?
I can see everything...
To get recharged at home.
I can't control myself, oh those curves!
Educational guidance!
When you're Miyu's personal attendant, you're my subordinate!
We shouldn't get involved with idiots.
It ended while you were recharging.
Since we're friends already.
You're in the way if you just stand there!
What should I do?
What do you think of him?
Do you also plan on devoting your efforts to such areas, and not merely to music?
Her mood was probably marred by her talking more about Father than herself.
Maybe you should take a break.
Since we're at it, just go with the red door!
we'll just cut the connection...
Next is IQ240! Let's go!
A break?
I see. Good luck.
Love is a selfish thing!
But right now you're my personal attendant!
Hey, someone help me!
It seems like a white horse or something has been requested.
and very nutritious to boot.
What exactly does Miyu-san do everyday?
U-Understood!
A, Ageha, Ageha...
Yes?
Alright...
I couldn't finish the work I need to hand in...
Can you finish something that quickly if you haven't been able to finish it yet?
Just obediently respect your older sister and accept her benevolence.
I'm going.
You're just a low-ranking servant, and you dare eavesdrop on my private matters?
Wait!
It's your fault!
It ended while you were recharging.
So you were a good person!
Since we're friends already.
I see now...
Uh y-y-yes.
If you speak like that, no matter how long passes, you'll never change at all.
Hmm... Let's see...
Here you go.
Oh, it's Shinra-sama.
I wonder if it's because of her job.
Here's the first song!
Twin-tails makes it! joc: twin-tail tsukurunda? TLC meeded
Something like that?
I'm going to take a part-time job!
Come on, let's eat...
Save me, my prince on a white horse!
Shin-oneechan, why do you only lavish attention on Miyu-oneechan?
Even though I'm your sister, you never hug me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Yume...
That's all I want.
Yume!
Have the spirit of a challenger, Yume!
Did I come in the middle of something?
What's wrong, Yume?
Yume...
Shin-oneechan?
Sorry for letting you suffer all those lonely feelings.
I thought only about Mama and Papa, but...
I only widened the distance between us.
I wanted to calm down by admiring some flowers...
Wait, Shin-oneechan.
I'm sorry for not remembering!
My age is irrelevant.
When did you...?
All humanity will kneel before me,
and will clean every corner of the entire world!
Yume, it's me. Please open up.
If even Sis is down, I'll be sad too.
Natose-san...
That sounds like what a stubbornly traditional old man would say.
Her wallet is gone too.
When?
In the first place, this is...
I will too!
Shinra-sama, you shouldn't quarrel with her over something trivial like this!
That's right, I'm sure you'd regret it.
Did Miyu-san send you here?
Want to come in?
The night view sure is beautiful, huh?
It seems like you and Shinra-sama don't know many things about each other.
It's not too late!
A great tsunami struck, and I was the only survivor in my family.
I couldn't protect anyone.
It seems that Ren and Natose forgot their cell phones.
Really, if it's been left to those two, there's no need to worry.
Hato-nee told me the same thing before.
You're scary!
I'm glad.
Now, tell her your true feelings!
in order to not shame her wonderful father whom so many people respected,
Right now, Yume is older than Nee-san was at that time.
Yeah.
Could you step away?
I'm sorry...
Can we sleep together tonight? We haven't in a while.
Of course!
Benisu-san, let's work hard together!
Everyone's appearing in the second half!
Let's go for it!
Why?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Yume...
I am as well.
It seems that I was too concerned about what you said in the past.
I thought only about Mama and Papa, but...
What is it?
Yume, so that's how insignificant I actually am to you.
Mistress Yume.
T-That's true...
If you told Ren-chan anything unnecessary...
...become a big shot whom nobody can ignore any longer!
She told me to leave her alone, and didn't say anything more.
we can bring her her food when we check on her later.
She ran away from home?
And she's never gone out without telling me before.
Hato-forehead-poke!
It's not the time to argue!
Even though you already lost your parents in an accident,
Even though it's such a warm home...
...for sisters to do this...
Congratulations, Yume.
Today... it's something else.
Want to come in?
Yume!
Is that so?
Apparently we often visited this place...
Yeah.
To your family?
If you're that worried, maybe you shouldn't have quarreled in the first place.
In my whole time working for her,
It reminds me there is still someone I can protect.
Hato-nee told me the same thing before.
At that time... you seemed really reliable to me.
And you've been worrying about them all this time, right?
Yume!
It's fine now, Yume.
I... joc: TIMING FIX
Natose-san is the precious guardian watching over our family!
The ball hit somebody.
You have to compensate us for this.
One of the elegant jobs of a superior is to look after one's subordinates.
But, I'm looking forward to the cherry blossom viewing, Haru.
Haru, I'll say this first: We all support you no matter what.
Something terrible might happen when the law fails though.
No way, it's not me right?
She's strong and dependable.
Yeah, yeah. I understand it well.
For example, push her down suddenly!
Simply put, you need to take her to a place she likes.
Alright! An illegal pitch!
I want to bring that Ren here and make him do wonderful things like this.
Benisu-san...
Now, Benisu-san, it's the next batter!
How was last night?
Your sense is the worst.
No, it seems that Natose-san has picked up an amusing American joke.
Because it's funny, right?
Now, do it swiftly.
In my girlfriend's room, she started taking off her clothes and told me "I'll give you anything you want."
Stop him, Ren!
A uniform doesn't suit an adult like me!
H-hey, let go!
What a tragic guy.
You fool, don't use such a dangerous move here!
Don't say dangerous things!
To steal while everyone's having fun...
Punishment complete.
It's not bad to walk with everyone in order to sober up.
Oh? Then, should I go in with you?
Ren-chan, the Kuonji house is a really nice place right?
You're someone who doesn't know how to read the atmosphere, eh.
Soon it will be time for cherry blossom viewing, I'm looking forward to it!
Why did you come in here to talk about it?
I'll wash your back so please let me continue, Ren-nii.
Now, let's go in!
Ren-nii!
Are you worried about something?
I know what Chiharu-kun is thinking about right now.
Eh? I'd like to know.
No way.
Please, please do it!
So, who is it?
As I thought, it's me!
How about a ramen tour?
Round and round and round and round... go!
Yo.
You're really pathetic.
That's right, I'll work too!
Ha ha ha, my calcium has risen!
I'm in despair!
I'm in despair because my robot bites the hand that made him!
Because it's funny, right?
It cost a hundred thousand dollars right?
Everyone's giving me that dead look.
I'm sorry, Yume.
Yeah! I feel like my brain is going numb!
The Kuonji Sisters' cosplay show!
Well, I just wanted to see Myu-tan cosplay.
Is she just kicking the iron pole?
I didn't mean it like that.
Amazing, Ageha-chan!
That's nice... I want to be spun around too.
Sorry, sorry.
Ah! Thieves!
Alright, leave it to me.
Yet you still perform such regrettable acts like stealing.
What a child.
I've finally found you.
So you were in a place like that.
It's a good view right, Shinra-sama?
Put it back in the car.
From that mountain to that mountain there, Shinra-sama bought all of it with her pocket money in order to conserve the environment.
Amazing!
Yeah.
Yes!
Now, let's make you beautiful.
You are a quick learner, and you remember the preferences of the masters very quickly.
Right now, he still has a large existence for the people who know him.live inside the people he know
It's because I'm weak... That's all there is to it!
Well, there's that too...
That will be it.
Ren-chan, good work.
No matter how busy Shinra-sama's schedule is, she always reserves time for her family.
As I thought, sushi from Tokyo is the best!
My skills should be better than before.
Leave me.
Will you go on a date with me?
You're very good when you're having fun with music.
I never thought it'd be you to remind me.
But, I'm not putting on such an expression.
Panda!
I didn't have to worry about my home, critics, sponsors or anything else.
That's, well... since it's a date, lasting impressions are important.
I see.
Don't say such irresponsible things!
The things your father did doesn't matter!
Shinra-sama, I just want...
Shinra-sama!
You?
Here you go.
Shinra-sama!
These two belong to my family.
Bastard!
opening song
No more bets.
As expected.
Miyu-chan, you're tickling me!
Since you have a pretty skin...
You must take good care of it.
If you get carried away, things will get dangerous.
They say there's a monster that pulls people to the bottom of the ocean.
Yume Ojou-sama... Yume Ojou-sama...
You should try to find something you can be proud of.
Then, I'll come back another day!
Well, there was this native girl I met at the market...
Although it was my job to confirm the security of wherever Shinra-sama stopped by...
Not you again...
That idiot!
Well, it's not that we have to, right?
Well, you have my sympathies.
Not cute at all, dirty with money, and without the least bit of tenderness.
Ren-chan was abducted?
In order for a child to live on her own, you had to be strong.
I studied hard.
Pervert.
Shut up! It's none of your business...
If you eat these kind of things, your taste buds will die.
Depending on your skills, I may hire you as a chef.
I will eradicate the filth from this world!
It seems like you've been taking care of Beni and Ren.
Onee-chan's secret tool:
As reward for saving a butler from the Kuonji family...
Open your eyes for the next Kimiaru.
It's cold!
Isn't it part of the Kuonji estate?
Y-yes!
That's right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ren will be with me for a bit.
Then for the promotions of the ones concerned at regular intervals, you'll have a recording for TV programs.
Y-yes!
He's really strict, but really...
My beloved sisters!
I kind of understand.
To put it simply, you were better in your student years.
There was nothing in your performance that could touch the heart.
Hey, what are you saying to Shinra-sama you old man?! Ossan old man, kurowassan croissant, if you needed a note for it or something.
I'm envious enough that she can get onto the newspaper.
I want to concentrate.
I think a change of pace will be good for you.
Panda!
Here, a candy as your consolation prize.
A commander should bet his life and take responsibility!
Wait a moment, Shinra-sama!
I won't catch a cold with a small breeze like this.
Could I...
Easily said than done.
Did you forget how to talk to your father?
Shinra-sama, good morning.
Father... huh?
Shinra-sama.
I think I got carried away and got Shinra-sama mad.
My son and daughter are both being taken care of, joc: timing ends too early
We should have fun together as a family of three again.
I, um...
Nee-san.
I'm not wearing any undies at the moment. w00t!
That's not what Myu-tan does!
For you to be rejecting my temptation, you've really changed.
Both you and Yume, why are you going to this extent?
shouldering so many heavy burdens alone.
This is like being in heaven!
That was an appropriate decision.
I've got to protect them from him.
Hato-nee, and everyone else in this house.
Shinra-sama's concert is tomorrow evening.
Yo!
His strange behaviour might be due to that guy's presence.
Please go back!
I...
When I was a kid, I thought that some day, you'd turn over a new leaf.
Let's go, Ren.
What a sad person.
I'm so sorry to make such a request just before the performance.
What's wrong, Beni?
Yo!
Shinra-sama, it is about time to set off.
Alright.
so give me a call on my cellphone, joc: timing - starts too early
Why... do I have such a father?
Really, nothing happened.
Sorry, Hato-nee.
In the Kuonji family, as long as you're recognised as part of the family,
We won't try anything risky this time,
S-Stop it!
That's not what Myu-tan does!
For you to be rejecting my temptation, you've really changed.
I've changed?
You understand my feelings?
Thank goodness, Ren-kun!
Thanks everyone!
Look at me and answer.
Shinra-sama's concert is tomorrow evening.
Dad!
He's worse than what I've been told.
Ren!
That was what I wanted to say!
Beni!
You brat!
You're not different.
Keh! Do whatever you like.
I'm going to pay you back for what you did to me earlier!
Beni, teach him the consequences of making a mark on your skin.
Yes!
Shin onee-chan! Good luck!
De Niro, teach him a lesson.
N-No!
A-ge-ha-sa-ma-
What are you saying in all this confusion?
A battle to be the queen?
Yo!
Its delicious!
M-Morning!
Brighter than usual!
H-Huh?!
Checking out on personal items is a retinue's duty, you know!
Huh? What is this notebook?
For Yume Ojou-sama to have such a thing.
I'm Kumaan, a local monster!
I kill the handsome and give money to the ugly.
Zusha.
I'm envious of you!
In that case, it's my turn.
You're not allowed to do that!
Watch Yume's transformation.
Ultra magical girl, Yume Dream!
It's the same as the commercial! Hey, are you re-using the sequences?
However, you won't escape capital punishment!
Tell it to everybody and ask for their cooperation!
I thought it would be good for everyone to discuss on how to bring out Yume Ojou-sama's personality.
You're pretty much fired up.
Hato chop!
I-Impressive...
The other day I was chased by a pink elephant at Kujuukuri!
I'm going to open a hole in your head!
No one can stop us!
Something like that.
You should have second thoughts on drastically altering your appearance.
That sounds great. Let me try it.
I'm going to compete using a terrestrial animal!
For an elder sister to steal her sibling's position...
She must overcome it by herself.
Ah... I couldn't help running away, but...
This is the first time I see you today.
Wow, to think there was a professional in this field as well.
Don't rush things, Yume.
I can't help being panicky.
Your charisma is the feeling of wanting to follow up on you, Ojou-sama.
Too huge.
Yes, for sure... I think.
Yume, you're such a ...
This is a reward from your master.
Way to go, Yume!
I'm looking forward to it.
Kimiaru ep.7 avant 9, A 22
Shinra-sama, it's about time you wake up...
Since when did you grow so much, Miyu-tan?
Bad girl, without my permission...
Intruders!
opening song
According to the doctors, it'll require about three months for him to recover completely.
But I wasn't informed about renovating the mansion.
The renovation costs and restoration fee will be paid by the Kuki family of course.
Oh, that's right.
I have things to hand out to everyone.
You can stay as long as you desire.
If it's okay with the masters, then that might be a good idea.
You received gold?
My...
Am I supposed to take care of Ageha-san?!
Oh, about that.
Oh!
Yes, you have passed.
Ah, once we get back, we'll start our training.
Say "ah."
There's no need to feel daunted.
Right, that was good.
I'll be all right.
Ah... no... it's just that...
I'm not letting you escape.
Ageha-san!
I'm full to my stomach!
I see, a rival company's...
Miyu-chan...
Ageha-sama, I, Kojuurou will welcome you back home!
Aren't you glad, Ageha-chan?
A-Ageha-sama?
Sorry, but I have work to do, so I'm going back home.
Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!
Ren's first kiss?
As I thought!
What are you doing?!
And strict towards others.
Oh, so you've been accompanying Ageha-sama with her training.
Besides, I haven't done anything much.
Give me a break.
Are you trying to win over my conscience?
Yume Ojou-sama. Ageha-sama.
Um... that is... A-Ageha-sama...
It's not sharp!
Ren-chan...
Um... such as where?
Thanks to your guidance, Ageha-sama.
The token of loyalty.
get kicked by a horse and go to hell!
Glistening and yelling to defeat you!
Ma'am!
If you got the message, then leave at once.
What?
You fool!
You can't order me around!
Come on, if you don't hurry up, you're going to lose.
Kojuurou is carrying two baggages at a slow pace.
This is to retrieve Ren-chan.
Oh, thanks, Ren-kun!
Natose-san, you're not supposed to thank him.
Kojuurou has now taken a decisive lead!
The third match will test your loyalty towards your master. The master's trivia quiz!
With my pride on the line now, I defintely can't lose.
Kojuurou.
I'm on my way!
A-Ageha-sama...
What else?
What does Miyu-san do everyday?
Good morning.
Come on, Miyu-chan, banzai!
Mihato is very attentive which helps me greatly.
Right, I'm off to my battlefield.
What is today's schedule?
Miyu-san didn't go outside at all.
Ren, you must get ready yourself.
And what must I get ready for...
Yes, very well!
My story until I came here isn't anything pleasant to hear about.
Then, I guess it can't be helped, you naughty boy.
Yume, is anything wrong?
Nee-san, you're the one who should act like and elder and control yourself.
Hold it right there!
Since we're friends now!
You just came at the right time.
Huh? S-Sure.
Come on, move it.
Yume...
Yes, however, I will focus my attention on music for now.
Tou-sama was really a wonderful person.
I lost ten life points!
I bet it's your taste.
Don't get in the way, Ren!
Since it must have been so tough for Miyu-san until now, she's simply taking a break.
And?
an8This is my dream.
Yume is going to do part time work!
By the way, Miyu-tan, even if you start a business, you better be home when I want to see you.
You're starting to contradict yourself!
And who is the master of this house, Ren?
What the master owns is the master's, what her sister owns is also the master's.
Yume?
I think she's requesting for a white horse.
Yume... Yume is your sister too, so how come you don't embrace me?
Imagining it just makes me cry.
Shin Onee-chan, why do you show affection only towards Miyu Onee-chan?
Shin Onee-chan?
I wanted to embrace you, too.
Do you really not remember it?
To think what I went through all these years because of that!
Beni-kou, that's not funny.
I was thinking of caressing flowers to soothe my heart, but...
Yume...
Should I go and tell her: "To be quarreling is proof of your existence"?
I feel sad if Onee-chan isn't cheerful, too.
Since when?
I don't know.
Don't say such ominous things.
A huge tsunami came, where I was the sole survivor of my family.
I cursed my weakness.
Shinra-sama...
It's hard just to watch without getting involved, but...
Huh? Yume didn't do anything.
That's why I was able to work hard for Yume's sake.
I know it may be painful, but try to remember.
Yume...
The Nee-san back then...
Anyone can make mistakes.
Natose-san...
I know it must be hard on you.
If you talk to her properly, Shinra-sama will definitely understand.
So Miyu-chan, you were always concerned about them, being caught in the middle.
Yume is always being supported by Natose-san!
You guys, go for it!
Because... Because... cant exclaim here
Huh? No one's home?
Um...
Wait a minute!
What? You pervert.
Kouichi!
Kouichi!
Sanada Kouichi.
Aihara Kazuki.
They're still in France. I'm the only one who came back.
I want to go to a Japanese high school, too.
But really, you've become very pretty, Mao-chan.
Because around the time we were in middle school...
Mao-neechan!
By the way, why did you come here, Kazuki?
I'm your opponent, the warrior of love and healing, the masked bear.
I can't understand what you're trying to say.
Well, he did get those suits himself.
All right, I've decided.
Hey, let's go to sleep, Mao-neechan.
Can't it go any faster?! Ah, I'm being passed again!
You're just a cheeky brat!
So sleepy...
Today is opening day, though.
What are you saying?
It's been a while.
Sanada, is this beauty your acquaintance?
I'm currently staying at Sanada-kun's house.
Huh?
Well, I couldn't really find one.
You must be joking.
S-Something like that.
Tell me your name!
Kai-kun, huh?
Jan Ken Pon!
All right! I won!
You came to give it back?
Why a zero?
There's no real meaning to it.
An experiment.
Kyouichi and Kazuki didn't change very much.
What's with that out-of-tune noise?
Stop!
No way...
Kouichi!
Morning.
Ah, okay.
It's really unusual for you to wake up early and help my mom.
Not really.
Thanks for coming along.
No...
Did I look so down?
Auntie!
I'm home...
Well, I thought it'd stop soon,
Tomorrow?
You should get yourself together too.
Cold medicine...
Yeah, Kouichi?
What a coincidence, me too.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd stop by.
It's already been decided.
It's nothing.
It's a funeral.
You don't need to do anything unnecessary either.
The whole time...
Welcome to my home!
It seems like Shijou-san had already invited her by the time I called her.
We're in the same class, so there was no real reason to refuse.
We'll just look around at random, then.
What are you looking at?
It's a maculata.
With Hoshino-san, of course!
That's not true!
F-Forget about me!
Wow!
please have a taste.
Well then, they'll get cold,
It's good!
What are the ingredients in this soup? It's really good!
It's passable.
Um...
Isn't it?
Is something wrong?
I want to play some more with everyone!
Agreed!
Oh, I got red.
One!
They've finished counting.
M-Me?
So you have!
You didn't look well during the meal.
Ah, yeah, I'm fine now.
Hoshino-san sure is slender.
Let's go look over there.
Asking them personally is a bit hard.
She's a bit better than when we first met her, though.
You're always fighting with Futami-san.
It's also pretty fun when I'm with her.
So, how is it?
I thought it was a real bother for you to be with everyone.
What about you, Aihara?
It was I who suggested that we restart it-
The biggest problem is the cast, though.
The cooking at Shijou-sempai's place was really good!
I've got to do my best and make delicious udon!
What's wrong? Did something happen after all?
You will have a calm and quiet day.
Are you a Capricorn, Kouichi?
No, that's not what I mean.
Ah, wait, hold it!
I forgot something.
Oh yeah, it's almost summer vacation!
Did something good happen to you?
Well, this is what happens when I become even a bit serious. Structure
Not bad either, I guess.
You saw the announcements?
That's still amazing.
Oh, this is good!
How was it different?
It's nothing.
you can leave first, Kai-kun.
It's not really coming together.
Oh? I won't lose either!
so let's go there.
I borrowed it.
Leaving that aside, money!
I was in such a rush that I didn't bring my wallet!
I'm glad he's a nice doctor.
Why are you being so formal?
We won't be able to see each other?
Hoshino-san...
Asuka-chan!
Cheer up, okay?
Get better with this!
You can't do that, Nana.
Sorry that we didn't notice it sooner.
So you like her.
Aren't you going anywhere with your family or something?
Geez...
Hey, you're lagging behind, defense!
Aihara!
You'll know soon enough.
You're always deciding things like that.
What is?
It's been a while since I rode one.
I should make this clear.
Why did I remember that at a time like this?!
When couples ride it together, they say that they won't ever separate.
The sea...
Let's eat!
This is good!
Do you want to go now?
Here.
This is it.
I'm glad.
No...
Plans for summer, huh?
Twenty-thousand yen?!
We won't feel as lonely, then.
We can go to the beach anytime! Isn't there someplace-
Yes!
I'll be playing.
It's kind of amazing when someone you know is in a live show.
It's really great though, huh, Kai-kun?
I'll be okay. I'll just eat what's here.
It's me.
Let's conduct the experiment at another date.
Just play like you did during practice!
Thank you very much!
Hello.
Kai-san's pretty amazing.
Whoa, what's all this?
Please do it.
Hoshino-san is-
I thought about a few places, but I have no money.
I'll be looking forward to them, okay?
You should act a bit more shocked there, Hoshino-san.
The truth is I love you!
I see.
First of all, it's this guy's fault for being absurd and asking you.
It's a dish for Satonaka's summer menu.
Here you go, you two!
Good work.
I would have felt bad for interfering with your practice.
I'm just talking about whether she'll accept or not.
Tomorrow?
He's always leaving me in the blue.
Good luck!
You're worrying about it too much.
I told you I can't act.
Pretty good, Kouichi!
I see...
We're just going out shopping.
Kouichi wrote a pretty good script.
But it was that, so...
You being so cheerful.
I want to etch it onto my heart...
My legs have recovered, and now I can practice again!
Mizusawa?
"Now's the Time." The moment is now.
What are you doing?
Your band members are calling you.
Okay.
I'll call you again later.
Really? Good work.
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.
Cut!
Your acting was perfect, Mizusawa-sempai!
Yeah.
Ready.
Ready, start!
Were you waiting for a call?
Sorry about that, Iwao-kun!
Okay, just leave them around there.
Sorry, were you waiting?
The number you are trying to reach is out of range,
Why have you been worrying about your phone the entire time?
A-Ah, yeah.
Did you do anything that would make her hate you?
Futami-san...
Why do people love?
Kissing.
Why Aihara-kun?
And you're doing experiments?!
Oh yeah, there's a bakery that just opened that has a lot of cakes.
I can't trick myself anymore.
Recently, Mao-neechan has been going out every day.
and when she gets home, she locks herself in her room.
I've got to treasure Hoshino-san.
Coming!
Aihara-kun really cares for you!
O-Okay.
Hey, did you put it on?
It isn't really my thing, though.
Do you like me?
No, nothing.
Geez, why are you crying, Kouichi?
What is it?
I've always wanted to read this.
Thank you!
Yeah.
Yes!
Ah, hello? Shijou-san?
You want to go back to Japan by yourself first?
That's true, but...
We finally meet.
It just happened to get in my luggage.
I do understand.
Hey, hey, let's light up some fireworks!
It's done already.
Um...
I'm sorry, Kai-kun.
Weren't you with her?
She said she had something to do, so she left first.
I hope she doesn't get soaked because of the rain.
She has a pretty bad fever.
Forget it and bring some towels, Kouichi.
I wish we could have a longer vacation.
Like the amusement park?
Sakino!
Ah, Sakino!
The swings, huh?
You too?
Is it?
Or they thought their feelings were wrong.
In the end, people are alone. SO RONREY
Thank you.
Sanada-san.
Let me take a small break.
No, you don't need to apologize.
You should be serious like that all the time.
Futami-san told me bluntly that the experiments are over.
I didn't want you to meet just so that could happen.  JUST ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU KEIKAKU MEANS PLAN
I'll treat you to something as thanks,
Yeah.
I've got work now.
I'm coming in.
Why?
Just leave me alone.
I'll do anything.
Why, you say?
The one I like is you, Kouichi!
M-Morning.
Our class will be doing a mini-game park.
First off, people who want to do the ten to eleven slot?
That's a problem, Aihara.
I've been interested in cooking for a while.
Let's do it! U-U-don!
Really? It's nothing.
Hurry!
I'll wait for you.
Y-Yeah, but it's just a movie, after all.
I've been thinking all this time
I've just wanted to know more about you ever since I met you,
Let's go, Sanada.
Movie Research Club?
Nice to meet you.
Okay.
Um...
Let's do our best.
Really.
Director, Hiiragi... Minmin?
Minmin is kind of cute.
We got new members, too!
It would really be better if it continued forever...
Hoshino-san?
I'm transferring the day after the school festival ends.
No way, we just became friends, too.
Yes, he said he'd come see me every week.
I'll write you letters.
When I no longer became nervous talking to others.
Everyone...
Gave me a bit of courage.
Mao-neechan...
Are you okay, Mao-neechan?
Mao-neechan.
Experiment?
What does...?
I'm starting to get the hang of it now!
I still have jet lag!
Ehh...?
Oh, that's right.
I won't let you sleep until you talk!
You're about the only person who would put that on their bag.
That's not true!
Thank you!
Could this be... that gorilla...?
She's from an honorable lineage. As a daughter of the Shijou family,
Good morning, Kuryu-san.
You know her, Hiiragi?
Furthermore, her favorite motto is,
So she's a girl! How lovely!
Futami Eriko.
Futami Eriko, a student from 2nd Year Class C.
A solitary genius girl with an IQ of 190.
It's because you overslept, Mao-neechan!
Mao-neechan!
Gather some promising freshman for me, please. grammar
It's a teamwork problem!
W-Well, we only have three members.
Look!
How observant! I'm amazed you noticed!
Please come by and eat sometime!
Sorry.
Sorry, Nana!
Do you always practice here?
If you're not taking entrance exams, what are you going to do?
I'm glad!
Why?
No, I didn't.
About...
S-Sorry.
I thought you were a freshman...
There he is!
You didn't know my name, Sanada-kun.
Nothing...
Healing Beam.
Spill it already!
S-She's just a classmate!
Ho-Hoshino...
I don't have any confidence and I don't know what to say...
If you can't say something cool, you won't be able to become a novelist.
You can forget about me.
I lost my support and my balance.
I'd just make you suffer even more if I was moping about it.
I'm all right now.
It's okay.
Love won't be born from an experiment.
Hurry and wake up, Kouichi!
I'm really sorry.
I'll go with you-
Ah, it's so cute!
Huh? Are you interested, Sakino?
I'm not really...
All right, that's enough.
What are you talking about?
Could you not understand what I said?
I'm stupid, so say it to me clearly so that I can understand it!
Let's move forward together!
What are you trying to say?
What I'm missing?
Hey, onii-chan, I'm staying over at Naru-chan's tomorrow.
That won't work.
All right, one more time.
You're a genius but you have bad taste.
Just like you said, people's feelings probably change.
And be hated...
Futami-san?
My tears just...
Why am I crying?
What's wrong, mom?
I was packing up my stuff late into the night, yesterday.
The school festival is soon, so it was our last burst towards completing our new udon.
It's our own creation!
Morning...
No, it's nothing.
Please try this!
If you'd like, could you try it, too?
Yeah, yeah!
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!
Well, that's because...
Ah, too bad.
What are you doing?
I see, so there was the editing left.
That's so sudden.
I don't want to leave behind any regrets.
He's really helpless without you around, Yuumi-chan.
for the East Kibina inter-school match at the school festival.
First, the mid-fielders.
Yajima.
I thought so. You want to step down?
Yeah.
Sakino-san, too?
I wonder if something happened?
Ah, Kouichi, I'm fine.
Hoshino-san she had to get ready to move, too,
Geez, why are you acting so sad?
You can have it.
You're taking this with you?
It'd be nice if we could start over.
Sleeping emotions are now awakening.
But, what is this pain?
Yeah.
Morning.
She's been acting weird lately.
What the heck am I doing?
It might be better than not having enough, though.
I'll go make more copies, then.
He might be feeling lonely because Hoshino-san is moving soon.
Do you want me to bring more?
Excuse me.
That's right.
You told me last time,
Yeah.
All right, I guess I'll go home and prepare for tomorrow.
so we'll meet up at Satonaka's.
You go too, Hoshino-san.
so we thought we'd hold a farewell party.
It was Shijou-sempai's idea.
It'd show on Aiihara's face, too.
We'll definitely complete our ultimate udon by tomorrow, Hoshino-sempai!
Please come by and eat it, you two.
I've got to work harder.
I'm home!
Okay, that's a promise!
I'm amazed you finished it on time.
I did it somehow.
Of course.
Sorry, I'm on the reception desk at 11.
And I have a match after that.
Wait.
You don't need to worry about me.
All right, I guess I'll go hand these out.
So, in the end, I have to do it by myself anyway.
I want to go around with Futami-san too.
Naru-chan, Naru-chan!
You're good, Kai-kun!
So cool!
What are you going to do now, Kuryuu-san?
Two, please.
I'm going to do my best.
Listen.
Asuka-sempai! move me down
Asuka turn!
Nice shot!
You played very well.
You did it, Sakino!
He said player selection!
I didn't think he'd be chosen for the starting line-up.
Ah, is it about the training camp?
You don't need to worry then, I know you can do it!
I like you, Aihara-kun!
Sakino.
Mana-chan and Ruko-chan will be back from their break soon,
Nana!
No, I'll do that later.
Have you seen Futami-san?
Futami-sempai? Did you see her, Naru-chan?
I see, I guess you were.
Could it be...
Onii-chan...
It can't be...
Welcome!
We have delicious homemade crepes in 3-C!
I forgot my cell in the crepe store.
You're alone, Yuumi-chan? Where's Kouichi?
Ah, I see.
Are you having fun?
You're moving tomorrow, after all.
Mizusawa-sempai...
Have Hoshino-san...
She tried to not hurt me...
I...
Love comes in many shapes,
Weren't you supposed to meet with Aihara-kun?
But if you run away, nothing will begin.
Let's do it again next year!
Seeing you hesitate just because you have homework seemed like a lie.
That band from before invited me.
We'll go around to different live houses and feel the reactions of the audience up close.
I made a promise with you, right?
Baton pass.
Then I thought that it was really true.
But...
And then I would hurt you each time.
I love you, too.
I said my goodbyes to Hoshino-san.
You're too cheeky for a little brother.
Her daily routine is to see that people obey the school rules at the front gate.
Checking that people follow the rules again today?
He keeps talking about stupid things, so I gave him a stern warning.
Only perverted and weak men would be happy over short skirts.
I don't.
I was practicing this morning.
Geez, just what do they think school is for?
I'm only going to let you go this one time.
Am I the weird one?
Sorry, but I'm busy.
Maybe this is a bit childish.
No, as the public morals officer, this is the natural thing for me to do.
I know how it feels!
"H-How'd you know?"
"No, what are you saying?"
Sorry.
What's he going to practice out here?
I was just curious about it too.
Thanks, you're a life saver.
Yeah, you know, the one where they fight in caves.
There were so many people too!
Yeah, yeah, the number of them was amazing, yet the scenes all fit well.
This is, well...
No, we were just having a small chat.
Ah, well, about that...
I was really happy that you even invited me.
N-No, not really.
That was so frustrating.
It feels like I dreamt something...
There's barley tea in the fridge.
I'm sweaty after all that walking.
Wait a minute!
That's right! That's right!
Mao-neechan!
Take good care of me, please. something better? anyone? structure
What the heck is this movie?!
You sure are understanding, Sanada. structure
Well, sorry about that!
What?!
So sleepy... So sleepy.. or sleepy would be better than I'm sleepy.
3rd year, Class C, huh?
Let's get along well.
I wanted to forget that I saw it!
Ah, I see.
We're in the same class, Aihara-kun!
S-Something like that.
Do you go to cram school?

I wanted to ask everyone for their numbers though.

I think it's about time I go back to my room and sleep...
I won't let you sleep until you talk!

How about joining the Soccer Club?
Even if you don't do anything, new members will join the Soccer Club anyways, right? PLEASE CHECK FOR GRAMMAR

Oh, you're early.
Ah, no.
It looked like he left in a hurry.
I wonder what went wrong?
We'll take a break from the experiment.
Oh, I see.
Unlike you, I don't ha8590v100100e anything I want to do.
It's no use, I just can't get it!
Could it ha8590v100100e been a date?
Well, thank you for the hard work.
It's second year math, so it must be simple for you, right?
Please.
Um, Kouichi, I'm not the same as I was during middle school.
What happened?
Ah!
I just thought of a great idea!added "just"
Mao-neechan!
That might be true, but...grammar
I'm not sure if I'll be of any help though.
Does that mean you don't get it?
All right, next is history, let's do our best!grammar
I see.
Something we like?
That's kind of interesting.
Let's make a good country! World cup!grammar
You're smart,
What are you saying?
Did I say something bad?
About what?
She's always been smart.
That's impossible.
Ah, Greetings. This is Hiiragi Akira.
This is where I can show my skills as the leader.

Its my first time having these feelings.
Midterms are o8590v100100er now,
and bring to light any difficulties the film may meet with.
I wanted the ending to ha8590v100100e a kind of happy feeling.
What was with that strict teacher?
Hey, what are you all doing?
You sure are late.
Yeah, sounds good.
H-Hello!
The store opens up at fi8590v100100e, right?
Yeah. Well, no, I'm not seriously trying to become one or anything.
Nello...
...is what he said.
What kind of character am I supposed to be?
W-Why?
Forget it.
But now that I think about it, you're not fit for a lo8590v100100e story-type role.
Pushing it a bit?
Hey, Futami-san...
Yes.
It's good like this.
No, it's definitely not normal!
Experiment?
U-Um, will you really play the role? 
I knew it was too good to be true.
Yes.
So, I can't play the heroine in a lo8590v100100e story.
When did we decide that?
We're counting on you.
Yeah, but...
Is a kiss the beginning of lo8590v100100e?
and blue sky,
and watch your wavering dreams.
Only you...
be10It looks like its about to fall apart.
Mao-neechan?
Are you all right?
It's all because you were walking around while da8780z100100ed.
That's not it, idiot.
I wonder what Kai-kun's intention was.
About yesterday...
You were ranked first on the midterms. That's ama8780z100100ing.
I know myself the best.
The script isn't e8590v100100en finished yet.
Crap.
You're with Futami-san.
You just smiled, didn't you?
I didn't smile.
H-How is it?
So that's why she chose berry-berry.
If we're going to confirm her bad taste, we should go to a good store.
I understand.
You're right, I had thought it was natural.
This is quite a surprise.
How's the taste of Satonaka's udon, Futami-san?
It's good.
Your grandpa is quite the gourmet.
Well, either way,
Um, it's late for introductions, but...
Take care!
It's finally time for the long-awaited swimming tournament!
which has stopped the flow of time.
be10The first time you walked me home during that starry night.
be10Beyond the door are diamonds.
The swimming tournament at school will be the perfect chance for it!
All right, it's settled!
Ah, no, I didn't mean it like that!
Mao-neechan...
Ah, I guess this is the first time you'8590v100100e both met him.
Sorry, I think I'm going to go home after all.
Take care.
Each of you will check the girls on your team,
Kuryu-san!
Ah, um, this is...
What is it?
Ah, no.
Sakino-sempai is really ama8780z100100ing though.
She can only stand out at times like these.
Hey, hey! Ha8590v100100e a taste of this.
It's as good as the one I ate at Satonaka Udon.
Don't feel down, Naru-chan!
No, these are dotsuki goggles.
Dotsuki?
If you're okay with my parker then-
The scores are becoming closer, too.
Let's go tell the teacher we'll forfeit this match.
Do you want to lose?
I know without ha8590v100100ing to do it.
No, you don't know!
please gather around the start line.
On your marks.
That's right, I completely forgot!
I forgot my parker in the infirmary!
I think he had a well toned body!
I took the wrong ones.
That's right, my contact!
You dropped your contact?!
What should I do? My throbbing heart doesnt know,
I knock on the door to your heart,

It's better if you don't mo8590v100100e around, Mao-neechan.
What was that dream just now?
W-What's up?
Come on, stop standing around and go wake your dad.
Mao-neechan?
All right, we're off!
Why are you mentioning him out of nowhere?
We aren't fighting or anything.
I'm going to sleep.
What's wrong with her?
No...
So she got angry at you.
I wonder if there'll be lightning to strike her down?
You know, relati8590v100100es rarely get together, yeah?
Yeah, I thought I'd get some coffee but I didn't ha8590v100100e the money.
Tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
I guess I can't ask her.
I see, a cold, huh?
we need to contrast it with something that is beyond a8590v100100erage.
No way, you didn't e8590v100100en get her permission.
I got her permission.
Hey, Hiiragi.
A princess will appear, a king will appear...
Huh?
Yes, his fe8590v100100er has gone down a bit.
I was searching for my contact,
You were really out-of-tune!
Welcome to my home!
be10Thousands of dreams transcribed onto a notebook.
be10We made a promise with a kiss on that day.
be10So precious that I couldnt touch it.
You're coming too, Eriko-chan?
Okay.
It looks expensive!
Maybe.
How about we split up?
We'll just look around at random, then.
Don't run!
I think it was during the 20th year of the Meiji period.
Geez, they just don't listen.
You're amazing...
What do you mean, "what?"
Yuumi-chan?
No, it's nothing.
Hey, did you know? First-class chefs made these dishes!
We were able to discover various things in the kitchen!
Hoshino-san, you haven't touched your food.
No, it makes me happy, too.
Eh?!
Let's trade slips.
It's all right.
Three!
Nine!
May I ask you something personal?
I see. That's good, then.
Thank you.
We can't find anyone!
She's a bit better than when we first met her, though.
It's an experiment.
I've never played hide and seek before.
I see.
It's not weird,
What a weird face.
Have you experienced love?
Didn't you have something to do today?
Shijou-san's house was really big, though.
Ah, I'm sorry.
The cooking at Shijou-sempai's place was really good!
and blue sky,
be10Its now time to run.
What's wrong? Did something happen after all?
It's nothing, really.
It was so fun, and I thought it'd be great if it could continue, and...
He might think I'm weird now.
Only about two months left...
Yuumi-chan is.
Don't let these kinds of chances get away!
I forgot something.
You're unusually energetic this morning as well, Mao-neechan.
I hope something good happens between you and Juliet-chan, Iwao-kun. HOT LESBIAN SEX KTHX
Ah! I got it!
Love fortune,

That might be good!

What is it?
It looks good! Needs finetime

be10We made a promise with a kiss on that day.
Yesterday? Are you all right?
Do you need a hand?
Really?
Like what? Well, nothing yet...
Tell me!
So you like her.
Probably.
Anyway, hurry up and get better.
It's all because Sanada-kun did his best.
I only helped a bit.
Eh, ah, no...
Of course.
Thanks.
Let's go.
So you like her.
All right!
You don't seem to be the type of person who would ride a train.
Thanks for treating me.
Is something wrong?
Anyway, what do you want to do after we're done here?
Is there somewhere you want to go to?
Hoshino-san?
Do you want to go now?
Hello, these two, please.
Thanks. Is that your boyfriend?
How nice, if I were only ten years younger.
How pretty...
So he's been looking after me...
It's okay, really!
I don't want to be separated from you!
What's wrong?
When?
I just can't hold it in!
Even if you transfer, we'll always be together.
Summer vacation, huh?
and runs towards you.
Its my first time having these feelings.
which has stopped the flow of time.
be10Always consider that,
It will be sunny throughout the nation this weekend,
I have something to ask you.
but how you spend your time together.
At the end of September.
Damn it!
Why didn't you slide harder?!
You never seem to finish it off properly at the end.
With a half-hearted play like that, you won't make it as a starting member this time.
Yes!
Um, it's not like I came to see you to kill time.
So, you're a substitute...
Injuries are a show of your ability.
I see.
Ah, even though it's a practice match, it's important to me.
Bye.
Who was it?
Yes.
Ah, it's onii-chan!
Come on, onii-chan!
Aihara-kun!
Now? Nothing, really.
About the beach we were talking about last time,
I think it's a nice place, and it fits you.
I already wrote the scene though.

No, you don't need to move the discussion to me.grammar

Don't worry about it.
My grandpa thought you all must be having it tough since it's hot out.
I think I'm doing a bit better thanks to them.
I thought it wasn't my thing.
she fits the image perfectly.
Hello?
Sorry for intruding.
He dislikes shiita-
I've got to go shopping.
Good luck?
Y-Your mom is quite interesting.
Sorry it turned out like this.
I'm sure Mao-neechan will refuse
if it's only me asking her to be the movie's heroine.
I should at least ask her myself.
You don't need to feel so down.
I'm back.
Please!
And it's the script Sanada-kun did his best to write!
Condition?
You're surrounded!
Pass! Pass it!
H-How should I say it...
Yeah.
Don't call me for such stupid things.
Isn't Kai-san's live concert tomorrow, though?
Now's the time?
You being so cheerful.
Was I really pushing myself?
Why do I think of him so much, though?
I am here because of your kiss,
be10Always consider that,
be10So try to smile
Sorry.
N-No, it's nothing.
I'll be fine alone.
Mao-neechan?
Y-Yeah, it was fun.
I had a lot of fun at the beach, too.
It's been a while since I've been to a live show,
Yours is strawberry, isn't it?
N-No, it's not that.
Sorry about that, Iwao-kun!
But...
The number you are trying to reach is out of range,
Sorry for the wait!
Why have you been worrying about your phone the entire time?
Ah, no, it's because someone might call me.
Experiments?
Sorry, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
H-Hey!
Where are you going?
I'm conducting experiments with him to see why.
Why do people fall in love?
Why Aihara-kun?
You're right.
I had a lot of fun at the beach, too.
Should we go eat somewhere?
You should go home quickly.
Is something wrong?
Hey, Kai-kun...
my kiss will reach...
be10We might be separated someday

Eh? Again?
It's been a while, so how about we do that? PUSH HER DOWN

Maybe I like you, too. Maybe we looooooooove youHAVE TEH SECKS ALREADY
Did you finish your homework?
Actually, me too.
Thank you!
Thinking about something?
I see.
Did something happen, after all?
Yes!
I thought it'd be good to transfer into the third year at a Japanese high school,
Can you live by yourself?
It's kind of nostalgic.
It's me.
I guess I'm really getting into the role now.
Ah, you're like a real actress!
Thank you!
Well, yeah.
I'll have you be responsible for it.
Go get some water, onii-chan.
Which one are you going to pick, Naru-chan?
I am here because of your kiss,
But...
I'm sorry, Kai-kun.
Mao-neechan hasn't come back yet?
She said she had something to do, so she left first.
No way, why do I have to go there with my sister at this age?
I thought it'd be better if you two had a talk.
The swings, huh?
Hey, Futami-san.
Me?
That's because they've found someone else they like.
Mao-neechan has a cold?!
It's all because you worked her hard.
No.
I've really fallen in love with you!
What are you doing, spacing out like that?
I was thinking about something.
We'll start where you left off.
I've prepared some tea over there.
Snacks! Snacks! Snacks! Udon!
I'm glad you have an appetite now.
I decided that I'd do my best in soccer and forget all of it.
Futami-san told me bluntly that the experiments are over.
Sorry.
Ah...
Came back all soaked.
Just leave me alone.
I can't leave you alone!
be10so that everyone can cross them
The one I like is you, Kouichi!
Hey...
Are you over your cold now?
Y-Yeah, sorry for making you worry.
Well, I'll be going ahead.
Damn, I let one by me.
Morning.
Um, students...
Let's go home, Hoshino-san.
It's first come, first serve for the class assignment.
Hurry!
Mizusawa-sempai?
I see, maybe he went ahead.
You're working hard.
It's because there's a match soon.
But, I just can't do it.
That's my conclusion.
Look Sanada.
The best spot got taken because you were slow! pwnd
I'm having fun. WATASHI WA KIRA DESS

I love you, too.

I'd just make you suffer even more if I was moping about it.
You saw how lame I was.
It's unusual to see you looking at this kind of stuff.
Hoshino.
I guess unusual things can happen, too.
I didn't think Hoshino-san would be absent-minded during class.
Could you not understand what I said?
I'm stupid, so say it to me clearly so that I can understand it!
Let's move forward together!
I'll give you credit this time for approaching her with everyone around.
What are you trying to say?
I'm worried, too.
You're cool and beautiful, but you're spontaneous sometimes.
If they do change...
I'm not crying.
Why am I crying?

But, I...
Look.
R-Really?
Why did I let them meet?
No, it's nothing.

Thanks, make sure that you come and cheer for me!
Ability-wise, East Kibina is a lot better than we are.
She's been looking down these past few days, though.
What are you doing, moping around at noon?
Ah, Kouichi, I'm fine.
Hoshino-san she had to get ready to move, too,
All right, I'll have you help me out, then!
Geez, why are you acting so sad?
I made a mistake since I used it for half a year.

O-Okay.

"Thanks," huh?
What are you saying?
I'm sorry if that offended you.
Come on, let's go, it's our last school festival.
Let's just party today!
I won't forgive you if you become half-hearted again.
I said that I'd come see you even if you transfer.
I can't see you anymore.

Ah!
Oh, what's up?

I brought some customers!
Can they stay while we're preparing?
Yeah, it's good.

But, could this be...
We don't know who it is yet.

She currently has no boyfriend.
Good morning, Kuryuu-san.
How could you not have experienced romance?
It must be weird, right?
You were born a girl,
so it'll be a waste if you don't experience some romance.
Is romance that important?
We won't bring them again!
It's the two lovers' farewell ceremony.
That's why they should improve upon their own self-management. TLC
I'm not done talking to you yet.
Kuryuu-san.
You don't need to keep watch at the gate every morning, either.
Oh? Don't tell me, you've found someone you like?
It's so nice to be young.
It happened to me too!
And then, I would catch a cold from leaving the window open the whole time.
And when we go to school together the next day, we'd both sneeze.
If, for argument's sake, that I would happen to go out with a boy,
Really?
It is red.

About as good? You mean as good as the berry-berry ramen?
A friend?
See you all tomorrow.
Bye, Nana-chan!
Mao-neechan...
What's that piece of cloth?
This is Kai-kun from my class.
Y-You too, Mao-neechan.
May I come in, Mao-neechan?
Go on.
No.
I left my swimsuit here.
Ah, um, this is...
I guess I'll try some then. Let's see...
Really?!
Don't you know the term "sports science?"
Good luck!
That's right, you shouldn't push yourself!
I'll do my best, including your share.
False start, you're disqualified.
She really won...
I was surprised too!
I was looking around.
I took the wrong ones.
Sanada Kouichi?
I'm scared.
and forms a clique.
H-Hey...
If you're heading to Kitahoro High School, it's that way.
we're going to have a test of courage on the day before the closing ceremony.
I bet we'll see real ghosts if she does.
And summer break means...
Um...
That was close, Kazehaya.
I'm so happy.
How's class?
Yeah,
You should apologize.
I haven't really had a chance to talk to you yet.
That's awesome, Sadako.
Hey...
No.
good job, you.
That's good.
I It's thanks to you.
I never did anything.
You're actually pretty cheerful.
He just stopped talking all of a sudden.
It's summer break!
I can't use all that!
You were with Sadako yesterday, weren't you?
That's impolite.
What?
Don't worry,
his coolness, his honesty, his outgoingness.
Morning.
What the hell?
It smells moldy. Seriously.
Was that a Buddha statue?
Kazehaya-kun is still my idol.
You're worrying too much about her, Kazehaya.
Sadako this, Sadako that.
So you're not going to avoid me during the sessions?
I don't think I'll ever stop feeling this way.
No, I really don't get it.
I never knew happiness could bring tears.
Hey, didn't Sadako get rejected?
Yeah, go for it.
It'll be fine.
Of course.
I thought I was used to having this sort of thing rejected.
We're in separate classes, right?
Go for it.
Um...
Don't make a racket.
Didn't Ueda's grades drop? He was beside Sadako.
Trade, please?
I'm at the back.
Sadako's number 3!
You can have this back.
Yoshida, your draw
You don't need to be here.
Want some?
Yeah...
You baked those?
so glad...
H-How embarrassing.
I still respect him and admire him.
My dreams are becoming a reality.
Sawako-chan, then
I can't cheer for you honestly, so I can't help you.
Shut up.
Why don't you back off?
This is the part where you're supposed to know your place and back off.
You want to go out with Kazehaya?
You have to work hard when you're cute and popular like I am.
Really?
It looks good.
That way!
Kick!
Is she teleporting?
She kicked it.
Godspeed! Godspeed! Godspeed!
She's so nice.
I think I went too far yesterday.
Really? Is that okay?
Oh yeah, she always called me Sawako-chan.
What?
Of course.
Holy shit!
Flash of light!
She's awesome now!
But Sadako's not her name, is it?
Sakako.
No!
It's something like Tawashi...
Sa
Shouta, you're with me, right?
It's like they're listening to us talk.
Kazehaya-kun.
You
Don't talk as if you know what you're talking about.
He'd always be in your sight.
Everything was so new to me.
Or if there's anything more.
Let's go.
Everyone around me is so nice.
Admiration, respect, romance...
What's next?
Are you interested in Kuronuma?
Kuronuma.
Oh yeah, like black.
What year, what class?
Um, never mind, I'll find it myself.
Okay.
Nothing, really.
Tonight it'll be a pack.
There were rumors about you.
You'd have to be an idiot to buy it.
I bet Sawako was in her way.
Oh well, I'll nap outside.
I just miscalculated a little.
And really red.
And there's something I want to find out.
See you.
And we have some work to do too.
Yano-chin looks evil.
You got it. Wow.
Wow, why does this letter say exactly what I had in mind?
You want some help?
What's wrong?
You're right.
During softball.
She was staring at Sanada.
Next episode: Love
See? Look.
Probably.
Wait, why Kurumi?
Kurumi should be thankful of me.
Oh, do you think...
Sort of lame, her getting jealous of me.
Come on, it's obvious she's liked Kazehaya the whole time.
It's fine.
Selfish or self-centered, do anything for me or don't,
No, I mean, as boyfriend and girlfriend.
Ryu, Sadako was looking for you.
What? Why are you stopping me?
What are you doing here?
Settle for some brat from your own class or something.
Thanks, Tomo, Ekkou.
Oh, maybe they're at volleyball practice.
Shadowboxing?
is such a happy thing.
There's someone I like.
and here's the proof.
B-But this is your writing!
Liars go to hell, you know that?
School gang leader...?
an8Sadako: Legend of the Secret School Gang Leader
I seriously hate all of them.
I started all of it.
You were in the way.
Why is it wrong for me to use people?
Why should I have to?
Oh, that's, whatever.
Kurumi's not really the enthusiastic type.
I'm Sadako.
Go, Chizu.
You're the only person I've ever told.
Kazehaya.
What are you looking at?
Did you hear that?
Pin? Of all people?
That's a little weird.
So you were still here.
That's what I came here to tell you earlier.
I wanted to tell you.T: in your face, you back-stabbing bitch
That was the first time I told anyone.
more...
in love with him.
I know he doesn't like me.
I can talk to you about him.T: to rub it in more, she means to say
It's not dirty.
He's popular with both the guys and girls.
and cool...
It was my chance.
I still wouldn't like it.
What a waste.
Kurumi lent Miyagawa her notes and stuff.
She got in our way already, right?
You want to skip?
Really?
I see.
What's wrong?
Anyone.
No!
Sorry, Kurumizawa.
What? Kazehaya?
I knew it.
What?
But if she had liked someone else, I might not have known.
I'm glad I said it.
Morning.
Kurumi-chan?
What, did you cry yourself out of it?
Because they're dumbasses.
You sure are having fun.
I'm going to win and party like hell.
We'll wait over there.
I'm never going to congratulate you.
I hate any woman that Kazehaya likes.
Rivals!
Why?!
Arai-sensei lost his spirit,
My first rival.ok she's asperger's
I wonder when I started feeling like this.
Kazehaya, what are you singing next?
Kuronuma?
Yes?
Next episode: Night Talk
If you're heading to Kitahoro High School, it's that way.
That's why they were down.
That has to be the best thing to do.
That's frustrating.
Don't talk to me.
I'd want to stay together.
After the love story though, what happens next?
Y-Yoshida.
We're friends now, right?
Like?
You're always with Kazehaya, and you don't even have to try.
I hate you.
Shoot, I brought some too.
I like homemade cake more.
This is my dad.
They're pretty good, right?
Thanks.
It's a pain in the ass, so I figured, whatever.
He sure is an adult.
Why does she want me to cleanse?
But I got home and forgot all about her warnings.
He wants me to bring Kuronuma.
She bought enough for us too.
Thanks, you didn't have to.
Later.
A cold.
do you think I'm okay?
He opens the door, but there's no one there.
Oh yeah, aren't you going to play with Maru?
He really does.
Go home, pesky brats.
Walk her home, Kazehaya.
It's fine, I'll be careful not to scare anyone.
That's not it.
Pedro!
The days are getting shorter.
Y-You scared me!
That bastard!
See, I can't stand parting with him.
You know, it's cold today.
What is it?
Oh yeah, I used to think,
Time flies.
Yeah.
Why don't you answer right away?
Now I think guys are.
Hell no.
Chizu-chan and Sanada-kun sort of have the same air about them.
I'm all about Chizuru.
Shoot, I died!
Yeah, Dad's taking a bath.
I want to see him as soon as possible.
See you.
Do you hear our destiny stepping towards us?
I thought maybe for a change.
...I think.
So I'm going to become an awesome woman.
Of course he knows.
You were still there?
I can't, not next week.
You must have guts to wear that.
I don't have money.
That's embarrassing.
Chizu-chan looks so happy.
Sorry, Yano-chin.
Hey...
Huh?
Next episode: Dream
You don't have to do anything.
Oh yeah, I'll call you.
What's up with him?
Huh? No.
Friendship!
All-in huh? Who would have thought.
I'm the boss tonight!
I'm coming in.
No way.
No, but...
Tohru!
Hide Yano!
I'm kidding.
Hey Ryu, why haven't you told me?
What's up? Come in.
I've loved her like a little sister since she was young.
Hey you, outsiders, let's get out of here.
See you.
I wonder what she's thinking right now.
Later.
I think you were.
Oh man, I win again.
There's more fish in the sea.
I'm wearing a miniskirt!
Nice sweater, right?
Of all times, this time I had nothing to say.
But...
No, thank you. It's been fun.
Okay, I will.
You're late.
Are you trying to be nice to me?
Why?
Is it something about Yoshida?
And she's supposed to be easy to read.
Let's hear her out if she talks to us.
Nah, I'll be back right away.
I didn't really go to see Tohru yesterday.
What?
So I went to give you the present after he'd already have left.
I hate Ryu.
I'm glad it came to this.
When else are you going to vent?
Yeah he is.
Let it all out.
I went to his house, and he goes, forget about him.
All right, let's go eat cake.
Smile, if you're happy.
Could you pick one?
Grand slam!
I've known Ryu forever.
He was a good person in middle school too.
Because of that there's a lot of girls from our middle school here.
Now everyone wants to do it.
You said you'd do it, didn't you?
I'll help.
Tha
everyone's going to know everything about your embarrassing past.
I better go.
Hey,
Thought so.
Hirano-san and Endou-san helped me out.
I thought that, maybe, I could live up to your expectations with this.
Everything up until now will be on the midterm.
What are you doing, Kazehaya?
I have to focus.
Wait, Maru.
Studying and stuff.
Wait, fantasizing?
Speaking of which, have you told anyone about Maru?
I see.
I can't be the only one who's seen him smile,
I hope tomorrow will be a good day too.
This one and this one.
Could you help us too?
You make it so easy.
K-Kazehaya-kun.
Today
I was happy, of course.
...to myself.
Yeah, the ex-delinquent who used to be in a detention center.
No way, that's insane.
Who...
feelings miscommunicated.
No?
That's good.
You want to have ramen before we go home?
Really?
We said a lot about Ryu,
I must have wanted to talk to Tohru.
Just kidding.
What?
Why?
You want to go for tea or something?
How about work?
Cut the boring talk, already.
I'm really happy.
24 must seem old at your age.
I figured I'd walk with you today.
Welcome.
You used to eat this all the time.
It was you.
Huge star.
The sky's so dark in the country.
It must be complicated.
Tohru was always smiling.
I didn't think you'd get married.
Or even that I'm in high school now.
Chi.
How old is this?
I think so too.
Ow.
She looks better, now that she had a chance to meet Tohru.
Good, exams are over too.
Right?
Like I said, everyone.
Who knows, I might not either.
I want to.
I made them as Christmas gifts.
Maybe I can just make one.
I could buy that myself.
Dad's totally revved up.
Cake, huh?
Look at her now, all big and healthy.
Stop it Dad, you're crying.
So it's a bit early, but...
And coasters for you.
I want to.
Have fun.
Next year.
Thanks, Sawako. Merry Christmas.
I was wondering how you're doing.
You're not lonely, are you?
Sounds fun over there.
I might not make it.
But I still want to go.
Who's in?
You're here.
Sent.
The day of the closing ceremony.
No, I think so too.
Sawako didn't know where the second half of the party was.
Not done yet.
M-Morning.
They responded!
If you don't mind, could you give it to your dad or mom or grandpa
M-Morning.
It wasn't the same to me.
It's the closing ceremony today.
He's a gold-digger?
Arai-sensei...
Bow.
but so much of what I thought about and experienced was new to me.
Sure.
We just went yesterday.
You're going to read the whole thing?
Make it long so that you don't get spammed.
You idiot, of course we can.
You scared me, why would you bring that up now?
I can see everyone on New Year's.
Do you have Kazehaya's phone number?
Just if you want to see him.
I'll get to see him.
You're here early.
Thanks.
I'll go get my coat.
I'm not going to ruin their efforts.
Is he upset?
Happy birthday, Sawako.
I-I know; I didn't even s-see them.
Where are you?
You're too loud.
Sorry.
Ryu says he's busy too.
Aren't you cold?
Shit, they're headed straight for Joe.
He loves Kazehaya; he's totally going to spot him.
Shit, hurry.
So warm.
Good, no one left to get in our way.
I hate sweet sake.
Yes please.
Thanks.
Oh no, I'm actually happy.
Oh yeah, one more thing.
I put a hand warmer in the pocket.
It's mine now.
No, it doesn't matter.
Can I send it to you?
I-It's my first time texting; i-it might take me a while.
You were with me at the moment I turned sixteen.
Fifteen minutes until the new year.
Nothing special,
That's fine. It's just me asking. Tell me.
in the Sumire and Suzuran groups.
Is that gloomy?
Elementary's over already?
If only I could be like Kazehaya-kun...
Next episode: New Year
This year was too different for me.
I'll try to have a different vibe next year.
I didn't think you'd remember when we first met.
but more than that...
Think about why you want to be cute.
I used to want to be more like Kazehaya-kun.
Go already.
No, I'll get fat.
Try saying Chi.
Besides, I don't think you need to worry about them.
It's already...
Oh well.
Happy new year.
All the things I thought about,
I heard Bad is actually pretty good.
Kuronuma,
have this one.
Now that I think of it, I don't know why I wasn't sure I liked him.
Finally found you.
But man, they really look like a normal couple when they're like that.
If only Tohru were here.
Don't people tell you you're cute?
Past this hill...
Just a little bit.
You look like a pervert.
I had fun. Really.
Relationships  Offer your love. Happiness awaits.
Classmate,
He's more distant than a friend, and I want him to be more than a friend.
and I will find only one
I wish I could live like this forever, but...
I want to be like those paper airplanes filling the sky
If you stare into her eyes for more than three seconds...
She has to be real!
You have to give it to her parents for giving her such an appropriate name.
That's what I heard! Hirano-san... Endou-san...
It's Kazehaya-kun!
Everyone gathers around Kazehaya-kun,
Since that day, I've aspired to be like Kazehaya-kun.
I hope that someday, I'll be able to act like him.
He noticed?
Shino-chan!
No way!
He's... amazing...
Amazing... this is the first time someone from school has called me by my name...
You'd better come to that event, okay?
H-H-How long have you been standing there?
It's just that it makes me happy if I could be of some use...
What?
I can't sense ghosts or anything.
I'm a sucker for brave girls like her...
Even if it was just a little bit, I feel like I was able to change.
Looks like almost everyone is here.
It's so dark...
I think they liked it!
I'm actually being useful to everyone!
But... what about the event?
If you guys knew about this, you should've told me.
No, I wouldn't have been able to express my feelings if it weren't for you.
Don't make me say it, geez...
He suddenly stopped talking, so I don't really know what to do...
It's over!
P-Please excuse me.
He may never smile and say, "Good morning," to me again.
They said you were the shadow MVP.
The misunderstanding was cleared up, right?
Back then...
Thanks!
That feeling I felt back then...
Is it all right if I expect...
Apparently, she was rejected right before summer break!
She's praying.
I find it hard to interact with people, and I can't quite get the hang of it,
Even after all the trouble I caused him, he's willing to treat me like everyone else?
I didn't reject her.
You won't avoid me even if we see each other there?
That's not what it was about...
What are you talking about? I don't get it at all.
I'm the one who didn't get it...
No, I don't get it at all!
It's her way of saying thanks!
Oh, I was thinking of giving this to the dog...
Do you like dogs?
Th-The one by the river?
Over here!
Mind if I take him?
Good...
Good friends?
You'll be fine.
U-Umm, if it's not too much trouble...
Go for it!
Well, we'll be changing seating assignments during our homeroom session, so you can do it on your own.
Nakanishi broke his leg, remember?
Wow, so Kazehaya-kun is somewhere over there... Please! This is the only thing I'll ever ask of you!
Wow, that sucks!
Umm...
No, it's fine!
Th-That hurts!
Whoever that picked 19, will you trade with me?
Yes.
I'm hungry...
I'm hun-
...to be in this seat.
Good, you're not crying.
Haven't we been seeing them together a lot recently?
Did Sadako really get rejected?
A new seat.
If we didn't know that, we'd think you were angry!
O-On second thought, you don't have to smile.
You just give off a gloomy look.
You, too, Ryu.
M-Morning...
I wonder what Pin-sensei was trying to do?
I wonder why...
Ryu and I are childhood friends, and we went to the same middle school as Kazehaya.
Yeah! Yeah!
Everyone's Kazehaya.
Like her, for example?
Yeah, like her.
We can get it done a lot faster if we both work on it.
Wait, if Kazehaya's doing it, I don't mind helping out either...
Stop by the faculty room later!
First Year, Class D - Attendance Log Kitahoro High School
Kazehaya-kun...
I snuck out while Pin went to the bathroom.
I...
Thank goodness.
But you were telling Yoshida-san that you were glad to be able to talk to her, right?
You were always greeting us, so...
Oh yeah, what did people used to call you before they started using 'Sadako'?
You're always the one who gives me the strength to act.
But... if that was really true...
So I heard you were able to open up to Hirano-chan and Endou-chan.
And they helped you out, right?
Don't mention it.
"Is this the part they don't understand? How can I explain it so it's easy to understand?"
This and that.
If you don't mind...
That made me really happy of course, but...
Huh? Is he talking to somebody?
Let's go.
What?! Seriously?! Seeing her smile like that really makes me think she's just a normal girl.
And that other one, Yano. I hear she really likes guys.
Oh, really?
That's not the answer I'm looking for!
I'm asking who started the rumor!
Sa...
How's school been lately?
Look what you've done, Dear! What is wrong with you?!
I've done far worse than that, you know. She made teachers cry and punched all the guys in her class!
I'll see for myself.
That's just insane!
I'm out of here!
I'm talking about that Kuronuma girl, of course.
Why do you ask?
Seriously, I have to get going.
What's with his taste?
I don't even know. PLACEHOLDER
His forehead...
I really hope so.
Obviously we don't believe any of it, but...
I guess all three of us tend to stand out in a bad way.
But it's great...
Hang on, I want to hear the rest.
I really, really like them.
Sorry to trouble you, Sadako.
I still think... they look sad.
And that makes me sad, too.
"Back her up"?
C-Cut it out! Cut it out!
I don't want to think about it either!
I need to let them know that Yano-san and Yoshida-san aren't backing me up or anything.
I could never bring myself to hate you.
Kuronuma...
You've never avoided me no matter what I did, and yet...
I was just thinking about the upcoming tests.
Oh, so they start tomorrow, huh...
Yeah.
Even if I find the people who are spreading the rumors and correct the misunderstanding,
I was so happy...
...how it feels to be treated kindly, and the feeling of wanting to return the kindness...
Kuronuma!
Rumors?
If I want to speak to you, then I will.
I've... always been longing for people like this...
And yet...
So the reason things are kind of rough between the three of you was because of rumors, too, huh?
Never.
Don't forget, you already have someone you can talk to, too.
I'm going to try talking to them tomorrow.
Go for it!
I will!
You know, it was your fault to begin with!
Isn't this the book Sadako was reading?
Were you jogging or something?
Thought so.
When I asked who started the rumors, they said it all came from Sadako...
Well, I guess she doesn't like you then.
Who in their right mind would do that?
Isn't that kind of sad?
Stop crying. You're embarrassing me.
Oh my gosh! Quit scaring me!
Man, I'm so screwed for today's test!
So... umm....
Don't you think she's glaring at us?
I don't know what he meant, but I'm happy.
I'll let you know what they're like.
And my eyes aren't that thin.
Sadako.
You wanna ask just to be sure?
So that ramen...
Can I copy that?
Triple pure white!
Pin was talking to me about little old men.
She's normal, I think?
I hope they do.
They're saying you beat an elderly man to a pulp.
I think people are even more afraid of me lately.
Everyone around me is so kind.
Friendship is like what's between Yano-san and Yoshida-san, right?
So I really hope I'll be able to call them friends someday.
Give it to Ryu.
Everyone's pissing me off!
I want to talk about something important.
I got it.
Seriously?
Black rumors?
Kazehaya's going to become seriously worthless too, if he keeps getting followed around by Sadako.
do you think Sadako spread those rumors?
Either way, she doesn't like us.
Morning.
Did I do something?
Were you crying earlier?
Tell me.
But I don't want to avoid him.
Is it right to avoid him? Is it wrong?
I don't know.
Sadako!
Shut up already.
Morning.
Morning.
Apparently, there's a fight inside the girl's bathroom.
Hang in there...
We want to talk it out with you.
The same goes for you, right?
That's what we think, so everything's fine.
Now run along.
Yano-san! Yoshida-san!
There's no way she'd do something like that.
Y-You totally are!
Even though I really wanted to get along with everyone,
I... didn't know how to cheer you two up when you were feeling down...
Sadako... that's what you were hurt over?
Friends?
The cast changed halfway through the show, and everything ended happily ever after!
Well, I guess I don't have to cheer her up anymore.
Where's the fight at?!
Zashiki Warashi. Sign: Zashiki Warashi
I've met people who have become really important to me. Did you know? Friends go out to eat ramen together.
Please take good care of Sadako!
F-Fine, I'll listen.
Okay!
He said that he hates it when people spread trashy rumors.
I wonder if she's okay?
Those girls are so stupid.
It should be obvious that Kazehaya wouldn't like girls who cause such a commotion.
I totally forgot it was closed!
I don't like that "light" stuff when it comes to ramen.
A bit pushy, are we?
You brought over some friends tonight?
Here you go.
I've always wanted you to try out the ramen here!
Of course.
Th-Then I'll order that.
I had that last time!
They're out of water.
We're busy right now. I-I feel as though I just saw Sanada-kun here...
Hang on! Who's the older brother, then?
I-I think you're missing the point, too...
Laughter.
Right?
...I do want him to come.
I'll be right there on my bike!
H-He said he's coming!
For our last two years, yeah.
He's looked the same for as long as I can remember.
Wow!
I wonder what he was like in middle school?
I'm really excited!
Yeah!
I'll be able to have fun with everyone...
This girl...
Do you think her "love" for him is the same as her "love" for us?
I'm neither perverted nor emo!
Come on! Don't laugh at me, Kuronuma!
Just kidding. N-No, I wasn't making fun of you or anything!
Sadako.
You really feel like a girl!
This guy's dad used to coach my little league baseball team, so I've known them since they were brats!
You didn't know that, right, Sawako?
Well, yeah! My place is really old!
Right.
She's...
...an exorcist?!
Well, it's about time for us to leave.
Thanks for letting us stay!
W-Why are you headed this way, too?!
I guess you could say that.
K-Knew what?
You changed my life!
Hmm... I have no idea.
Kurumi!
...weird things have been happening to me.
That's the first time anyone's ever said that of me!
I'll smile! Definitely!
Good one!
Yeah. Both the joke and the smiling myth.
I-I'm so happy!
So, as friendships progress, you start calling each other by first names!
You memorized them, right?
Don't you think that's kind of rudely familiar?
You're really not used to these things, are you?
Guinea pig?
I mean...
See? It'll be difficult to try it on guys, so you should start with girls first.
Th-That made me so nervous...
Right. I'll try my best.
Oh, so Yano just made her call me that.
...he's a guy.
He didn't even have to run for the position!
If you suck, don't come on the day of the festival!
I'll mark you down as excused!
I'll show them what I'm made of!
We'll defeat them all!
Nope, never.
Hey, do you guys want to take some time from lunch to practice, then?
He was pretty much forced into being the rep.
Speaking of that, I heard Kazehaya's the committee representative for Class D.
Then do it!
We'll just nominate you! How's that?
It's all yours, Sadako!
Yeah, I kinda saw this coming.
I'm sorry...
You should smile instead of looking pale, Sadako.
Chizu-chan!
I can't let them waste their precious time on me!
It's creepy. I need to get a soccer ball...
Over here!
You guys better finish up soon! You'll be late for fifth period!
Let's head back.
Yeah! I need to buy a red t-shirt so I can stand out at the sports festival.
I know how nice they are. If I tell them I'm planning on practicing, they'll insist on helping me.
Sports festival rep, huh...
What? You want to borrow a soccer ball?
I'll bring it back! I promise.
Ah, thanks.
Sure, I'll try to remember to bring it.
Some band did a cover of the fourth song on the album before the one I lent you, and it's really good...
I don't know why...
When did she get to the ball?
Why don't we try that again?
Nice job!
Nice shot!
It was so hot today!
I'll get changed as soon as I dry up, so head back to the classroom without me.
Oh, hey.
Oh, I see.
Did something happen, Sadako?
Wow! What did they say?
I knew there was something different about him. He's not wearing his vest.
Not too bad.
Sadako's really improved, too.
Good for you!
It may have something to do with the festival committee.
Well, I guess we really don't have to change if it's going to be that much work.
Kuroyama Takako.
But I must say, that's not too bad coming from you.
Oh.
Come on, tell Ryu what her full name is.
Sounds good.
What? What?! Why?
I wasn't expecting you to. It was a joke.
Don't you think she's cute?
Is that something to say when your girlfriend's right here?
Wow...
A perm?!
Brown...
Want to get it permed a bit, then?
Let's both try our best to win!
We're really... friends...
Wait, why weren't you with them?
There's no way I could do that!
...wa...
I-It's nothing...
...I'm thinking about Kazehaya-kun too much?
The tension is leaving my body!
Oh, right. Did you need something?
...friends now, right?
Kick!
Bye-bye!
We're friends now!
Because you're simple.
Friends, huh...
Bye-bye...
We're...
Sawako-chan!
Umm... well...
That's the first time you called me that!
I wish I could be more like her...
My role model... if offering to give me advice?
Bring it on! I dare you to hit the ball this way!
Oh... but you two are really, really different kinds of people.
rather than someone as cheerful as Kazehaya.
I think I get it.
Say, Kurumi-chan?
Well, it was all fine up until then, but...
Chizu-chan, could you take care of her, too?
What's with all this lately?
We just don't really get along!
Could you get me some tea while you're at it?
That's the first time since we met up at Ryu's place.
Wow!
I see!
Yeah.
I feel relieved for some reason.
Wavering emotions.
Kazehaya-kun?
Thanks, Sawako-chan!
Well then, see you tomorrow!
On second thought, I don't think I'll be able to help.
I'm... really sorry I can't be of any use.
I wish there was something else I could do for her.
Do you want to go out with Kazehaya or something?!
She's so right....
The day of the sports festival!
You look like a champ!
Wow, I already feel like we can win this!
I... I feel like I'm a part of the class!
Wait a second, did Sadako disappear off somewhere?
Nice shot!
Ou- Get fired up!
Fired up, I said! Ouch.
Intense grinding before the actual match, huh?
You'd better not lose.
She's such a nice girl!
What an angel!
Don't you dare... call me that anymore.
I'm leaving.
Th-Then what should I call you?
It's an old lady's name that was given to me by my grandmother!
But it's not!
Of...
Huh? Why are you whispering?
Speaking of Sadako, though...
"Numa"...
No, dude... It's Kuronuma.
Why don't you go talk to some of them?
Nice cover, Ryu!
Oh, I have to thank him! I was just at a loss for words!
Huh?
Look out!
Sanada doesn't avoid you or anything, does he?
N-No...
The game just started, Kurumi-chan!
I am, but...
Even on windy days?!
I've had my eyes on him for a while, you know?
What about the game?
Huh?
Great job, everyone.
Endou-san...
It's Tomo, remember?
I'm really touched...
I wonder who's playing next.
Ryu.
I know, but...
There he is.
He needs to carry them to the equipment room.
What was with that extra smile...
Oh, if it isn't Kurumi-chan.
You're Yano Ayane-chan, right?
You think too much of me.
Only someone who likes Kazehaya would start a rumor like that.
And it's hard for the person to do anything about it if Chizu and I are with her.
Putting my rumors aside...
I-If I may ask... Why?
Fine with me.
Do you mind hearing me out when I finally understand?
A lot?
Have you met up with Sanada yet?
That was amazing, wasn't it?
Romantic feelings?
I...
Huh? Earlier?
I can't even compare her to anyone else.
...I truly hoped...
Hold your horses.
I'm getting there.
"Like"?
Really?
This feeling that wells up when I look at him sitting in front of me...
I'm not like the person you think I am at all.
I'm really selfish, and I just have to have things my way.
It's okay.
Like boyfriend and girlfriend.
I guess... she hasn't thought about being in a relationship herself.
So, to put it simply, she didn't want him to find a girl.
What?
Her plan was to make everyone agree to that stupid pact from the start.
Sadako was looking for you earlier.
This clearly isn't Sadako's handwriting!
I don't really get it, but let's look for Kurumi!
Evidence?
Precisely.
So I'm waiting for him.
Well, how should I put this...
She visits Kazehaya from time to time, so I know what she looks like.
I was surprised how exaggerated the rumors were.
Just watch!
What? Is this getting personal?
Huh? I don't see Yano-san and Yoshida-san...
Hey... there's someone I like.
But... my heart is content.
The person I like... is Kazehaya.
What?
And here's the evidence!
Ayane-chan! Chizu-chan!
She's the one who put you through all that hardship.
Huh?
And the suspicions of me being your secret leader?
You're evil, Sawako!
This is so confusing!
It's not my fault! I wasn't the only one spreading those rumors!
Since there's no way you'd do something like-
I'm the one who spread them.
You...
Yes.
See? This is what she's really like!
I don't even care if you apologize or not!
I feel a lot better now.
Now you just sound lame again.
In other words...
Okay. I really will, then.
Well, I didn't really want to at all.
What do you mean by that, anyway?
I should be the one apologizing!
Oh, okay.
I was able to make friends.
I wonder how things were between Kurumi-chan and me...
No, you're Sawako!
You go, Chizu!
Even if those were lies,
...but... she was willing to tell me her feelings, which she holds so dear.
Huh? The women's soccer match is over already?
It sure is tough being so popular with the ladies...
What, did you come here just to laugh at me?
Hurry up and say it, then.
I didn't know it makes your heart beat so fast when you tell a friend something like this.
She's right. She suits him far better than I do.
Besides...
Seeing you cry made me want to, too...
Really?! You two aren't going out?!
Certainly not!
He's popular with both guys and girls...
Then what exactly will be between us, Kurumi-chan?
No bonds, just nobodies to each other?
Bye!
Want to stop by somewhere to eat?
I'm so glad I'm friends with Kurumi now!
Yeah!
Hey, we should get in her way if she starts liking somebody.
We shouldn't.
Yeah. I just dropped by to pick up something.
Ah, I knew I left it here.
...is willing to see me only as myself.
Pretending that she's a hypocrite...
Even if you want to lend her a hand, she always tries hard and does things by herself.
I... don't want him to have the wrong idea.
So many things have gone wrong with my plan.
I don't remember you being like this, Kurumizawa...
I'm surprised she can get that aggressive for a guy.
I kind of respect her for that. I wouldn't be able to do it.
You should treasure your boyfriend more, Yano-chin. It also made me happy when I told you, Kurumi-chan.
Morning!
Hey, you. What's with those sunglasses?
Note: rival - def. A worthy opponent. Note: rival - def. A worthy opponent. Note: rival - def. A worthy opponent.
She said something about her face feeling too hot, and went out to cool off.
I-It's nothing.
Everyone's sitting in attendance order.
Oh yeah, you're in Sadako's seat.
Normally she greets everyone even if it creeps them out.
I don't know.
But she's not being herself.
I may be able to stop the rumors,
but I guess that won't happen anymore.
I don't know how to go back. I don't know.
How did I bear being alone?
The first day of summer,
Reputation?
If I didn't want to, I wouldn't be talking to you now.
Feeling better?
Never again.
I want to tell them.
Go for it.
Go for it, Kuronuma.
I'm going for it. Trust me.
He's the last person I want to hear that from.
This is the book Sadako was reading.
I figured.
Later.
She made this for me, after all.
Sadako hasn't even smiled since things turned awkward.
She'd gotten used to being avoided.
I can't know how someone else is feeling unless I ask.
That's a lie.
Yano-san and Yoshida-san are nice people.
...like that.
You have to give it to her parents for giving her such an appropriate name.
Feel free to use this stall. It's open now.
Do it! Do it!
Go for it!
I just said it!
Heck no! Wow, so Kazehaya-kun is somewhere over there...
No.
But it's great...
You were able to make friends.
Hurting such kind people...
Despite her appearance,
Please...
No...
He's so handsome and cool!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't care whether you leave me alone or not.
Huh?
Now run along.
Kurumi!
Sorry, what were you saying?
Bye...
The thing is... there's someone I like.
On second thought, I don't think I'll be able to help.
That's why I won't be able to help you.
Or maybe because he was friendly to you?!
M-Maybe?
But don't you think Sawako-chan's gotten braver? She refused to help!
Sawako.
I actually came looking for you earlier to tell you this.
"Friends"?
Burnable trash.
You're having friends over today, right?
They're here! What do I do?!
Seriously?
I... I should have made something salty instead!
This is my mother.
You're so...
I-I must have been heavy on his shoulders...
Love?!
I see.
For you two to start dating, of course!
She could totally make it happen...
...how do I put it... I'm already really satisfied with our current relationship.
Please, anything but that!
Not getting that?
Okay...?
I can't... stop shaking...
Ghost photographs?
Umm... you should wash your hands once you get home...
You can never be too careful.
But I forgot everything she told me after I went home...
He asked me to bring Kuronuma.
Oh yeah, Chizuru told me she was going to Kuronuma's place today.
Can I use this?
Thank you so much! You didn't have to do all this!
Sawako got her eyebrows, eyes, and her nose from her father.
Wow, this is rare.
They're both such kind girls...
Eww, that's gross.
Kuronuma?
Shouldn't you have said, "I want to see you, too"?
And...
Why do I have to act like Pin's girlfriend?
No, that's not it! It's embarrassing!
I-I didn't want to get in the way between him and Sanada-kun!
And by the way, I know just about everything about Shota and Ryu.
If you ever want to know their weaknesses, just ask.
But man, it feels so good when your body is relaxed!
Everyone have a safe trip home, okay?
Huh?!
I'll try to walk home without scaring anyone! I swear!
If so, just speak up.
Pedro...
Night!
That jerk...
Don't blame me!
There's no knowing what I'll do!
Morning, Sawako!
Chizu-chan!
Yeah, you did.
I can do that every day, if you'd like.
R-Really?
I just realized that New Years is coming up.
S-Such a fresh look...
It's so sweet! Kazehaya-kun looks so happy when he's surrounded by everyone...
Back then, I used to think that hanging out with girls was a drag,
Oh, Ryu!
It's so cold out!
You mean 'chimera'?
Is there anything you want?
A-Actually, never mind.
Night!
Shopping?!
Oh, I can't.
I'm free.
Hang onto this for a sec.
Wow, that was a satisfying purchase!
So...
I knew it!!
But he only sees me as his little sister.
That's not true!
Th-That's just what I think.
It's okay!
That's why I'm going to grow up to be one hell of a babe.
I'm... glad I asked.
He didn't come home for this year's Bon Festival, so I literally haven't seen him for a year.
Huh?
That was embarrassing!
You've got plans already?
My bro's coming home.
What if Tohru only sticks around for New Year's Eve and the day after?
I didn't say anything, right?
I didn't like him after all.
Would you tell her if you were in my shoes?
Huh? Me?
Yeah.
So, this guy you like. I wonder what he looks like...
I'm so sorry, Yano-chin! Cheer up!
I'm invited?
Up until now, I've been so focused on trying to interact with other people.
Well...
Oh!
Morning!
Why?!
Gosh!
What are you getting mad for?
Let's go play his game, Chizu.
Bring the gift with you, too.
I'm the lead character, okay?!
Why are there so many people here?!
We're just having a party to cheer Joe up.
Two people with broken hearts start to console each other. Then slowly but steadily, love begins to blossom between them.
Tanaka, can you guys make some room?
Can you bring us more cups?
Oh.
What was it?
You're not even sorry at all!
So this is the person Chizu-chan is in love with...
Come on, introduce yourselves.
Wow, he's actually my type...
Hide her in a closet or something!
Get a hold of yourself!
Her name's Yoshida Chizuru.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
They're getting married...
You outsiders!
Have a safe trip home!
I live right over there!
If I were to say something to Chizuru in that situation,
I'm going to wear a mini skirt!
I wonder... if there's something we can do for her.
Oww, that hurt!
Tohru, I caught a bug!
Tohru, a bug!
I don't understand how I thought that was a good way to show my affection.
Tears that flow.
The one I like... is Ryu's older brother.
It's awkward to look him in the eye...
Because now, you'll be able to give up on him.
And on top of that, I said something that made her feel even worse...!
Just thinking about how powerless and useless we are?
I... guess this has something to do with Yoshida? Powerless... Powerless...
Hang on... Did you know who Chizu was in love with?
To be honest with you, I'm not sure if she's trying to act tough right now or if she's depressed down to the core.
Ironic how I just told you how easy she was to understand.
Useless! We're useless!
Personally, I'm relieved that it finally came down to this.
Hey, don't worry about it!
How can I cry when Chizu-chan's holding back her tears?
Until then, I'm going to act like I usually do.
I... wouldn't know.
Get me a half and half bread, an Elizabeth bread,
Huh?!
So you always thought I was hopeless in trying to make Tohru look at me?
Why don't you eat it?!
As if I could eat this much...
At least let me thank you for that gift.
Have a kleenex.
And then he goes on to say that he's relieved and that I'll be able to give up on Tohru!
Chizu...
God, it pisses me off!
I'm so sick of myself!
What's wrong? Go on!
If you don't take it out on someone now, you'll never get the chance to!
Ryu's definitely at fault here.
You worked hard, Chizu.
Keep complaining.
I'm so hungry!
In the end, I couldn't say anything to her that would cheer her up.
The stars twinkle in the night sky.
Then...!
My anger towards Ryu seems to have slightly disappeared.
I'm glad...
At Sanada-kun's place?
Yeah...
Come on.
Yeah.
I got everything done early so I could visit.
Glad to see you're as energetic as ever.
I just thought I'd take a stroll with you tonight instead.
And...
If I eat the sweet one, I'll crave the salty one...
Anman...!
I always woke up early when I was little...
What's that star?
So it must have been a winter constellation.
Remember that open field?
Ryu pisses me off so much!
He also never lies.
So you have these kinds of fights with Ryu now...
You're still twenty-four.
A neighbor is nothing but a neighbor.
Not the slightest.
I think of you as my little sister.
Hang on for a minute.
Huh?
Weren't you with Chizu?
Or are you picking a fight?
Neither.
You're probably the only person who remembered my birthday.
You have an excuse for not doing well this time.
Right?
You'll invite girls too, right?!
My first Christmas...
even if I do knit one, I wouldn't be able to give it to him.
Dad's home, dear!
You'd better get on with that, or he's going to have to stop taking requests!
Yeah.
Look at you, dear! Crying at the dinner table!
Nah.
Can't you drop by for just a brief moment?
I'm sorry this is kind of early, but...
I-I did.
Oh, this?
I'm getting too full of myself.
Sawako.
The bathroom's open!
I wasn't going to be able to give it to him, anyway...
You're not lonely, are you?
But since you can't, I have a christmas gift for you right here.
Thank you for taking care of my daughter all the time.
But...
...would you mind if I were to attend the party for just a little while?
It's from Santa...
I've charged it already.
Both the party and the gift exchange are over...
Sawako!
so I made him wait there for her.
And we all know what Sawako's like...
M-Morning!
It's actually a stomach band...
or maybe your grandfath-
But I can keep it for myself instead, right?
But I guess he wouldn't wear the hat either.
I've decided to take over my wife's family's sake-brewing business.
Mr. Arai...
Bow.
What? We just went yesterday!
Wow!
You're gonna read it all?
Thank you very much.
TLnote: ... It's better to use a lengthy address, to avoid getting spam.
Why don't you two come along with us this year?
I don't see why not.
I can make it...
...until school starts back up again.
W-Would like you to c-come with us for the visit first to the shrine of the year on New Eve's Year? TLnote: Yes, that's what she actually says.
It's like I'm dreaming...
Good evening!
W-What might this be...?
Looks great!
Good call, Yano-chin.
W-Where are you-
What are you getting cold feet for?
They tried to make me look a little prettier just for this moment...
Okay.
Ryu still isn't here.
...won't be here either.
...are those two doing?!
So, first, you tell me that the meetup point changed, and now what are we doing here?
Sorry! Sorry!
Yeah.
Shota and I were discussing about today, too...
Well, whatever.
Wait!
He really likes Kazehaya. He'll definitely find him!
Huh?
Hey, Joe, who are you with?
My rents!
What about your usual posse?
They're watching comedy shows at home!
Maybe Yano likes me...
They're gone!
I'm so happy...
I stuck a body warmer in one of the pockets.
It's really boring, though...
What about third and fourth grade?
Pine team.
I liked to play jumprope on my own.
I'd fasten a thing of rubber between two chairs, and jump over them.
I think I'm killing the happy mood...
I would have thought that you liked being alone.
You were always the one...
You're a lot easier to talk to now.
Three seconds!
What?
It's almost New Year's!
I want some amazake...
But...
Ryu!
You look so serious while saying that...
You guys are having too much fun with this.
Seems like it's going well after all.
You're going to come with me to receive blessings.
Five!
Had I not met all of you,
...still haven't memorized her name, have you.
Let's go get a written oracle.
Umm...
Since they're so rare.
Huh? Oh really?
How do I put it...
Now that I think about it...
What is wrong with you?!
Don't meet eyes with him...
Mind telling us your email address?
Why do you keep following me?!
I'm on my way home!
This is so good... I want to become one of those paper airplanes filling the sky. sono sora ippai no kamihikouki gurai ni natte
Hey! Tell me! arigatou ai wa hitsuyou to sareru Thank you. Love is able to flourish
Okay, just a peek! tanoshimetara iinoni the distance between us with a smile.
I'd like to tell you the feelings he's built up, tsutaetai kare ga tsumiageta omoi no choujou
Right? mienai watashi kara wa ne sono sekai no but I'm invisible.
Hey, why don't we get together and have a good time? What can I accomplish in this world? naka de watashi wa nani ni nareruno
What can I accomplish in this world? naka de watashi wa nani ni nareruno
though I want to keep watching you till the end of time. kono mama zutto miteitaikedo
Is Sawako still not home yet...? though I want to keep watching you till the end of time. kono mama zutto miteitaikedo
Night.
And someone that will inevitably cause me to become more greedy.
Sadako.
Before I knew it, I was the psychic aura girl.
Oh yeah, remember that rumor about Sadako?
Morning.
I think Sadako started it.
Let me through.
Just take it back.
You think you can beat me up?
Really? Yano and Yoshida helped Sadako?
Sadako's awesome.
but I want to be with you.
But they're listening to me, without even looking away.
Is that why you were hurt?
Dammit, I'm going to hug you all.
You hear that?
What?
I saw that, I totally saw that.
Seriously? Sadako 30th?
But the class average was up dramatically for some reason.
but I think everyone looks at me just a little differently these days.
I don't have a chance to be alone with her anymore!
I haven't had ramen in ages.
Sadako,
I love you.
Miyagawa said he likes Kurumi?
Hey, let's make sure she never has a chance with a guy she likes.
Yep! Practicing with the team?
I made sure never to tell anyone that I liked Kazehaya.
Although, I have nothing against being on the committee itself.
You're part of the festival committee too?
Like that'd ever happen!
It wouldn't surprise me if Kazehaya grew to like her.
What are you saying? You two get along great!
I just wanted to talk to Sawako-chan.
Trash?
Why?
I...
What if, before Kazehaya met Sawako-chan,
Even if I can't help you, I do know how you feel!
U... Ume-chan?
You don't know anything about him!
Anyway, that's how well I know Kazehaya.
What I have didn't happen overnight.
Sawako-chan is...
There's no point if Kazehaya doesn't like me back!gag
Ku... Kurumi-chan...
Do you really think Kazehaya-kun might come to like me?
I'm glad.
Sorry, Kurumizawa! I'm sorry!
I know. It's all over your face.
I want to give it to him...
Man it was sweet...
Oh, it's Sadako.
I'm giving some to Ryuu. And you, Yano-chin?
Maybe a card's not the best idea!
Plus, they're homemade.
Good morning!
Those were chocolates, weren't they?
I'm glad you all like them.
Oh...
Haha!Obligatory!
If I just smile and act natural when I give them to him, then maybe Kazehaya-kun will cheerfully accept...
Kazehaya, here are your chocolates!
What?
You got some too, Ryuu?
Rejected?
Right now I'm hooked on these drama reruns...
I have to stay for a bit, then I'll head home on my own.
He... He's leaving!
I stayed.
But what do I do now?
Gah! You little puke!
That bag of chocolates! Are those from Kuronuma?
Thank you.
You were eavesdropping? How tacky.
I-I-I'm sorry! I was somewhat, fairly, highly, exceedingly curious!
If that's all it takes to crush her plans, then so be it.
And what's wrong with this version?
Nope! I like the old her better.
Calling these a thank you gift was just an excuse.
I didn't mean to...
were my untold hopes.
They're not obligatory.
They are definitely not obligatory.
Hey, everybody!
Something must have happened on Valentine's day.
I suppose this means she's become aware of her feelings, but...
...if I'm being too selfish.
That one line by Akihiko was epic!
Too close!
Ooh! Now that's a scary face!
This is no time to be scared stiff!
I nominate Kuronuma-san for student-life leader.
Something up?
So you do smile.
All rise!
Good work!
Hey, Miura!
Oh, Tsuru!
Really?
Your last two years of high school will be some of the most eventful in your life.
In that most enjoyable period of your life...
Handsome?
You guys sure are close.
Kazehaya.
Besides...
So I can't tell you.
What do I do?
You're wrong.
I was very rude!
Yeah, I probably would have too.
You sure?
Good morning!
Good morning!
Yep.
That's why my patience is about to run out.
However...
She's worked so hard for so long.
But doesn't she like you too?
I want to be him!
When I think maybe they'll fall in love...
Does she really look that good to you?
L... Like I care!
What happened there? Some kind of illusion?
You'll be cursed with better grades!
I can even tell about three ghost stories.
I hope I can meet their expectations.
We were just about to begin.
Great, I'm just in time!
Takahashi-san!
Can you start from here?
Hey Sadako, why don't you use the chalkboard?
Uh, o...okay?
Hey, I've seen her smile before!
Teach us again sometime!
Sorry, could you go without me?
Kuronuma.
It's all right. You go first.
Don't be too bothered over it.
Pretend it never happened.
So, I'm sure tons of girls have confessed to you, haven't they? You have a girlfriend, right?
Is it such a good idea for you to get involved with her?
Did I hit a nerve? Forgive me.
Still, you have to feel bad for Sadako-chan.
I'm only doing what I think is right!
When did she ever hope for too much?
It's the biggest difference between you and Sadako-chan.
I can't say anything more than that.
You really do.
Hey, do you think Kuronuma and I are that different?
This dude still doesn't know she likes him.
So if you look at it that way, you might be the most distant from Sawako.
Actually, no, he didn't.
Remember that one odd, flashy guy?
That's perfectly normal...
I guess... so...
There's no way I can get in touch with him like this.
I'm scared.
Day duty?
I was caught off guard when Sawako started crying.
That hurt! What's going on?
Quit acting like you're avoiding Sawako.
Snapped?
That would be a relationship in name only, no different from what they have now.
Yeah, you're right.
What did you say?
Next episode: The One You Love.
You're welcome!
Constipation? Diuresis?
They say she's caused all sorts of curses ever since she came to this school!
She'd be like a fortune-teller!
Shiso.
Oh, that's rosemary.
Seriously?
I mean, this is a big event for you, too.
That was a great wedding ceremony.
Thank you very much!
No way. Support isn't my fort, and I'm no good at saying stuff I don't believe.
Shouta!
I guess I'll pay some mind to what Chizuru told me.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Aren't you happy?
It's always been my dream. It's just...
Isn't it best for you to stay away from Kazehaya?
Sadako-chan...
You could even fall in love again.
It's all right! Come on, Sadako-chan, where's that cute smile?
You were trying to cheer me up...
Aw, crap!
Come on, let's break it up here!
I did chase after him.
He was consoling me out of affection.
Still...
Yano-chin, let's go.
I...
Ouch! Do you think it's okay to be kicking your teacher?
What's with the talk of turning down and being turned down?
That face...
It makes me sick, Sawako.
What do you mean "painfully obvious"?
Chizu always snaps when she's frustrated or unhappy.
You come too after washing your face.
God! I just went ahead and did it! I'm so stupid!
I interrupted you when you were trying to say something.
So what were you trying to say?
Yeah I do. clephas note: slang here 'ppoku' is normally added on to the end of a noun to make it an adjective so it doesn't translate in any meaningful way, so you have to approximate
We just ran into her!
She rejected me.
Don't lump me with you.
Wasn't Kazehaya the one person who didn't pity you?
I've had my eyes on Kazehaya-kun for a very long time...
Yes, for the costume parade.
Of course!
Seriously, what are you gonna turn out to be? A gigolo? An escort? Or maybe...
Sure!
He turned me down.
You useless schmuck!
I said what I needed to say!
Um...
Thanks for giving me that text and calling me over...
And for what you said after school.
How long are you going to keep looking down on yourself?!
Now then, drinks...
Just a remark?
Hey!
What's going on?
I'm not really sure, but it looks like Sadako's denying some kind of relationship with Kazehaya.
But we have a situation here!
No.
I figured. Wait, this year too?!
I know I'm the one saying this...
Always only looking at his back, never exchanging greetings...
He might even avoid me.
Who gives a crap?
You didn't do anything to Sawako, did you?
So it's true that Kazehaya really likes Sadako-chan?
I'm sorry.
I was being affectionate.
Wasn't Kazehaya the one person who didn't pity you?
Admirable?
They're for the Black Magic Caf.
Let me see.
Yeah, pre-occupied with myself.
Kuronuma's rep has taken a life of its own.
Is she that powerful?!
Constipation.
If Kazehaya-kun didn't already like another girl... Would I have done something differently?
A wall that didn't exist between you and any of your other classmates.
Misunderstood?
We hear it works wonders!
You're fine not getting in her way?
and his broad smile.
Let them reach him.
About what?
I want you to listen.
Just one person changed my life.
I love you. I love you.
Yeah, like I can depend on you girls.
K... Kuronuma...
Don't look away. Look at me.
It feels like I haven't seen you face to face in ages. Edit: Previous Line for Reference: It feels like ive never seen you directly face to face for a very long while.
I don't care!
Now, here's the thing... At tomorrow's costume parade during your solo, you should take these...
He said his feelings aren't going to change, but I don't know what to do!
You mean a Pin Blitzkrieg Alert?
What? You mean you aren't filled with puppy-eyed wonder, dammit?!
Hey, he said that Pin also dropped in on the boys!
But my mind is clear.
to see her...
we're having ramen tonight.
I never thought I needed one.
Oh, I guess.
What's your order?
I just said I recommend miso.
Not enough water.
How can you let your customers notice before you do?
It's really good.
Yeah, make yourselves at home.
Miso ramen's the best ramen.
You too, Chizu.
What a perfect time for you to come in.
Um, wait...
I knew it!
I'm the older brother.
I want him to come.
It's Ryu.
It's Kuronuma.
It's easy.
Shouta's good at baseball.
I wish I could see him.
I get to see Kazehaya-kun as he'll be from now on.
Not my type.
You have a type?
Sadako, I mean Sawako,
You're, like, a girl.
And you have no manners since you're a regular at Ryu's place.
Oh my.
He has a face like this as well...
We're going to have lots of fun.
What do you want me to do?
Oh yeah,
what kind of girl do you like?
It was so fun.
With me too?
Next episode: Self-Practice
Sawako, you okay?
Yep, it's all happening tomorrow.
Why are we still building this stupid float?
Are you all done?
You've seen the girls?
I really wanted to use some rouge or lam, but I had to focus on the intensity.
So Sadako is Okiku from Banchou Sarayashiki.
Thank god we've finished the float and costumes in time.
I'm a growing boy.
Who knows? Just go with whatever.
Yano!
Where's Kuronuma?
Sawako made that thing you're wearing.
Now he's Mr. All-wide-eyed-and-excited?
Make sure you do what I said during your solo part.
Oh, I should be thanking you...
Huh?
A lot of things changed since I met Kazehaya-kun.
I was praising you!
It's definitely a bribe.
First place for the wall posters goes to...
I thought it was impossible...
Oh, Sawako went to the after-party for the school festival.
That's still years away, honey.
I wonder if those two are already there.
"Were you waiting?"
"I just got here."
Or maybe they'll decide not to come!
I love you!
Joe. Can I take a swing at you?
What do you mean by "it's the same"?
I'm fine with that.
Oh my God, how cute!
Don't worry, it'll only take a minute.
Quiet, you're being too loud!
You two going out?
No, but I'm sure she understfscx200-
You dumbass! You think she's able to pick up on these things?
Kuronuma.
Yes?
Are you saying that talk about marriage was a misunderstanding?
I was wondering if my imagination could create that amazing image.
What is it?
I guess we don't have to worry then! re-time, comes in early
Got that right. Now I feel kind of sorry about saying "you're the most distant from Sawako".
Freaky! That means she's literally controlling him!
Yeah, nothing to worry about here.
So what you're saying is true?
It is!
What is Sawako to you?
Girlfriend?
So this is how it all ties together?
They're a good couple.
I didn't actually mean to do that...
No. Thank you.
I'm glad.
They keep popping up as if I'm dreaming about them.
Then next I see Kurumi-chan's face.
Yeah.
We should have been harsher if we knew this was going to happen. Edit: Original Line "If we knew this is what was going to happen, we should have been harsher."
What? Are you looking for a fight?
That's impossible!
You know what'll happen if we tell Kazehaya, don't you?
You didn't know?
Would you have given up if he had picked Kurumi?
So why do you ignore your faults and blame Sawako?
You all didn't originally have a grudge against Sawako, right?
Not for Kazehaya, but for you.
Please, I didn't do anything.
What?
I'm going out with him.
So what?
Now, for example, if things went well between Sadako-chan and I... probably never crossed your mind, right?
...and Sadako-chan's cuter than I thought.
It's a good thing I didn't fall for her sooner.
You're sweeter than I thought, Ayane.
Let's sit here.
I'm so happy.
The Sadako Notes right?
No, not at all.
I remember seeing her with Kazehaya.
If anything it would be you.
I'm so surprised and I can't explain it,
No one's ever said that about me.
Call me Ekko.
Chizu-chan and Ayane-chan.
Thanks for filling in for me.
Morning.
Kun?
Guys.
a guy.
We're choosing the sports day committee today.
He didn't even let anyone volunteer.
I can barely control myself,
You look pretty slow.
Do it.
Okay.
Huh?
She might even scare the opponents that way.
Lunch break is too short.
I need to practice alone.
I've never seen him exercising.
We better go back.
We're going to be late for fifth period.
We're heading back.
Let's go, Kazehaya.
Really?
Done!
No.
Thanks.
It's not for personal use.
I'll use my New Year's gift money.
Okay, I'll bring it next time.
Wait, wasn't she over there just now?
When did she...?
The boys aren't back yet from sports day practice.
Like one of those dolls that grow hair.
That's the first time anyone's said that about me.looks like the steelers logo
We totally can.
Nice.
Kuroyama Takako?
It's for Sawako's sake, you know.
A fluffy perm.
A perm?!
I just had an unearthly image run through my head.
Sounds good. Make it brown.
I got envious.
Sadako.
Ekko.
I'm waiting for them.
Yeah.
Sa...
I got nervous.
She sure is nice.
I never knew they were friends.
Right, Sawako-chan?
Yeah, fa
Frie
Sawako!
Sawako-chan!
you head straight that way.
You know what I mean?
Grind the ball out?
What?
How can you tell, Yano-chin?
Because you're simple-minded.
Bye bye.
What's up with them?
Don't you get it?
Hold on.
This is my job.
Bring it on pitcher!
Maybe boys and girls are too different.
But then again, you're so different from Kazehaya.
O-Okay.
Morning, Kuronuma.
Wait
So then she confessed to him and got rejected.
Chizu-chan, can you help with her too?
Dammit! I'm done!
I sort of know what she's really like now.
Okay.
Ka
Shit, I called her name but now I'm nervous.
Kazehaya-kun was thinking the same thing I was.
Sure, I think.
Why does someone always get in the way?
You know, there's someone I like.
I wonder what I should do.
Wh
Actually, I want you to help me.
I'm going to Tokyo.
i1I still want to meet you.
i1We weren't lovers back then...
We're going to the Tokyo Dome to watch a baseball game,
But only an hour!
Be at the entrance by 5 PM!
Sorry, gotta run!
What's the point? After you meet him, you'll be even lonelier.
I didn't think you'd come for me, Kanzaki.
I have a friend who moved here after elementary school.
And what does that have to do with me pretending to be your boyfriend?
So I told her that I have a boyfriend too...
Tokyo people have so much time.
We were doing a caf for the fair, and we used our apples.
Why...
My family's running a specialtyshoubara-yaki, a kind of hiroshima meal restaurant!
Yeah! We're going out! We're making out too!classy move
You guys are cute together, though.
Feelings change.
Don't worry about it.
Bye-bye!
Okay, then just in case, I'll distract the teacher!
Gee, that's so out of character coming from you. Creepy!
What if she has a boyfriend and she's going on a date?
You're worrying too much.
I'll call the police about our stalker problem.
I'm going back with you.
I don't want to go to Tokyo.
She just forced herself to smile.
Yet...
But then I let you see that...
So beautiful!
By the way...
All this time.
I didn't want to come here at all!
I've no choice, huh?
A nice place?
Is this the nice place?
They're on the lake too, aren't they?
Then it doesn't have to be long-distance!
I...
I'll come to meet you again.
Then go to Tokyo alone!
No, I was.
haFor a while we'll be far apart,
Our long distance relationship
I thought I ought to tell you, just in case...
so go on with the person next to you, instead.
She told me to go ahead and wait for her.
Wow... what a set-up.
She must've meant to do this from the start.
But...
No, there's some stuff I'd like to see as well.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Well, seems like this challenge was invalid.
Going to work right after a date.
You should really cut it out.
My sister told me, but that's a pretty flimsy excuse.
That's because...
How was Rin-chan?
I'm sorry about falling asleep like that yesterday.
Did you just get back?
Yeah...
Is Rin-chan getting crazy ideas again?
I haven't been visiting since then either,
We're going to Okinawa.
Well, good luck with work.
Thanks, be careful when you head out.
Don't say things like that out of the blue.
The tea fell over.
Yeah...
I'm home!
Huh?
Something better.
Really?
Asuka?
It's decided, then.
That's a pushy way to call people over.
Ah.
You must feel lonely without your girlfriend,
Let me go!
So don't worry about it...
Might you be cheating on me?
It's an ice flower.
Eh?
Stay with me forever.
Give up on your trip to Tokyo, and go out with me.
I definitely won't be able to go back to Tokyo.
Isn't that Haruto-san?
Rin-chan!
Ah, remembering something nice?
Eh?
She just came here.I ran into her right now
Amazing!
This fried egg is delicious.
Let's see...
It was my fault, so...
There's no need to apologise.
Well...
A-Ah... like that, like that.
Where were you two?
Rin-chan.
I'm already full.
Haruto-kun... I...
She points at the water's surface, reflecting the fireworks...
I see.
Just a bit under the weather.I'M SORRY. I WILL NEVER DO PUNS AGAIN.
Hey, didn't you want to go to the beach with everyone else?
It's beautiful!
Tough luck.
I give up.
In spite of all that... What am I even doing?
You don't cry over nothing.
Eh?
Asuka...
I understand. We'll talk later then.
Really?
Well, I guess that's true.
Yeah, probably.
Hey!
Instead of keeping it to yourself, why don't you try talking to me?
Isn't it a bit late for that?
Either way... Give it your best, okay?
I told her there was no way that would make me glad.
I couldn't ever be truly happy like that.
or how much I'm detested, as long as I can be with the one I love.
Well then, we'll take on everything together.
Hey you...
I made Asuka cry.
Yeah.
It seems like Rin said some mean things, I'm sorry.
Say...
Yeah. I'm tired of always living with my sister.
but I can only remember the fun times.
If I knew I'd be having these thoughts...
If things don't work out with Yuzuki-chan, you can always come back.
I'm over here!
What's wrong, Haruto?
You're clearly the burglar here.
Shouldn't you have said so earlier?
Please hold on a second!
While we're at it, please fix that weird way of speaking.
H-How do you do.
You're quite the cool guy.
It's not every day you make new friends.
Who knows.
In that case, ain't you the same as me?
What?
We don't have patrol cars blaring their sirens and roaming around back at our place.
Amazing!
I think you should speak louder.
I ate his cooking yesterday.
Kirishima, have you decided on a club yet?
Chef?
We're organising a welcome party so we can all go out together.
My bad, my boss asked me to stay for a drink.
Is that all right?
Good timing!
Say, you tend to come straight home after school.
I didn't think it was a bother.
I'm sorry.
Sorry, let's drop this topic.
What is?
F-For real?
That makes you a complete stalker.
No wonder she's avoiding you.
I came here for that reason.
Then, I'll just get her to come out.
You should show her around school if you're free.
What?
The air is delicious!
My bad.
Hello!
I'm Kanzaki Nanami.
Nanami-chan is really cute.
She's got a great figure too.
I think I got it.
Eh?
That's right.
I'll catch you later, then.
Hop on, we're going back.
S-Sure.
Of course!
Seriously...
Good morning, Yuzuki-chan!
Hey, so that's the girl?
The one from Tokyo who's living together with Haruton.
I've been classmates with Haruto since elementary school.
Sure!
I specifically told her to wait at the convenience store!
Are you all right, Eba-san?
Wow!
I can hear everything here.
Seriously, she just does whatever she wants.
Kirishima-kun!
But somehow, I might have seen her crying.
What's the meaning of that!?
You're seriously really annoying!
Kirishima-kun seems to be in a bad mood.
No idea.
Sure.
I'll be fine, though.
Hey, what do you think you're doing!?
How are you feeling?
Like I said, you need to rest.
If I took a break, you wouldn't have your bento and you'd struggle to get to school.
Onii-chan?
Oh, the bike magazine?
He's Kirishima-kun.
Eba-san is here, too.
Earlier on... t-that kiss.
I've had it!
After all, you prefer it that way!
I'm doing just that even without you saying it!
Why are you the one who's angry about this?
You should take the day off from school.
She said Takashi-kun will be bringing her home.
Well... it's just that Yuzuki-chan seems a bit down today.
Haruto-kun, why?
"Eh" nothing! We're going home!
I can't help it.
I apologise.
Eh?
What have you been doing?
Nee-chan! It was Nee-chan.
You're putting on that gloomy expression again.
Didn't I tell you?
I'd do whatever it takes, so please, I'm begging you!
Could you pass me that wrench?
Are you sure that's all right?
Well, I'll be going in any case.
I'll help you with Nagoshi.
Minus one!
Staring at your smartphone while on a date...
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, don't come so close.
I-I will...
I've already seen your true colours!
Besides, there might be a revival round. You never know.
On!
Feels even better?
What do you think, Kirishima?
Quite the girl, don't you think? My darling.
Well...
Yeah.
What's wrong with you?
You too, what's up with you?
As long as they've got some, it's fine.
Get out there and earn some money.
Your friend accompanied you here because he was worried.
I'm really sorry, Kirishima-kun.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have specifically contacted her.
I thought you were unconscious?
My bad.
Oh... no...
Didn't I tell you?
Why don't you know?
Either way, you only have one choice.
But don't you think that girl is a bit heartless?
Eh?
Actually, you hope she wouldn't be happy.
Stop trying to act cool.
So go snatch her back, Kirishima.
I told you before about a very interesting transfer student who came, right?
Nee-chan will be home soon.
Wait for me, Kirishima!
Kyousuke's girlfriend is really cute.
Are you really serious?
I even reminded you about it before we left.
D-Don't worry about it.
The sky is blue...
That's a misunderstanding!
and do mine while she was at it.
Ah... what am I even doing?
Kanzaki?
Could you return this book I borrowed from her?
Eh?
Yeah, when I tried to explain to her that I wasn't going out with Eba.
How did she misunderstand your explanation?
Huh?
Hey, could you support the rear for me?He has to keep the bike level
Did you, by any chance, hear that from Takashi?
W-What are you saying?
It'd be your loss.
Then, who is she?
Weren't we in fourth grade?Forth year student
I guess it can't be helped.
I'm scared.
Just wait.
The truth is, there were a lot of things I don't like,
but somehow, I thought that everything would be all right.
How nostalgic! You drew what happened in a picture diary?
I can't go out with Haruto-kun any longer.
She's really fast!She refers to the motorcycle
Come on, it's fine.
The bread won't taste as delicious when you eat alone, right?
Well then, I'll eat here.
Nobody had talked to me like that, before.
it'll just make me more miserable.
No!
Stop it, Eba.
There are so many things that we'll never be able to understand with our tiny heads.
My food is delicious, you know.
Hey! I'm going.
You're lying.
Eba...
I met Eba when we were little.
What are you talking about so sudden...
What will you do? Now that it's turned out like this.
Besides, I was the one who told you to take her back.
Hold on!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you were here, Kazama?
I won't.
We should head back home now, Kirishima.
If I go home, there's no telling what he'll do.
Well, I think I'll go as well.
I had something to say, so I waited.
You shouldn't look so depressed in front of him.
Yeah, and...
It'd take me two days to make you a beef stroganov.
Kiyomi.
Yeah, but the chances of success are very low,
N-No way.
Wait!
We're pretty mean, aren't we?
Complete idiots.
Yo!
Yeah. It tastes great if you haven't had it in a while.
Huh? What's up?
What? You waited for me?
Yeah.
Wait up, Kirishima!
Yeah...
Why are you saying that? That's my line.
Kirishima-kun.
He made it seem delicious.
Kyousuke-kun said he wanted to show you something.
It'd be embarrassing to do it wrong, so tell me.
How can you act calm, like as if nothing happened?
Kyousuke would get mad at me if I looked like this.
Yeah.
Sorry, did you wait?
So smile, for his sake.
Right?
I swore.
What, were you still sleeping?
I brought some vegetables from the countryside.
I feel like anything I do will be fun, if I do it with you.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
I also have a girlfriend now.
Thanks for waiting.
I'm not used to it yet, but I'm fine.
Hey Asuka, you in there?
Looks like she isn't here.
Asuka, if you're here...
I'm surprised. It's been around a year and a half since we last met.
See? He's an interesting guy.
Eh, but it's only nine o'clock.
No I don't. I have a very strict curfew.
I couldn't keep up with Icchii-senpai's tension.
Oh right, I ran into Rin-chan the other day.
Hiroshima... That brings back memories...
Well, I'm going this way now.
Eh?
What's yours?
See you again... huh.
Asuka! What are you doing at this time?
Ah, like that.
Rin-chan, can you hold this for a moment?
But... but it still manages to make me angry!
Huh?
What? You came again?
Haruto-san, you're so nice.
i1But...
You can have 'em.

The early warning system?
It's all right.
Come up with an escape plan?
The high school is outside the disaster area,
You're in the Broadcast Club.
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?
Oh! So that's why...
Just be quiet.
The comet's going to break apart and fall?
You shouldn't go!
Yotsuha, before nightfall, take Grandma and get out of town.
Tokyo?
Hello? Mitsuha?
Couldn't say.
i1Don't you remember me?
i1And I was the one who was within you.
Mitsuha!
Taki, where are you? I know you're here!

Who?
For sure. Saw it with my own eyes!
We're both criminals now!

Stay put, they said.

i1Hey. Who are you?
Sis?
It was almost like a scene from a dream.
i1This feeling possessed me somewhere along the way.
To build a cityscape...
i1I'm not really sure, myself.
You were in high school back then, so it must have been...
Five years.
i1The entire town happened to be holding an emergency drill,
You said you wanted a wedding in a chapel.

You were totally possessed.
Straighten up!
In front of everybody, too.
"Tasokare" means "Who's that in the gloom," and it's where the word "gloaming" comes from.
When the world blurs and you might encounter something not quite human.
I hear that Itomori's elderly still use old-timey language here and there.
You had bedhead and no ribbon.
I just want to graduate and go to Tokyo.
I mean... how 'bout we stop by a caf?
Really?
The Great Fire of Mayugorou.
But even not knowin, tradition should still be handed down.

Have another, my friend.
Yes, dear.
Hey.
Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sak" or somethin.
I'm sick of this life!
Where...
You overslept.
Okay.
I reckon a guy like me's got to enjoy himself every now and then. It's so festive in Tokyo, y'know?
Where's your lunch?
Got anything?
Good woodwork up there.
Yes sir!
When is this dream going to end?
I do hope you weren't hurt.
Okudera, your skirt!

Oh! I-I'll look the other way!
You really saved me today.

Get a move on!sliding door clip

Switching bodies!?
I switch with Mitsuha at random,
But I...
I don't know myself, thanks to Mayugorou.

It's the next world!
Oh, yeah.
i1You've got a date with Okudera tomorrow!
i1She'll be at the station at 10:30.
Shall we?
i1I want to go on this date,
She's making fun of me.
Let's call it a day.
Taki, you
Admit it. You just want to see her in a yukata.
C'mon.
She get ditched?
i1never swapped again.
Takagi's got work covered.
Well, no, not exactly.
The switching stopped.
And you can't contact her.
This isn't going to work...
Yeah, it's Itomori, all right.
Itomori?
i1The comet Tiamat had an orbital period of 1,200 years.
i1No one predicted that its nucleus would split at that moment.
At 8:42 in the evening.
It struck where people were gathered for the festival.
And now, no one lives in the town at all.
And Sayaka.
Was I just delusional?
Thanks for sticking with me.
Why don't you go take a bath, too?
That picture of Itomori you made...
and this one is mine.

Stop! A single girl your agethat ain't proper!
You do the broadcast.
Why!?
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?
If you're being serious with me, then you are ill.
I'll get someone to drive you to the city hospital.
Let's meet at the shrine.
You'll die if you stay here!
Please!
i1The number you are trying to reach is not available
i1Or maybe, just maybe,
i1Three years ago, I had a moment with you.
Taki?
Taki!
I drank your kuchikamisake.
'Course I didn't recognize you.
Sorry.
Seriously, you're such an...

Who was it?
Who did I come to see?
For sure. Saw it with my own eyes!
Damned if I know!

Figure out where it's coming from!
What's going on?

How many interviews have you had so far?
Five years.
Thanks for today. I can take it from here.

Wow, they feel so realistic...
"Sis"? Me?
A comet that comes only once every 1,200 years will finally be headed our way in a month.

It's only when all these goals are achieved that a safe and secure community can be assured!

A poetic, bittersweet time known for encounters with the supernatural.
Some people also call it "golden hour."

It's not like threads talk.

How's the datin' scene?
They're lookers, all right. Just like their mother.
Apparently it's the world's oldest kind of sake.
My apologies.
Okay.
Who's that?
What's up with you?
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!
Taki!
Oh, yes?
See this? Does it look right? A toothpick's in it.
Why, thank you.
Ms. Okudera.
Come with me.
You aren't that strong,
He's so organized.
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.
Later.
Right, Taki?
Doesn't matter who wins. Nothin'll change.

Okay.
The comet?
But why?
Yeah. Uh, no... Um...
I just got here.
They must be together around now...
an8This is nice. It's my first time here.
Let's call it a day.
It's not like that.
No, I just didn't feel like going, that's all.
Okay, got it.
Maybe your call annoyed her.
She just felt like cuttin' off that much of it?
You can't go alone.
Catfished?
Seriously.
You're a terrible tour guide.
Yeah, it's Itomori.
Itomori?
Hey.
Is this really the place?
These mountains.
Hundreds of people died?
I...
But I'm sure he met someone, and that someone's why he changed.
I recognized the scenery because I unconsciously remembered the news from three years ago.
Or did I just... make it up?
Oh, Ms. Okudera.
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?
Why don't you go take a bath, too?
The threads twist, tangle, unravel, break, and reconnect.
Taki...
You're going to be a big sister.
Oh yeah, the comet.
I'm leaving without her.
Grandma?
When I was a young girl,
What if all those dreams that the Miyamizu family had all had to do with today?
Yeah, those speakers all over town.
Got the snacks.
Sorry for the trouble.
Some pay this is.
Got an evacuation plan?
A bomb?
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning from the school.
You're in the broadcast club.
I'm in charge of explosives.
Hey, help me out here!
Get out of town.
Hey, Mitsuha?
Does that mean...
Mitsuha!
It's Mitsuha.
Taki, where are you?
Taki...
It's really you.
It wasn't easy, since you were pretty far away.
I drank your kuchikamisake.
Your name is Mitsuha.
Why did I come here?
What's your name?
I really have to do it?
What was that?
Hey, look up there!
an8An explosion has occurred at the electrical substation.

Tessie!

Oh, Mitsuha.
The high school?
Haven't we met?
i1I think I know when this feeling possessed me.
Dream Lantern
Onee-chan, what're you doing?
Morning.
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.
Oh well.
Study hard!
I reckon Mitsuha's just stressed. Right?
Finally, and most importantly,
and "kawatare-doki."
Like a dream about someone else's life?
Never mind.
Maybe it's stress?
Aw, don't remind me!
I can't take this town anymore.
Hello.
Don't you worry.
We've both got it rough, huh?
Hey.
It's the oldest sak in the world.
Hey, why not chew up a bunch of that sak and use the money to go to Tokyo?Hey, why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and use the money to go to Tokyo?
It'll sell!
No! That's against the liquor laws.
I have to pee.
At least you sound apologetic.
Stud?
Guy?
A hundred years ago, maybe.
When is this dream going to end?
But... there are no toothpicks in an Italian restaurant'swhat if there just wasn't an enem dash here? would that work? you know, I don't like how enem dashes ruin the surprise of interruption in some lines, and this is one of those lines.
Oh, really?
Are you hurt?
Senpai, come with me.
It looks really cute!
He's acting normal today.
Hello.
Right, Taki-kun?
i1But...i0
What? He's famous!
Here, Grandma.
I want some too!
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."
It's the next world!
Kuchikamisake...
Okudera-senpai?
What's she talking about?
Well, I guess I set him up.
I'm...
Let's call it a day.
N-No, I don't.
Look! You can see it!
Takagi's got work covered.
I got your back! But you owe me lunch sometime.
A con act?
Yes.
Are you kidding me?
So annoying.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's Itomori, all right.
I remember this high school clearly!
Surely you remember that disaster that took hundreds of lives three years ago!
Died?
i1No one predicted that its nucleus would split at that moment.
At 8:42 in the evening.
Tessie.
There has to be some kind of mistake. I mean, she died three years ago!
Doesn't that
What did I...
Lively up there.
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.
Her name...
What was it?
It's okay.
I wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm.
Don't you remember me?
That was good.
and this one is mine.
then give me one last chance.
i1Who cares about the shrine!?
i1Get out of here!
i1They say it'll look brightest tonight.
an8i1Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee at around 7:40,
You knew?
Although now I've forgotten about whose life I was dreaming about.
I won't let them die!
That means it's time for us to get to work!
Why!?
You're in the Broadcast Club.
Well, I guess y'all can cook up whatever you want.
Oh! So that's why...
If you're being serious with me, then you are ill.
You...
You arrogant son of a bitch!
Tokyo?
Hey, what the... Mitsuha!
Please!
I...
i1Taki-kun!
What for?
i1If I showed up out of the blue, would it bother him? Surprise him?
i1he'd be a bit glad to see me?
i1I know one thing for sure.
I'm sorry.
Twilight is almost...
...over.
Here.
I swear I'll find you again.
...are you?
i1It's okay. I'll remember. I'll never forget!
Evacuate?
We don't have enough time. Mitsuha!
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!
Go on to your dad and bring him around!
an8i1Again, residents of the following areas,
What's going on?
Katsuhiko!
Sorry, Mitsuha.
It broke!
i1I...
Oh, you're job-hunting.
You don't think it's because of the suit?
Does it look that bad?
That many?
i1and most of the locals had already been evacuated from the impact zone.
I want to look at a Shinto-style ceremony.
I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?
Excuse me!
I thought so, too!
But...
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!
Oh well.
We do not!
Hey, Miyamizu.
"Tasokare" Twilight
Twilight, when it's neither day nor night.
Nothing.
No brides.
- Give me a break! - What?
Hello.
Hey, Tessie.
I smell corruption.
"Kuchikamizake." Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?
That's the problem?
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!
This is too realistic.
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.
How could you get lost on the way to school?
What? I could live for a month for the price of these!
Excuse me.
Oh, Okudera-san, your skirt!
Hey, Taki!
You're weak but quick-tempered.
I like you better today.
You walked home with her!
What happened afterwards?
But...
I don't know because of Mayugorou.
Whoa, Onee-chan.
This word has profound meaning.
Tying thread is Musubi. Connecting people is Musubi.
These are all the god's power.
That's also Musubi.
So today's offering
Hey, I see it!
It's the underworld!
He's so lucky. They must be together around now...
I...
Let's call it a day.
No, I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine.
OK, got it. Later, then.
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.
So it's impossible after all...
made a close approach to Earth 3 years ago in October.
Tessie and Sayaka...
Eat this up there.
It wasn't just a dream!
Don't be full of yourself. Not like YOU have a girlfriend.
No, but watching the way you behaved lately triggered some memories.
Forget that! If nothing is done, everyone will die tonight!
The community wireless system?
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!
It's a perfect plan.
Not necessarily! Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?
If you're serious, then you're sick.
I'll listen to you after a doctor examines you.
Mitsuha! No...
What are you saying?
What are you doing?
Is something over there?
What? Now?
Taki-kun!
Taki-kun!
You drank that?
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me before I knew you?
Hey, Mitsuha?
It's OK. I remember.
Who are you?
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.
When the town's power goes out, the equipment there should work on backup.
Hey, look!
The broadcast isn't from here? Who is it, then?
Let's go, Mitsuha!
The Takayama sensor station called!
To build a city's landscape...
What brings you here today?
- 5 years ago. - That long?
Thanks for today. This is far enough.
You be happy someday too.
You can eat it.
'Mornin, Saya! 'Mornin, Tessie.
You two sure would make a great couple!
Huh? What are you guys talking about?
It's only when all these goals are achieved that a safe and secure community can be assured!
In front of everyone...
I'm sure you're all familiar with the word.
It's a term that's mostly used in photography and cinema.
Cut the crap.
That's what's weird.
Can't say I blame ya.
There's only one train every 2 hours.
What?
I'll probably keep on livin' a normal life in this town.
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.
But that foolish son-in-law of mine...
I've had enough of this town!
Ouch...
Daikanyama.
Guess who's opening at our next gig...
A girl?
I mean...
A guy!
What's up with you?
Thank you.
Oh!
Waiter.
What do you have to say?
Excuse me.
Why, thank you.
We just had some bad luck, is all.
Bet it was a set-up.
I handled it according to restaurant policy, but...
Hey, Taki!
You aren't that strong,
Oh!
The hell is this?
Huh?
Oh really, now?
We're switching places?
I cannot believe this girl!
an8I cannot believe this guy!
Who's that?
The name refers to "tying," and has profound meanin'.
So the braided cords that we make are the art of the god,
The kuchikamisake.
Yeah. Uh, no... Um...
For real?
Sorry if I'm wrong.
It's not like that.
Thanks for today.
Well...
an8Finally!
You think it's about some guy after all?
Hey! I can see it!
This isn't funny.
It's because you've been acting weird lately.
Isn't it, dear?
Yes!
Itomori?
No way!
Isn't that where that comet...
No, I didn't.
There's no way you could.
Died three years ago?
and now nobody lives in Itomori at all.
That's her?
Like he was trying really hard.
What he's saying still doesn't make sense to me...
I'm really sorry, but thanks.
Maybe at that place...
i1Taki!i0
It was good.
It's there.
and this was mine.
Our times got tangled somehow.
I'm going to Tokyo.
Mitsuha! Don't stay there!
Mitsuha, run!
Mitsuha!
and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's surface.
'Morning, Mitsuha.
Grandma?
When I was a young girl,
Treasure the experience.
I went through similar times myself, and so did your mother.
If we don't do something about tonight, we'll all die!
The alert system?
That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!
Here's your change.
Some pay this is.
So, what'd ya come up with?
What?
Broadcast hijacking?
The town's wireless system can easily be overridden using its squelch tone.
So a meteor did strike this area a thousand years ago!
Like I said,
You...
And why'd you go to Tokyo yesterday?
It's gone.
an8Next is Yotsuya. Yotsuya.
Taki.
Taki, where are you?
Taki, are you...
It's magic hour.
Taki...
It wasn't easy, since you were pretty far away.
Here.
I kept it for three years.
No, I... Sorry.
Why've you gotta be like that?
You still have enough time.
...over.
So we don't forget when we wake up...
Let's write down our names.
I wanted to tell you.
Wherever you are in the world,
Oh, to hell with it!
What was that?

an8Residents in the following areas, please evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.
Forest fire!
You've gotta convince your old man!

Come on, you all need to evacuate!
Tidal forces don't seem to have affected...
Dad!
You were still in high school, so that was...
Five years ago.
Can I ask you...
All my expenses, from school tuition to apartment rent,
is the Ichinomiya familys doctrine:
For generations, a necktie heirloom with those words has been passed to the eldest son of the Ichinomiya family.
No, how could that be? Youre just imagining things.
When I was a year old,
Someone!
and yet
Why was my life saved by a girl like this?
Thats it.
Plus, its dangerous for a girl to live here alone.
I have eight hundred million or so to spend freely.

I dont know what kind of suspicious doctrines hell teach.
Oh, me!
Sisters cookies are really yummy.
but my determination is real.
Make Nino happy.
Hes a nice guy?
To those who are lost, I say unto them,
i1Like leaving your mother's body
i1Like being outside, wrapped in your father's arms,
Okay, then let's stay!
I'm way more reliable than some tenderfoot trying to turn tail and run.
i1Before you is the main office of a major company called Goes.
Oh, this. Rec told me I should wear a disguise to avoid attracting attention from the police.
What happened to you?
Actually, three seconds is plenty.
No, he's the manager!
They're all very well trained.
Right? The deadline's nowhere in sight. Why should we waste our time down here?
Who the hell was that?
If these people don't want us down here, they should just tell us to our face.
You feeling okay? You haven't had any fish for three whole days.
I hate to admit it, but you might be the only one who can help Nino this time.
Once he wakes up from his suspended animation, he'll be chock-full of energy!
SuspendedDid you stop his heart or something?
Redevelop the plan. Immediately.
Why didn't you negotiate with your father first?
i1If he were a man who could be negotiated with,
Wow, it's really easy to follow. I'd expect no less of you, Rec.
Don't try to come off like you're thinking of everyone.
Well I thought...
The construction company canceled?
When's a good time to call you, usually?
As you can see...
Not one damn scratch!
Nino...
Hey, come on.
Show me what it means to be a man, Hoshi.
You look great!

This is just like a rollercoaster!
What?! Where's the Minister?
Actually, I've been instructed not to forward your calls to him anymore.
There's really nothing more to say, so if you'll excuse me.
How?!
The government couldn't care less about that speck of land.
I have the weekly report on Ko.
The report...
That's it!
i1No matter
i1How unexpected.
Actually... we're getting kicked out of our homes.
My lover's doing everything he can for us.
Here? Now?
Are you sure you don't need glasses?
Stop! Ah, I have to do something
Found it!
i1until you can no longer stand.

Oh, Rec! Hey, I don't know
Oh, you're right.
i1And...
Great! Then why don't you go first, Rec?
Sure...
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?!
Umm... kan...
The bridge is destroyed! So are everyone's houses!
Nino...
I dunno, I just use the pressure of the deep.
It's a knight's duty to protect his princess from the darkness!
Nino! Don't get it cut, okay? Seriously!
Do you mind sitting on these folding chairs?
I can't help it!
If I just layered it here...
i1That was an everyday Ryoma!
Ahh, is this what you call a "generation gap"?
Sister, this is much more dangerous if you can't stop dodging.
i1Forbidden?! That's way too deep and inappropriate to be discussed down here!
Kids, please pay attention during cla
i1The twins were trapped at the lab, and then came here right afterward.
I'll take you to the fair tomorrow.
Rec!
Master Ko, all dooone!
my strength and determination can make any dreamland a reality!
What is it? Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.
I heard about the fair.
Yo, took ya long enough! The dreamland was getting tired of waiting for you.
Welcome, friends.
i1And this is only the entrance...
Welcome, Stella. Would you like to take a ride?
It's not like we went to a lot of fairs when we were little.
All I had back then was, like, a river near a village, where my pops took me once in a while.
My commanding officer would often take me to the front lines.
i1Well... I'm sure it took a lot of work to build a full-on rollercoaster.
Make sure the belt and handcuffs are securely fastened.
Yup!
so much fun!
That was...
Togetheryou and me and everyone else.
Rec, c'mon! Let's go!
i1I wonder if they'll remember this day later on in their lives.
i1And me, too.
i1The emotions we shed.
i1These are the pieces that connect us.
i1Sh-She's crying!
Huh? Why am I crying?
Was it some kind of scary dream?
i1Maybe it would only help a little bit, but wouldn't she feel more comfortable living up here?
No! What am I-?! It's not like that!
If you're going to keep sleepwalking here anyway, why don't you just move in?
Are you sure?
Seriously! I! Love! You!
Call it trading spaces or whatever you want...
What?
Fooled you.
i1They're all completely exposed.
i1She's been cooking fish in my kitchen a lot lately, too.
i1Which means...
This is just a... coincidence!
What idiot let Sister get in the batter's box?
The Amazon, our Mother Jungle, lies before you!
Nino...
You look like a caIf being sent to market.
Ohh, and just who do you think might buy her?
That green thing... could it be?
i1Oh, that's a relief.
i1Someone's actually running a proper marathon.
Someone's running the wrong way!
No way! No one?
Don't force yourself, kiddo!
You sure you're okay?
i1Did he give up already?!
i1I need to cool off.
It's you when you run.
Swallow your necktie and choke on it, pansy-ass!
i1If I have only a light injury, two more in my platoon must be seriously hurt!
That's amazing! Here comes the final push.
Rec.
In first is Whitey! Rec's the runner-up, and Hoshi comes in third!
Oh, look at you two.
Huh? Treasure?
Legendary treasure?
This is the god of the Amazon!
i1Saying that out loud is really depressing...
That's it? You're just gonna take off like that?!
Yup, that's it. Sorry for taking up your time.
I was like, born and raised in Saitama. I'm totally friends with everyone in Saitama!
S-Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
Are they ever gonna make a cucumber-flavored one?
Please, calm down!
I never expected that man to uncover a winning Garigari stick...
A person?!
I see. So he was wasting away on top of the railing.
I remember... last night...
What are you talking about?
I miscalculated my ability to climb down, but I went up there by my own will.
Just stop. You two stay out of this for now.
i1It's an eye for an eye!
I am the Venusian!
i1I'll ignore everyone else's troubling reactions for now.
The girl that leaps to impossible heights in her sleep!
Yeah, yeah.
i1I can do this...
However... her powers far surpass my own.
Just leave!
Who said you're alone?
Hey Nino, you wanna tell him a little about Venus?
H-Hey! You guys are kidding, right?
Leaving already?
Come on, that was no peashooter! Those were real freaking bullets!
i1But she just kept sleepwalking back to her old place.
Wait... what am I doing?!
I can't listen!
i1But maybe this is for the best...
i1S-Still, Nino's not the type of person who gets really upset.
You're right!
She'll never get lonely now!!!
I meant to give you this one.
i1I'll trust her, just one more time.
Meow meow meow meow!
You're right!
What you find in that box might be a lot heavier than you think.
We'll be waiting.
Um, I figured I should think about it just a bit more...
I don't disagree with you.
Nino doesn't even wanna look at you!
Poor Nino! Those awful, callous men did such terrible things to you!
You're like the Golden Corn Fairy...
Hmm, that's true. Men have to be strong, right?
Wow! You're like one of those Chinese lion mothers. That's so cool!
Um...
Nobody wants to hear these kinds of confessions!
N-Nino!
Hoshi, look!
Are you sure that's a life line?!
How presumptuous! How dare she get so close to Maire?
i1Piceaux's classmate and destructive delinquent, Starlin.
I can't believe I let myself fall for you.
I dunno why...
Master Ko! The camera is locked and ready to roll!
i1Fine, screw it...
i1Wow! I had no idea she could make such a serious face.
But seeing your bare legs is making me feel ill.
The only man I love is Maire! Don't you see, Starlin?!
I'm not trying to rush to my death. The god of punk rock is just pushing me in that direction.
Wait! My love transcends yours!
Then shall we settle this by force?
i1Indeed, beauty is a sin.
i1My love belongs only to one man. And his name is...
What? Nino, no...
So you can go in there then, right?
I've got berries of steel!
There's no such thing as ghosts.
Which means...
i1Her solid weight is...
I think I've just had my fill of this whole thing.
Haunted houses are only fun when they make you scream.
Those aren't sunglasses you put on Rec!
i1That scream echoed all across the riverbank.
i1The wind blows.
You wanna live here?
Yes.
I'm completely opposed!
There are special requirements
Welcome, my friend...
And this is for you, Mr. Rec. An extended work modeled after you!
It's a sweeping epic work that takes eight volumes just to get you your first job.
i1I feel sorry for his entire kind.
I practiced!
What kind of ending is that?!
Back there, I only got to draw what other people wanted me to.
Hey, Maestro!
I called the editing department, as any good upstanding citizen would.
i1And so...
I wrote this anniversary song just for you!
What I heard was...
Look, she seems so calm.
I'm no so pitiful that I'd fly back to my old flame just because my nest is a little lonely!
I thought you were gonna celebrate with Billy today.
Seriously! Big Bro is one legendary bird!
Th-The boss's woman?!
Don't tell me the boss's woman was
Big Bro!
I'm sure you're pretty weirded out right now, but you know someone exactly like him, right?
Imitating my lover's cry.
I never said anything like that!
What is this?
The most important part got taped over with some weird song.
Hey, Nino!
Chief.
With that in mind, I'd like to go over the company's current direction.
As you can see on the graph in front of you,
manufacturing a new line of shoes and school slippers.
What are you doing, Nino?!
i1Nino never does anything for no reason.
i1So there must be some reason she's acting this way.
I got a message from my parents.
The message just reached his brain.
I missed my chance last time, but now I'd like to talk to you about those tapes.
I feel like bawling my heart ou Where'd she go?
I'll kill you.
It'll be okay... I'm sure he was just bluffing.
There's no way someone would kill me over this...
Don't let go of your pride.
Maria came up with this trap to destroy a person's will to live.
Let me see you to the edge of the riverbank.
I will.
i1Guys like him are usually just mindless workaholics who can only...
I have to leave the riverbank.
Nino!
Recruit!
You want me to meet your parents?
You might never be able to return. Make sure you think about this carefully.
Look! He has a torso!
i1Is this what they call being engaged?
I think it's about a size 7...
I did it!
Uh, Nino?
Ahh, Nino. Are you really that happy about this?
You've thought this over quite a lot, haven't you?
But to think that she's returning to Venus...
Nino...
No, listen... that's not why I'm looking at you like this.
I'm coming... right now.
I should bring a spare tank next time.
Here comes a riddle!
Oh! Oh! I know!
No, no, no, no, no.
Of course, I had no idea at the time you were going to drag me into it.
Hm? What is it, P-ko?
But for now, you're cute just the way you are.
What are these two shadows?!
You got a problem with my skeleton?
Me! Me, me, me!
Huh? Hoshi needs a retest, too?
Are you okay, Hoshi?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Then you'd get disqualified in one!
will be supplied by the church.
You think so?
Sorry, everyone. But I'll just die if I get more than a few feet away from Billy.
And now it's day number six...
Is that...
At least you're not rotten to the core!
Too cramped! Too close!
i1Do I really gotta be this close to his ugly mug?
Chief? What about the test?
No! Then you won't be able to go to Venus!
Shut up!
Big Bro!
i1Huh... so P-ko came up with most of the topics, it looks like.
I was worried since Rec and Hoshi are always fighting with each other.
Cut the chitchat
Awesome! Did his headache go away after that?!
but my lover Nino-san
You spend a night with someone as amazingly cute as Nino,
Come forth!
Now then, Recruit-kun,
Give it up, Rec!
I think itd turn black even if it had been white.
Now that I think about it, we havent.
Even though she stays the night?
Even though you said youve not had a date,
This isnt nearly enough!
Die, you bast
Yeah.
Endure it.
Aw gee, you still have a long way to go.
Hey, where are you going, Hoshi?!
Such an unrealistic number?
This is Kou! All females in the school, please gather in the gym!
What were those who didnt leave their names with the chocolates trying to do?
The white rose that blooms in my heart
Whats a date?
but nothing will change unless I rid her of her doubts.
Rainbow Bridge will be sectioned off just for our drive.
I plan to entrust Japan to Ichinomiya-kun.
Dinner in town with the Prime Minister.
Therell be a first-rate orchestra,
A hundred different expressions of star-heads frustrations.
youre actually going home after getting me this worked up?!
Oh, and Im a Venusian.
When does Nino-san bring up the topic of Venus?
Isnt there a pattern in that ignorance?
Please keep it within the atmosphere.
Estuary?
Whether this river really connects to the sea,
Yes.
Nino-san, maybe you should hold
I just got a little curious about Nino-sans past.
Its long-awaited, after all.
It sure is.
Perry.
I cant stand the smell of boats.
If I return, seppuku is all thats left for me.
Oh, but compared with my mothers home-cooked meals, the food here tastes better.
Hoshi will sing!
And that's the solution.
i1I sincerely respect that one guy out of five with the balls to not turn and look at you...
Amazon, is that you again?
Amazon... Amazon...
I'm trying to tell Amazon...
That your cell... I mean your...
i1What's going on?!
I see... You've been through a lot.
That stuff you're wearing right now.
If I wear anything heavier than this, my body'll be crushed under the weight!
He always looks like that.
We were laughing about it earlier. It's just like, too funny!
Sorry. Well, talk to you later!
You're sooo totally funny!
It's too bad.
If you've had all you can take, it's not good to hold it in like this!
Cool. I'll be waiting.
Hold on! She only shoplifted to get attention!
Seven o'clock.
Nino!
Cow... sit...
That's why I can't be with you anymore.
No, you don't.
I'd have to hit you at least a hundred more times!
i1to force Hoshi into a Beaver Fever flashback.
So it's your fault he's like this!
Hey, his dreams are taking kind of a weird turn...
Teacher...
Amazon! I'm sorry! I know I said I'd be with you forever...
Why? Umm...
Chief! We wanna be able to shoot that kappa thing, too!
i1Sweet cake and sweet tea.
Sister! Stella! What's going on?
It was just a deliveryman. That's all.
Shirai Toru?
If you don't come home to us, how can I consider you a husband anymore?
It just means there's only one path left to us.
What is the future outlook of the sport?
I hope we can always continue to walk alongside one another.
i1All this time, I thought you were trying so hard to keep your wife from turning into a chicken!
I needed a copy of my residential information to apply for the competition.
Tranquility and passion as one.
If you are a true man, your heart desires only green tea and rakugan.
We just have to brush it all aside with grace.
Y-You're right. We have to be better tea ceremony masters than they could ever be!
This is indeed the tea whisk topknot that Lord Nobunaga himself used
This is insane! You'd call for the manager if even a single strand of hair was
i1It's so beautiful! What's he doing?!
Perhaps it was a mistake to invite you two along.
i1I can't leave after coming this far...
Well... I still have a long way to go compared to you.
This one!
Don't you want to know more about the Chief?
i1This is the world of wabi-sabi that the Chief loves so much!
How many times do I have to do this?
There isn't much oxygen on Venus, and it also has toxic levels of carbon dioxide.
Sorry. I can't.
Will we all fit?
All dead weight will be left behind on Earth!
bord0blur0.5See you off to Venus!
bord0blur0.5I must let my dear young Ko be free and take his trip!
Just leave it to me! I'll teach you all about my amazing strawberry diet!
I'm an aesthetician!
come knock on the door of my salon, "Queen's Bee"!
You mean you can make my already perfectly-toned body even more beautiful?!
For example, even a single week of the "Boot Camp" program can totally change your body.
Really?! I wanna give those a try!
I know how strenuous your diet is, so I came to check up on you.
It turns out I sweat a lot more than others.
Sister!
They say a human soul weighs point-two grams, so if I just get rid of that
i1Those two bounced back and now they're even lazier than ever.
Hey, Tetsuro! Class is currently in session.
Tetsuo's asleep, too. Aren't you gonna wake him up?
Tetsuo didn't stop his training, even after boot camp ended.
He keeps talking to those pecs...
Oh yeah? I like him even more now.
What's wrong? Are you upset someone touched you?
Stella... around here, the boss is whoever's strongest.
My genes belong to Sister!
Nice! I did that when I was young!
Tetsuo, don't! If your neck gets any thicker, your iron mask won't last!
Hold on!
I've had my suspicions ever since boot camp ended...
i1Your deltoids, teres major, and your abs! They're all your precious friends!
I'm sorry, but... it seems like they're communicating solely through posing.
Just look at them! If they fight in this state
Not yet! If Tetsuro really is an apostle of the Holy Muscle, no blood will be shed here.
No! This is...
My muscles are fleeing into Tetsuo's body!
Massage with love!
You look cute.
O-Okay!
i1I'm at a disadvantage since I'm more of the cute type.
All right, everyone. It's time for the main event!
Follow my lead and let's all do the Arakawa Spirit Dance!
Huh? Where'd those lanterns come from?
I think you're even stupider for giving up so easily.
i1The festival has come to an end...
No!
Why would you make a Hoshi-shaped lunch for me
It's just leftovers!
Wow. Your feelings weigh heavily on my shoulders...
Oh, this embroidery...
What are you trying to prove here?!
Why do you hate Hoshi so much?!
Yeah, you're acting kind of weird, Amazon.
So why are you pretending to like Rec?
So you're still cute. I think Hoshi would understand.
Don't gaze at a bare maiden like that!
Bye!
Behind those sunglasses, his eyes were so very pure.
We gotta simulate how the girls are gonna act!
Miracle Beaver!
Oh, sorry! Are you okay, Sammie?!
All that remains is to wait for the girls.
No, I'll do it!
Hey, are you okay? Grab on!
T-Tengu!
So you're behind this place!
Hoshi...
Yeah. So dry those tears.
Yeah, of course. Every single day.
i1And so, the two of them drenched the soil of Saitama with their tears.
And to make a celestial body come to you...
and came up with this!
Yeah!
Just one, huh? Man, I can't choose!
i1They seem to be thinking of it more like a wish than an order.
i1They almost look like joyful little kids.
i1A battle royale...
i1Their brotherly bond fell apart like jelly.
What do you mean?
Show me your soul as a true rock star!
Just do it!
You got a problem with birds?!
He's still on the white line!
But I have my ambition!
I think she's starting to despair over her love for the Chief.
Why?
It'd leave a real sour taste in my mouth if we pushed her off now while she was still crying.
I'm so hungry.
A balloon battle?
You're also done if you go out of bounds.
to make Maria my mother! And I'll fight to the death to make it happen!
So I've decided to assist you with everything I've got!
Here's your hoe, P-ko.
Snacks don't count as weapons!
Excellent. The two most likely winners are now locked in battle.
i1Then what's the Chief's ambition?
i1Am I ready to destroy the dreams of my love just so I can force him to love me back?
I can't...
I'm sorry, Chief. I guess you know by now...
i1Right here in public?! I'm not ready for this!
I love you, Chief...
I didn't take a single hit in the fight so far.
Sister!
Sure. Leave it to me!
It begins now!
What are you saying, Hoshi?
You still rely too much on firepower.
He'll never win the fight like this!
Is his fear making him hallucinate?
It might be the real thing!
That's what I've always wanted someone to say to him, but now's not the time!
I am a servant of God. His voice is absolute.
God never gives such specific advice!
We're counting on you, Sister!
Is that even possible?
Yeah, you can do it!
i1Witness the birth of a new empress.
Can we really allow this order?!
Oh, well I don't mind going along with your interpretation.
But remember how that cold snap came through?
Wow, Maria! You really take care of everyone in your territory!
I didn't know clothes were made from hair.
A golden tummy warmer!
I'll make one for you special later.
That's how I see it, anyway.
But I have another job for the men.
Dogs?
Now pick the collar you like, and get down on your knees.
Take a look at your betters over there and learn from them.
Don't just stand there!
I know how slippery the rock is over there.
Let's always be together. Right now, and forever after!
i1I know it's just a magic trick.
i1The trick that shed those tears.
i1all I could do was give you my deafening applause.
Wait!

If you keep this up, I'll have to-
Maybe it would only help a little bit, but wouldn't she feel more comfortable living up here?
If you're going to keep sleepwalking here anyway, why don't you just move in?
No problem.
Now we can become even closer...
Man, I haven't been here in a while.
Seriously! I! Love! You!
Huh?
We're trading spaces right now.
Call it trading spaces or whatever you want...
Well... yeah. But I'm not sure how long this will last.
Good... good...
Very convenient.
Chapter 111: "Venusian"
This is just a... coincidence!
So the coach decided to sacrifice everything, all in the name of victory?
It's the one keepsake I got in exchange for giving up on my dream of being in the big leagues...
The Amazon, our Mother Jungle, lies before you!
I'm the Hypersonic Amphibious Kappa!
So what you're saying is, you're a masochist.
Who hasn't placed their bet yet? Step right up!
Well now I'll feel awful if he doesn't win!
That's the end of Whitey!
It seems like this race is a really big deal.
Of course, you're such a scrawny little pansy-ass, I doubt you'll even finish the race!
Hmm...
You're the kind of guy people applaud just for finishing the race!
I told you, I can do anything!
Not bad!
She's right. But I can't fail now!
If I can't take first, what's the point?!
The heart of mankind... is like that cloud right there.
Rec, Hoshi... look.
I'm invincible forever!
Is that you?!
It's Rec and Hoshi.
This is... the power of the human spirit...
And look at your knees shake.
Nino, wai-

Could it possibly be an OOP Art, or something like that?
There's no point in hiding it. We can see right through your lies!
Excuse me, Amazon-
Huh? Who's the Amazon?
Watch and learn!
John Lennon
All right, let's get back to the game, shall we?
Chewing on a twig helps.
There's no mistake. I've found it at long last... the Venusian headquarters!
What?!
That explains the weird clothes he's wearing...
They must have forced him to put that costume on.
Y-You're!
A kappa, and a star.
A flower?
Oh, if that's how you meant it, then sure-
It seems I'm right.
Ha-ha. Ha-ha. Foolish humans.
Are you even listening to me?!
Little did you know, we manipulated you into producing Venusian weapons for us!
He totally fell for it!
Just leave!
But I... I just can't do it alone!
What's going on?
So, you finally decided to show yourself, Venusian!

Venus.
Yeah... that's absolutely right.
It seemed just like any other department store. I was devastated.
You... that's...
I couldn't help it!
Man, she looks really pissed.
How can I even talk to her if she doesn't come down?
It looks like a powerful hunter.
She's right. Another girl would understand how Nino's feeling way better than I do.
Th-Thank you.
That's enough! It was stupid of me to trust you in the first place!
The human heart is both heavy and fragile.
The moment he said that, the box I held in my arms began to feel much heavier.
- I want to know... - To our darling Venusian princess...
But you ruined her tapes, too?!
This is the time to be a little forceful, like...
Wait!
The referee has already declared you the winner, my sweet yokozuna.
You've got something seeping out of you, P-ko.
Hmm, that's true. Men have to be strong, right?
I guess you have as much grit as a lion cub, at least.
But I want to at least try to atone for what happened.
Collect yourself and kneel down right here in front of us.
You don't understand.
So these personal defects are like nothing to me.
I knew I'd told her I would always be by her side.

Come on, Rec!
See you later, Rec.
Oh, Rec.
Okay, then. Here, climb on.
And she seems to be getting even heavier...
AHHHHHH! What is this?!
Don't do it, Whitey! Let's think this through!
The chair gives me all the length I need.
Just forget it...
Finally revealed-can you withstand it?! A living kappa-it's so scary! Sure, this place might be surprising. But there's no real horror element to it.
A kappa? Which means the Chief must be up ahead.

Oh, is that how it works?
And I'll make some horrifying sounds all around him.

Chapter 136: "Arakawa Party Skit Finals"
Hey, Billy... why did you turn down that role in P-ko's movie?
The view along the banks of the Arakawa changes as you draw closer to the sea.
An absent-minded old man fishing for crayfish.
Its unusual to see that bird around here.
Id been so relieved that I managed to ask her out on a date that Id lost focus.
Oh, so thats what it is.
The most important thing in love is
That is the most important relationship between a man and a woman!
So, Im sure we shouldnt stand this close.
And Nino-san, move a little to the right.
In the end, our current situation is no different than before.
Thats right.
Okay, Nino-san. Im standing up!
I wondered if youre used to wearing dresses like that.
Whats the matter?
It couldnt reach the sea.
Rec!
It could go all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Shall we go too?
Sachiels stance!
Yes! Well do it!
Theres a pressure to speak up now, even though I know its babysitting
Anythings fine.
Ive never played with a girl,
compete in a one-on-one battle.
Yes!
Frail?
Stellas special move.
That is it.
Come, Stella.
I played battle with my big brother.
Well done, Rec. You lost to her on purpose.
On purpose?
but, certainly, I didnt get serious with her.
but obedient kids are quite
She must be a nice girl after all.
Hi there, Stella. Today
Sorry, but would you come with me on an errand?
Can I lift something that Sister cant?
What is the government doing about this?!
The milk here is delicious.
Im sorry, Rec-kun.
I really dont like this person
Sure, I have some.
but even Sister would be annoyed if he were blasted by that wicked mouth.
Cross-dresser.
Voodoo.
Sorry.
I dont really want it.
Now you see her, now you don't.
Hora kitto muchuu da Everyone is in a haze.
Nino, what are you-
Too bright...
It's you! Arakawa resident candidate and total sci-fi nerd!
The Maestro is truly a sight to behold...
This is P-ko in "Sprout de Mon Amour."
And this is for you, Mr. Rec. An extended work modeled after you!
It's a sweeping epic work that takes eight volumes just to get you your first job.
Everyone down here has some kind of secret, but his involves his actual past creations.
The Chief said he wanted to see more of the comic.
I see. You catch it, push it right up to the brink, and then toss it back.
Well, Maestro? Finished yet?
Rejected Without being hired by a single company?
I will defeat you, here on the Galaxy Bridge!
I don't get Potechi.
When the passions of people collide-
Thank you!
Oh, that's not true.
That scene where the Baby Sardine Kingdom suffered a coup had me on the edge of my seat.
Nino... that never really happened.
An anniversary? What could it be?! Is it the day they first met? Or their first kiss?!
They're probably gonna meet here.
I'd be so nervous right now if I were in her shoes!
Chapter 142: "A Love that Transcends Species"
The Kokucho Crew? Like that gang? Is the boss a bird, too?!
He's higher than any of the upper officers in both strength and avian popularity!
I'll use that sting to kill the national bird.
Oh, you're talking about that thing they do at pet stores.
Big Bro! How could you give up the sky-?
Big Bro!

No, I think it's more like this.
- Next time, on 6 BRIDGE x2- - Kaboboom!
Hello?
I thought I asked you to investigate my son's girlfriend.
How'd you get in here?
I care deeply about that girl in the picture.
What was that just now?
Hora minna muchuuda Everyone's immersed within it.
Hora sotto te wo totte Come on, stand and take my hand now.
Hora kitto muchuu da Everyone is in a haze.
Chief.
Nino... it won't be long now.
I'll endure it!
I got a message from my parents.
Your parents?!
Takai, Shimazaki-do you mind if we end the meeting a little early?
There's no way someone would kill me over this...
I see.
Why is my heart fluttering like this?!
He's cute, but that's all!
I have to stand my ground on this one!
To be honest... I kind of... lied to you about something.
Is that it? I don't care about that.
I just don't know where to go from here.
I have to leave the riverbank.
When I asked you to be my lover, I knew I'd have to abandon you someday.
You're the only one who can stop Nino from crying!
Recruit!
Nino's really serious about this.
There's bound to be some cultural differences.
No, I can do it!
I'll...
I think it's about a size 7...
What's that? A rocket classification? You wanna know more before we leave?
You snooze, you lose!
Of course, Nino.
Oh, really?
A Venusian vacation?
My romantic getaway is turning into some community field trip!
You again?!
But I'm just glad that's all there was to Nino's secret.
Nino's telling us about Venus!
I'm coming... right now.
An hour's worth of oxygen wasn't nearly enough.

Chapter 153: "Terminal Hostility"
Are you okay, Rec?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's not going to get any worse.
Check out this fever!
You know, they say that slightly unhealthy people tend to live even longer!
This is goodbye. For real.
Then you'd drop out in 0.01 seconds!
Day 2
Day 4
It's so nice! Can I touch it?
Ahh! I'm so sorry! I know I'm supposed to be nice to girls! But...
Hey, P-ko! Can I ask you a tiny little favor?
The girls are always disgustingly friendly with each other, but they still dropped out...
I hate to admit it, but it's probably best if I let the Chief take the lead here.
Chief? W hat about the test?
It's fine. I instinctively go into hibernation when I go underground.
No! Then you won't be able to go to Venus!

I told you she was real! And there are those crazy Tengu, too!
Huh? Um, well... I guess I am, in a certain way.
Oh...
Stop! I won't let you hurt Nino!
You gotta be kidding!
I have Nino! And even if I didn't... you know...
That your cell... I mean your...
Your skirt... don't you think it's a bit too short?
And it's obvious she's just pretending to be sickly to get his attention!
You've been hurt so much before today. But you're safe now.
She's as delicate as a feather in the wind. We can't let her blow away!
If you're really so frail, why don't you wear some warmer clothes?!
- He always looks like that. - Nino!
Oh, sorry Nino...
One of my students made a lunch for me today.
Teacher! You better hurry up and eat before it melts!
Nino! You already cooked it!
You're happy, right? I get it!
All right! A date with Nino!
Hold on! She only shoplifted to get attention!
I'm coming for her right now!
That's why I can't be with you anymore.
I don't mind. Standing and accepting it is the least I can do!
Now let's see just how deep your feelings run! I challenge you to a duel!
Well I love him thiiiiiis much!
Man... what does Nino see in this idiot, anyway?
N-Nino...
Huh? I thought you were with that other girl now.
Amazon... Amazon... frail and cute Amazon... Amazon...
My ex's name was Nino, and she was pretty popular herself.
It's this tall!
Wh-Whatever! You just have too much endurance.
Chapter 162: "Song of Love, Echo!"
Help us sing the hypnosis song!
So help us-
Help you?
It's kind of lonely with just the two of us.
Now it's way more lively here. Or at least, it should be...
Come on! Let's do it.
What are you talking about?
Now what are we supposed to do? You blew our floating stand all to hell!
Why? Umm...
He never lets the sweets run low.
Chapter 164: "Encounter with Ignorance"
Get back here!
What was that?!
O-Oh, really?
Well, she's still doing her job as well as ever,
and it's not like the two of them are doing anything inappropriate.
You have the talent to lay down white lines all across the world!
Coach, I...
I said hold on, Shimazaki!
What is it? Now you hesitate?
Shimazaki really has a thing for him, but she has no idea he's already married.
I'd better go and practice my flamingo!
I've been expecting this.
That was the only thing about you I actually respected!
She even wrote you a letter!
I needed a copy of my residential information to apply for the competition.
Today's dessert is "gelato drowning in espresso."
Sure. I jet his, you jet hat.

They're total snobs!
Maybe if I compliment his tea tools...
Ah, how lovely. Your...
This is indeed the tea whisk topknot that Lord Nobunaga himself used-
Very good.
Oops!
That was the perfect wabi-length pause!
What a waste...
I'm so jealous.
It's time I tested you.
So... what do you think of this pebble?
Uh... this big one with the grasshopper stuck on it!
Yeah. It's good to understand the hobbies and tastes of the person you love.
Y-You're right!

You're right! Let's all start our diets today!
Anyone have any ideas?
Hey! Are you sure that's really gonna work?
I'm an aesthetician!
Okay! I'm gonna shove that goddess outta my way and really shine!
And I have some exercises that are even more effective.
Diet in Progress
I'm used to eating less because of Sister's training, but this is just-
I might not look it, but I did get thinner!
Jacqueline said to assume someone's always looking, which is why I'm wearing this mini-tee.
Next, Sister's team. Um... where are they?
Maybe they've all been put out of commission for real.
I'll go look-
You two will probably never get those masks off now!
Sorry...
They say a human soul weighs point-two grams, so if I just get rid of that-
I just can't handle being alone.
'Twas indeed quite a pain.
Well... hmm...
Muscles.
Ah, I guess we should excuse ourselves, then.
You losers of muscle!
Is that how you talk to your boss?
My genes belong to Sister!
This is bad. They're both really serious about this. There might be blood...
Dammit! Isn't there anything we can do?!
Not with this sexy body of mine...
Tetsuo, don't! If your neck gets any thicker, your iron mask won't last!
Fine, then...
If you believe in them, muscles will respond in kind!
Can't you give me more power, my biceps?!
- Oh no! I'm so embarrassed! - Tetsuo, you're wrong!
No! Muscles are like lion cubs! They only grow stronger by being cast down into the valley!
You're wrong!
Your deltoids, teres major, and your abs! They're all your precious friends!
Traitors! You've betrayed me!

Now what, Nino? Victory is mine if you don't fight back!
I'll start with this red one.
I haven't lost yet.
I've had enough! I give up...
Well, before you give up, at least watch me go super hit on her.
You're the second man King Garigari has deemed worthy!
This is my right as her lover.
Nino, would you like to go somewhere el-
Hey, Amazon! Rec's right over here!

You wanted me to eat something like that?
Even so, it's just too much!

YOU'RE unbelievable!
Hey, look! A new beach house is opening up!
The beach, huh? I don't get out there that often.
The ocean is calling me.
So, three hours later...
Hey! Stop trying to get the jump on us!
Reccie! Did you do that to get Sister's attention?
A girl's drowning!
Alas! I had better go rescue her!
Hey, are you okay? Grab on!

They all look like they're having fun with it.
A battle royale...
A temporary truce until we're the last ones left standing!
Aren't you two in the same boat?
Only one of us can win, you know.
- We're different! - Yeah!
You wanna take care of that guy while we're still a team?
Yeah. He looks like he'll be the most trouble.
I know we have to push him off the raft to win, but...
H-Hey, Billy! If you knock him off that white line of his...
I don't think it'll be an unrequited love forever.
Whatever! You're just saying that.
How embarrassing!
Congratulations, P-ko.
The Sleeping Beauty Tyrant, Nino!
Oh, there's one other rule to make this a peaceful, fair match.
Chapter 186: "Bloodsport"
Calm down, P-ko! You can still forfeit right now if you want to!
Oh, but maybe I should use the smaller one for better mobility.
Let me make this clear, Stella. I won't be going easy on you.
Actually, I've been thinking about entrusting the future to the next generation.
So I've decided to assist you with everything I've got!
The balance of power is gonna get really messed up if Sister and Stella team up.
While Sister's balloon is too high for anyone to reach!
You're wide open, Nino!
No! Look!
Sister, no! You only get one weapon per person!
I could beat you as is, but I need to save my strength for the very end.
I'll show you my yokai magic, far more powerful than any sword.
But I know for a fact I cut something! Why did I not hear his balloon pop?
And so, I claim victory...
Chief! You're so b-beautiful!
Am I ready to destroy the dreams of my love just so I can force him to love me back?
P-ko!
I love you, Chief...
Well, crap. It looks like Sister and Maria have earned their spots in the final showdown.
Did I hear you say "crap"? What's that supposed to mean?
There's gonna be big problems if she wins...

But!
Yeah, you can do it!
You two are the greatest! Maria! Sister!
I don't care who wins anymore!
I was just kindly putting Sister in his place.
That order is absolute.
"Turn the water of the Arakawa River to blood!"
You think I'm some kind of monster?
We never thought of her as some evil mastermind.
Verily!
B-But if I do that, I won't be able to move very fast, and...
Starboard! I'm not sensing enough despair!
You're really sad.
That's not even it!
Do you remember when I went out like this to unsnag that grass boat?
She's crying!?
I wasn't trying to make you cry!
It's probably the most I can do for her right now.
It kinda looks like the face Star's always making.
If you're fine with it,

Okay, Ric, I'm coming in!
That must be why she sleeps in the drawers even though it's such an impressive

Im counting on you.
First cake ingredients and now vegetable provisions, huh?
No!
All the vegetables under the bridge are provided by P-ko.
All of them?
Well then, Ive no choice.
Since Nino chose you,
Heres a symbol of our meeting.
Kinda feels like youre being deceived, doesnt it?
How awful.
How dare you say such awful things in front of the bell peppers?!
Even the bell peppers arent bitter because they wanted to be!
Well, hey, a small sliver tastes great on a hamburger!
Shes a devastating bungler!
I seldom see such big tomatoes.
Thats right.
Each and every one is, no matter what kind...
Whats she staring at?
Id only learn of the reason
Arent you glad, Stella?
but since Sister gave Stella her name,
Theres even a cucumber corner.
The main dish today is the fish I caught.
This is really delicious.
You dont even accept my cookies during Mass.
Nino-sans my lover, though. I cant possibly refuse her love.
Come to think of it, do you have a job, Rec?
What should I do?

And you call yourself Amazonesses? Those guys in tengu masks are guys!
I've gotta keep looking for that ball.
Ball? Don't play dumb.
I'll show you just this once.
We'd really prefer a photo ID...
Yeah, that's good.
You're the ones who popped up and started interrogating me!
And doesn't this makeup make me look like Avril? really not sure where the author's obsession with her comes from
So why did you go and surround me!?
'Cuz you're lame?
This guy really ticks me off.
These things you call "treasures"
So, what are you gonna do, schoolgi
No...
Oh well, at least it looks like you found the ball.
Oh, boss?
This early-morning breeze is just great.
You're!
They're going straight over each other's heads, but the feeling is definitely the same.
I know perfectly well that you're aliens! Come along
This is terrible!
Foolish Earthlings, laugh while you still can.
Come on, snot bubble, don't be so loud!
That's right. The girl you saw is one of my comrades.
Foolish earthlings!
Such fearsome aliens...
He believed the whole thing!
To protect our blue and pure world!
Even if I must sacrifice my life...
Nino...
Yeah. Deadly serious.
This smell reminds me of the first time we met...
T'was wonderful!
You shouldn't just blow it off as a waste of time!
Huh?
A metal case and a tape deck?
And
What? Who cares about that?
But Nino's usually pretty hard to annoy. If I just apologize, she'll understand.
Did she just use a bird to take them!?
What are you talking about? Are you just gonna leave Nino alone like this?
She'll get lonely, and
Maria?
Nyanyanyanyan! We're waiting for mew to come home, myaster!
It might weigh down your heart far more than that box weighs down your body.
It's not as simple as just saying you'll accept anything. can't change this line, or else the next line becomes clunk
Leech, leech leech leech leech!
Poor Nino, what did that insensitive man do to you!?
All right, tonight we girls are going to talk it all out!
Really? That sounds fun!
Anyway,uh, whoops. Let's skip to the next one.
The baton was far harder to get off my fingers than I'd expected, and I had to run the whole course alongside the others.
And then there's the first time I went to karaoke in high school...
No way. Nino doesn't have anything to say to you.
I feel like I'll lose you if I do...
I had nothing to say to such an unexpected response.
But those words hadn't really gotten through to Nino.
I'm more curious what you're going to do!
I'm making a pun.
Give me your right hand.
I see you wrapped in your red coat,
Deep in the French countryside, the girl Pico's love is laid out in beautiful imagery.
How presumptuous! Doing that with Maes...
If it's like that, I just -have- to man the camera!
I understand your love so well it hurts!
Just read it! It'll suck you right in!
Don't get me wrong, I'm not fighting for you.
Secretly, he loves

Sure, director!
A scene where Ninophy, her fiance being stolen away by Pico, challenges her to a duel...
The white glove!?
What, we're going with that!?
What's wrong? You look sad.
Wait, you were serious!?
What is this, a homage to Yakushimaru?
Stalin, you're so insensitive!
I can't.
Choshu and Satsuma must ally for the sake of a new Japan! need more ls. i liked writing senba.

All right, that's a wrap.
We just had so much good material that something had to get cut.
I love you,
Not good enough!
Wow, you scared me.
No thanks, I'm fine.
Thanks...
I don't wanna look scared...
Here goes!
You'd better watch your back.
I'm a kappa. I'm a creature of instinct.
What!? There's something on my face!
This doesn't do any good at all!
Wow, he winked.
I take a deep breath so I won't have to stop
Pain? No thank you days, sadness? No thank you days
I'm completely opposed!
He recognized him as a master!
Wow, this kappa is so cool!
What, you made one about me?
Man, he sure put a lot of effort into ticking me off.
I guess his is what he's drawn?
I don't have one.
Really?
I didn't even come up with the name, my first manager did!
You're sure treating him like a famous author.
Nino, you can draw manga?
What are you talking about? Is this really what you want to draw?
Wrong! I'm not Potato-chip anymore!
Yeah!
And...
Dammit! Our psychic powers won't work anymore!
Great job!
I don't get what Potato-chip's up to.

That guy has no common sense!
Then... what is common sense?
Mixed martial arts.
You want to be a bride?
I like...
No.
i1I talked back to him for the first time. And the last.
Of course I don't expect you to do it for free.
Hrm.
is Master Ko's charismatic ability to gather people from all walks of life under his banner.
Get your face right into the dirt!
I was just... showing them some of my surefire negotiation tactics!
Hey. Hold that mirror perfectly still, would you?
i1I can't cover up any more weirdness!
i1If Whitey starts talking about his lines and that damn White Cornish...
i1Ah, I feel like I'm right back in my old office.
So are we all finished here?
i1Just the people I didn't want to see today.
Maybe I should get a haircut. You know, for Hoshi.
You haven't been coming in to the main office lately, either!
Ah, that smells nice. Is it Earl Grey today?
What is it? Can you hold on a sec?
Ki
i1They're just playing house.
i1They can't possibly advance their relationship. In which case, it's not too late...
But we are!
Rec.
You're lucky, Takai.
Yes?
You are weak and flabby!
Takai? You're crying.
What is this, all of a sudden?
You were?
And now I get to see you smile all the time.
We should let him enjoy it.
I feel like I could fly!
HEEEELLP!!!
That's it for my presentation. We will continue with the covert observations.
Shimazaki!
A pickled radish?
Star
Wow, nice digs!
Um, I've been wondering...
Next time, on 9 BRIDGE!
Yay, this'll be perfect!
There are lots of people here I haven't met yet.
H-Hoshi!
Help me out!
This is it. I'll destroy her.
Downfall?!
Wha?
Stella! You've heard the way he talks about her, right?
I'm fully aware.
I don't like that word, "unrequited."
Big Sis!
After all, Maria's just a delicate, harmless woman
They were threatening to decapitate me!
Maybe you haven't noticed, but Stella is actually incredibly violent!
i1And I definitely can't wimp out in front of my girlfriend!
OH YEEAAAAAAHH!!!
Now's no time to worry about what she'd say!
I'm such a weakling. I should just...
You're not weak at all, Stella.
Oh, yeah. I see him in here a lot.
This is bad. He needs to get out of there ASAP!
You know what? I'm feeling good today. So I'm gonna tell you the story behind the mask.
Huh? What do you mean, "top of the charts"?
How could any of those ludicrous songs of yours ever get that popular?!
i1I'd play all the stuff my producer had rejected, or songs I'd written to let off steam.
I'm a pathetic satellite.
This stuff's a giant bag of crap compared to the music I play up there!
Sure thing!
It's Nino's turn this time, but she was fast asleep when I went to get her.
i1Its shape may not be perfect.
i1A blue sky stretches itself across the window.
i1Sunbathing in the summer breeze is incredibly pleasant.
'Kay!
Woo! I wanna be in front!
Yup. Grown men should be closest to the fire, right?
Yeeaaah!
Here we go!
Just go get in back!
I know I am!
Also...
He's worthless!
Have you seen the area downstream? With the tennis courts and such?
No, nothing nuclear.
he's offered to develop the area at a ridiculous discount.
i1But still... why do I find his words so comforting?
i1I knew it! He's no ordinary man!
Well... construction doesn't start for a while, but you should probably leave soon, anyway.
I'm sure you don't want the police to get involved.
More importantly, why is this happening all of a sudden?
i1Whitey's normally so calm and gentle, and even he's angry.
It's actually my father
There's one other person who never comes to Mass.
Jeez, what's with this place? How did this go unreported until now?
No, I mean... I'm here from the Ministry of Land, and
Everyone just be quiet, okay?
but I'm here with a request.
And... okay, c'mon!
I always make sure to rent at least three DVDs.
Oh crap, I just noticed that both discs of "Planet Octotea 2: You Got Severed" are disc 2!
i1Don't touch it! It'll eat your finger!
i1As provided by Nino and the narrator.
repeat of 1:21:21
Whatever you say.
Just teach me and I'll do it right!
Huh?
Really? I wanna see!
We'll have to ask her.
Oh, is that so?
I call it "Living with Dying."british english punctuation rules REEEEEE
Anyway, I have to go to the counter.lit. I have billing to take care of
Hey, have we ever even talked before?
You don't have any friends?
You should live however you want.
i1I thought we'd never have anything to do with each other again.
Man, that was heavy.
What?
Why did you sign up for this?
That's true for me and just as much for you.
Are you free after this?
Is that something to talk about when we're grilling meat?
is there no one in our class you're close to?
Have people actually told you that?
So I don't have any interest in others.
but you're still making me mad!
Nice weather today.
Look at this mess.
Hey!
This is your fault, not hers!
i1I had a lot of fun!
Oh no, there he is.
Apparently people saw you two together yesterday.
I see...
Want some gum?
Aight.
What's that supposed to mean?
Good morning!
Sure.
an8Let me copy your homework!
I'd rather not have everyone ridiculemake fun ofbanter about me again.
We're in a library.
Of course not.
You know, I...
But I guess you wouldn't know his name anyway.
He's overly persistent in ways.
Kyoko, you're here too?
Are you dating?
I didn't mean anything in particular.
You're gravely mistaken if you think there's a purpose to everything I say!
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
i1To get straight to the point: Are you free?
Good morning.
Come on, stop being so gloomy. You should be having fun on a trip like this.
I'd say this is more like a kidnapping than a trip.
Actually, I'm amazed your parents let you even go on this trip.
What about you? What excuse are you going with?
Why not?
It's my book, so I can do what I want with it.
We've made landfall!she uses a word usually used in the context of landing with a plane, or arriving at land with a boat
No, I'm sure of it!
That's true.
I don't think you're using that one right.
I'll remember that.
Hey.
You do that!
By the way, I'm butt naked right now!
Oh, right.
why don't we play truth or dare?
I'll ask you "truth or dare," so start off by replying "truth."
If you don't want to answer, you can choose dare.
So, what's your answer to my question?
That's the kind of girl you like?
Where would you rank me in our class?
but that's super embarrassing.
That caught me off guard.
Truth!
Is that it?
Besides, I was fully prepared to tell you my measurements."three sizes" - BWH measurements
Seriously...
Two more rounds.
Sure, I don't mind.
I'll lend you my hand. Come on, stand up.
You should drink some water.
What did you get?
Truth.
Your boyfriend?
I'll explain all of this to you one day.
Come home safe and buy me a souvenir.
I was just pretending to be a mover.
That jacket suits you.
Well, this is my stop.
Yeah.
i1was a word of warning from her guardian.
You think you can do that?
Don't get close to her with half-baked feelings.
but there's one single book I've liked since I was a kid.
betrays just how uninterested you are in books.
Even if you don't want a girlfriend, you should make friends at least.
But I'd call that a resounding success.
Stop...
Our relationship isn't what you think it is.
Everyone's talking about you!
Sakura?
Goodbye!
And that's why we're where we are now.
Just a little bit longer...
i1I shouldn't have been surprised.
They're saying that the reason for your absence is me stalking you.
Do you understand why things have gotten like that?
Because I'm with you a lot, right?
There's no one wanting to talk with a boring classmate.
There you go again...
Come on, don't ignore me.
What does...
What does living mean to you?
Having fun being with someone.
That's rather sudden.
Nope.
Kyoko!
Hey, you, don't try to run away!
I'm all better now that you're here!
Sakura, let me go!
I'll give you as much as you want later!
Are you taking me somewhere quiet so you can pull a murder-suicide?
Hey.
Of course I'm going to die.
That goes for both of us.
I just thought I'm very fortunate to have someone care so much about me.
Oh, it's starting!
i1but my fears were unfounded.
i1The day she was discharged came in no time at all.
See you.
No, I'm good.
Well, have fun. Both of you.
i1How mean!
i1A person like that.
an8i1but was confirmed dead soon after.
Here, take this.
In life,
Sakura-san truly did a lot for me.
that I kept my hopes up.
This is it, right?
Thank you so much.
i1He doesn't seem to have many friends, so he'll probably keep it to himself.
i1I'll make him understand the glory of offal before I die!
i1I was so embarrassed, and so relieved that he came, that tears came out.
i1I wish they'd get along...
There's more.
This book is yours now.
To be completely honest,
I told you this before,
But youyou, and no one else
you figured yourself out on your own and found your own allure.
I always thought I was just like any other of the hundreds of thousands of high school students out there,
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
i1So I came up with this.
i1I know you might not like the idea,
i1That my words had reached you.
i1We were always looking at each other.
i1Thank you.
I'm here. Now what do you want?
Get to the point.
This is her book.
but I'm sure you know she'd never make a joke that would hurt you.
I could have been with Sakura...
No matter how much Sakura loved, cared for, and needed you,
And...
i1Well,
I've taken a liking to it recently.
Let's go to Sakura's place already.
repeat of 1:21:21
i1I was absent.
Those are historical novels, and this shelf is for history books.
Here you go.
What?!
Were you listening to me?!
Normally you'd act more surprised or say something poetic like "the fairest flowers soonest fade" to cheer me up.lit. cheer me up with a "bijin hakumei" - the beautiful die young. there's maybe an equivalent expression that goes "the fairest flowers soonest fade", but basically all the hits I get for it are as a tl for "bijin hakumei" so ???
What a coincidence!
See you.
I haven't told anyone.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your short life in a library?
Oh, that's right.
I'm making a list of things I want to do before dying in this book,
Where is this coming from?
No, I just like offal.??? I have no idea how to phrase this. should this be plural? "offal meat"? is there a western equivalent of horumonyaki?probably should spend 0 brain cells on this
But that's apparently because there's been some nifty medical advancements in the last ten years or so.
and apparently there's a foreign religion where if someone else eats you, your soul will live on inside of them.
or even worse.
And others don't have any interest in me.
Huh?
I think you do idiotic things every now and then, but I'm not trying to treat you like one.
What's going on?
Hey! Say something!
Hey!
Hey! How'll it be?
Huh?
Welcome back.
an8i1Coming up is the weather.
Hey, so are you close to Yamauchi or what?
Want some gum?
Aight.
Well, lemme know if anything interesting happens.
Good morning.
an8Let me copy your homework!
Great at sports, and has both looks and smarts.
I'm telling you, it's not like that.
Wanting to keep your secret is part of it, you know. You should be thanking me.
You know, I...
I'll make you spit it out tomorrow, okay?
She's a nice girl, so try and get along with her.
My family overreacts to everything I say, and they're desperately trying to pretend everything's normal.
Hanging out with you
Also, a fleeting summer rendezvous.as in romantic, does that come across?i can preserve the french flavor with this
Nothing.No, nothing.you're fired
Go and throw this away.
Huh? Is that all the luggage you brought?
but a trip with a guy is probably a bridge too far.
Why not?
All right, fine.
That's got to be your imagination.
It's sad playing cards with just the two of us.
Also, no asking me to do perverted stuff.
I think that one girl is pretty.
Okay, next round, next round.
This is pretty nerve-racking!
What?
Are you okay?
I'm terribly sorry,
Sure, I don't mind.
All right!
Do you want water?
i1Sakura! Where the hell are you?!
You lied to your parents and said you were on a trip with me, right?!
Your boyfriend?
Don't play games with me.joke with mesay something to poke fun
Are you listening?
but there's one single book I've liked since I was a kid.
This is a hug.
The naughty part...
is coming up.
Just kidding!
But you can let go now...
You live around here?
Let me clue you in on something.
are you doing?
I hate you, Takahiro!
Goodbye!
That's not true.
It wasn't a coincidence.
you accepted my request.
i1I shouldn't have been surprised.
What did you tell that best friend of yours about your hospitalization?
It's because you won't engage with anyone.
You should stop that already.
Thanks.
If you're all alone, you can't tell that you exist.
I put some clothes here.
Okay, thanks.
You can see this place from the hospital!
It had to be today.
Hey.
That goes for both of us.
Very much.
I wanted to go and see fireworks.
That's why it had to be today.
Huh?
Well, it doesn't really matter.
See you.
i1If I asked her,
i1she'd say I chose to change.
i1I was just thinking about you.
i1The complete opposite of me.
i1acknowledged by others,
i1A person like that.
i1How can I become like you?
Yeah, you're right.
What's wrong?
i1I steeled my resolve,
I'm so, so glad,
i1He came across Living with Dying at the hospital and started reading it,
i1so I just gave in and told him about it.
i1He doesn't seem to have many friends, so he'll probably keep it to himself.
i1But when I tried talking to him today, he was really fun, and I liked him right away.
i1No, I won't lie here.
i1Not lying to them.
So, how's it going?unitalicize from here on--she is here
there were many times I thought I was in love with you.
Remember when I asked you to play truth or dare with me at the hospital?
Why won't you ever speak my name?
You're really an amazing person.
Your relationship with others is what forms you as a person.
you figured yourself out on your own and found your own allure.
i1So I came up with this.
i1I know you might not like the idea,
Ma'am.
i1Thank you.
It's Haruki, meaning "spring tree."it's literally "written with the characters for spring and tree", but I hate that since it requires some familiarity with kanji to really get. this is also kinda bad since you don't usually just randomly blurt out what your name means when you tell someone your name, but we need to somehow get across that his name means "spring"
Hey, you.
You didn't come to Sakura's funeral, did you?
She passed away after being in the wrong place at the wrong time,
No matter how much Sakura loved, cared for, and needed you,
if you're one day able to forgive me...
i1Being with people is really difficult.
i1Someone able to acknowledge others, and to love others.
Let's become happy, the two of us.
Here, have this.
Thanks.
was held on a rainy day.
This is the last message I ever sent her.It's an email, so message works best here.
No running in the library.Alt: This is a library so no running.
Ask what?
Oh, come on...
Huh?
Well then...Alt: Here.
an8i1I repeat.
You don't have anything like that?
Something does seem to be going around.
I want you to keep my illness a secret.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your short life in a library?
It's amazing what humans can do.Dub: Humans can be pretty amazing sometimes, don't you think?
and apparently, there's people in other countries who believe that if you have someone eat you,foreign countries is what she says but that makes little sense in English
Everyone just sees me as a boring classmate,"the boring classmate" ?
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
This is your fault, not hers!
Why... did you have to go... and do something like that?
Hey.
Do you know why cherry blossoms bloom in spring?
Actually, the three of us should totally come here sometime!
so we need to make sure we can talk as much as possible.PAR: so we have to make sure to keep close frequent contact.
an8i1And now, let's take a look at the weather.
Hey!
an8Good morning.
Great at sports, and has both looks and smarts.
You know it!
Oops.
I just want to eat what I want to eat.
Where is this coming from?
You know, I...
broke up with my boyfriend recently.
There's no way I'd tell him that.PAR: I'd never tell my boyfriend that.
Listen, Sakura, it's not that I want to complain.
You're probably the only one
But you two seem to be pretty close lately.
I-I wasn't slacking off!
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I want to go on a train trip over the break!
Change of clothes?
Although I am pretty surprised your parents actually let you go on this trip.
In order to keep my parents from worrying,
Yeah, no issue there.
All right, fine.
No, I'm sure of it!
an8I'm terribly sorry.
What?Dub: What's up?
You do that!
First off, we play ten rounds.
Oh? So you've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
Well yeah, obviously!
Shut up.
What hobby have you kept up the longest?
My strength is being able to get along with everyone.
Come on...
Ow.
That's why I told you...
Which card do you want?
You lied to your parents and said you were on a trip with me, right?!
I'm not alone.
Don't tell me...
So even if you can't accept it, please forgive me.
All right, fine.
i1I'll tell him.
It was fun.
You think you can do that?52:37
It's really good, so I want to hear what you think about it!impression; thoughts; what you have to say about it.
If you ever feel like it, huh?
Yeah?
Lend me that book.
This is a hug.
The naughty part
Do you really think it's okay to do something like this to a girl?!
and today you even went to her house!
You're awful!You disgust me!
Are you okay?
That's not true.
It wasn't a coincidence that you and I were in the same class, either.
and brought us together!Dub: and created the path that led us together.
I always read books in the order they're placed on the bookshelf,
If you did, I'm sure they'll see that you're a pretty fun guy.
Nobody wants to talk to a boring classmate.
Okay.
I believe life itself shows us that.
That's what being alive is about.Dub: 'Those prove your alive.' I like it but the more literal translation works fine.
My heart only exists because of everyone else in my life.Alt: around me
It's embarrassing me.
Nope, not at all.
an8Kyoko?
Not happening!
Okay, thanks.
There's something I want you to do for me.
You can see this place from the hospital!
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
Come on, you're not being very honest.Alt: Come one, you can come clean about it.
Then you should've bought an ice pop instead of those things!
Well, you guys have fun.
I felt like I'd changed.
I'm waiting for you at Cafe Spring.
It's not like you to say something so nice!Email  1:18:08
Once I'd processed my feelings, I realized something.PAR: Having sorted out my feelings, something became clear to me. 
Here, take this.
I just need a moment.Alt: I'll just go get it, so just a moment. Literally just: wait a moment, could you
Thank you.
That yakiniku was so good!
I was hospitalized.
I started crying, both out of embarrassment and relief that he'd actually come.PAR: I was so embarrassed, and so relieved that he came, that tears came out.
After that, we had fun together.
I really wish the two of them would get along...
I was so, so happy,
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow!PAR: 'I'm getting discharged tomorrow!' Either works. Going with the dub for easy signs version.
I've written messages to a bunch of people,
It's the least I can do to thank you for all you've done for me.
there were plenty of times when I thought I'd fallen in love with you.
Why don't you ever call me by my name?
If I'm right, leave an offering or something by my grave.
That goes for everyone, right?
Like I told you before,
But even though I wasn't anyone special,
I know you might not like it,
Huh?
And by the way,This could be anything that fits really. She like trying to get his attention in a rudepushy way. So explain to me. Tell me.
I think this is the first time we've really talked, huh?
Her Will...
Why keep it from me?Why wasn't I told?
You know how I am,
I'll learn to stand on my own.
Let's be happy.
You come all this way to Sakura's grave just to confess to me?
Let's go to Sakura's place already.
As proof of the life she lived,
Nobody? Are you getting into cannibalism?PAR: Excuse me? Did you suddenly realize you're a cannibal?
Oh, come on...
Anyway, I have to go to the front desk.
What happened to you today?
Something does seem to be going around.
I'm going to be late for the streetcar.I'd go with tram but American English is preferred, and trolley just reminds me of a shopping cart.
But the following week,
Do you have any plans after this?
When someone asks me about my favorite food, I usually say, Offal.
Hey mister! More tripe and heart please!
By the way, is there really no one in our class you're close to?Dub: do you really not get along with anyone in our class?
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
That's why I don't have any interest in other people.Sound weird but using  is this sense is strange anyway. Official: 'That's why I don't care about other people,'
Don't insult me!PAR: Don't treat me like an idiot! Alt: Don't make fun of me!
What perfect weather!Alt: What a beautiful day!
Maybe I should die on a day like this.
What a mess.
What's going on?
an8Are you deaf?
an8Hey, could you watch the store for a bit?
Oh, she got both of them good.
Welcome back.
It was so much fun!
Morning, everyone.
I see...
Wanting to keep your illness a secret is part of it, you know.
We're in a library.
Because you'll die soon?
Of course not.
Yeah, I told you that this morning.
Listen, Sakura, it's not that I want to complain.
Are you dating?
What?!
Sure am.
You're probably the only one
Thanks.
A fleeting summer's love.
you still want to have a boyfriend?another boyfriend but not in the JP
What are you trying to say?Alt: What do you mean?; What are you getting at?
Huh? Is that all the stuff you're bringing?
What about a change of clothes?
Can't you just say it's my way of making sure that no one gets hurt?Pushing it for onscreen time but it's ok.
Hey, so about your last name...
Yeah, no issue there.
Wow, I can smell ramen!Alt: noodles! Leaving this as ramen. Be strange to know about anime and not ramen.
At least my brain's working, unlike yours.Alt: 'I'm glad it's that and not my brain, like you.'; 'At least it not my brain that's not working, like yours isn't.
Huh?
Are you stupid?Official: Don't be stupid?
Come on, say something!
It's all part of the game.Official: That's how the game works.
By the way, if you pick dare,
So what about me then?
I'm not sure what's obvious about it.
Is that it?
Shut up.
My childhood, huh?
The one closest to me.
Which card do you want?
Seven.
Truth or dare?
what would you do?
Good morning, Kyoko.
You lied to your parents and said you were on a trip with me, right?!
So even if you can't accept it, please forgive me.
Yeah. Got it.
What about princess-carrying me to bed?
Either way, if Kyoko finds out, she'll kill you.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
was a word of warning from her guardian.
How do you actually feel about Sakura?PAR: 'What is Sakura to you?'
So all the returned books are back where they belong.
I was talking to someone.
I don't really read books,
It's really good, so I want to hear what you think about it!impression; thoughts; what you have to say about it.
Hey, so...
You'd never want me as your girlfriend, no matter what, right?Dub: Am I right in saying that you have absolutely no interest in me as a girlfriend?
That's a relief.
Wait, what's gotten into you?
I said it's Sakura, right? Answer me!
You're awful!You disgust me!
I knew a person like me should never have tried to get involved with others.
you should be with someone who truly cares for you, like him or Kyoko!
And then
you agreed to do the things I asked you to do.
and brought us together!Dub: and created the path that led us together.
I'm sorry... about before.
For a little longer...
Just a little bit longer...
That's not true.
I always read books in the order they're placed on the bookshelf,
When we'd gotten about halfway through her list,
What did you tell your best friend about being in hospital?
Has the rest of the class said anything?
You did lend me that book.
Hey, don't ignore me.
Show a bit more interest in my life!
Let's see...Hmm...
If you're alone, you don't even know if you really exist.
I think the relationships you have with others are what show that you're alive.
Where's all this coming from?
Thank you.
Hey, what are you two doing?!
I missed you so much!
I hear Kyoko came by today?
Hey, Mom...
You're not going to die, right?
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
You want me to live?
That I wanted to go and see fireworks.
Well, I won't deny that.
Yeah?Alt: 'What?' This doesn't fit his tone of voice.
Hey, stop it already!
Here!
Just leaving the house now.
What!? You actually remembered that place!Email  1:18:08
The complete opposite of me.
And the truth is, I probably always wanted to be like you.
Someone who can accept others.
an8i1He announced that they are working to swiftly resolve the situation.
Yeah, you're right.
She told me about it.
So...
I never imagined this would be how things would play out.
She kept it a secret from everyone in class except me.Alt: she didn't tell anyone in class except me.
I'm so glad...
He doesn't seem to have many friends, so he'll probably keep it to himself.
That yakiniku was so good!
I'll write about my trip when I get back.
After that, we had fun together.
I really wish the two of them would get along...
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow!PAR: 'I'm getting discharged tomorrow!' Either works. Going with the dub for easy signs version.
Yaaaay!Dub: Woohoo!
And lastly, to you...
I'll tell you what I wanted to ask you.
It was...
Why don't you ever call me by my name?
that's what being alive means to me.
I always thought I was basically the same as the other hundreds of thousands of high school kids,
You know what?
But I shouldn't be using an expression like that.Official: But that doesn't really get the idea across, does it?
Yes?Official: What is it?
I'm the one...
What's your first name?
Haruki Shiga.
What a perfect name to go with Sakura.Dub: to match Sakura's.
What's your first name?
It's Haruki.Haruki, why?
You know, cherry blossoms and spring.
Sorry.
You're right.
I wanted to show you this.
In her will, she asked me to have it.
She didn't tell anyone besides me.Alt: I was the only one she told
Sakura...
It was really difficult for me to reach out to other people.
to be the kind of person you were.
Someone who could accept others...Same as  1:17:13
Well, see you later.
I mean in general.
Oh...
So that's how it is.
Same difference!
Oh, that's right, I saw the coolest thing on TV yesterday.
I want to eat your pancreas!
Really? I wanna see!
I don't know about that.
No.Alt: I don't.
What a coincidence!
A cold?
Something does seem to be going around.
But hold up a second.
I'm good.
Yes.
What were you expecting?
You're contradicting what you said earlier.Official: That's the exact opposite of what you said a second ago.
You can't be very busy with no friends, right?Alt: Being friendless means you'd have plenty of free time, right?
That's sweetbread. You know, the pancreas.
By the way, is there really no one in our class you're close to?Dub: do you really not get along with anyone in our class?
Then, what do you think about how I see you?
Who knows?
What's that mean?
As long as no harm's done to me,
You probably didn't mean to,insultbe rude about it
Or you sayin' you'll pay for her?
You're the ones at fault here!
Couldn't you hear me?
You lookin' for a world of hurt?!
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
This is for the old lady!
Nice one!
Ouch, that gotta hurt.
See ya, ma'am!
Huh?
Oh, come on. Just give me your phone.
And he's our hottie class rep!
I'm just saying it's a waste!
Keep it down.
Or are you trying to make me fat?
You've never wanted friends or a girlfriend?
Because you'll die soon?
Kyoko!
What is it?Alt: What's up?
Look.
Kyoko's been my best friend since junior high.
As you can see, she's pretty strong-willed,
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
Thanks.
If you think everything I say means something, you couldn't be more wrong!PAR: You're gravely mistaken if you think there's a purpose to everything I say!
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
All right, let's meet up at the station tomorrow morning!
Uniqlo?
they usually tear up and agree.
I don't know if they'd let me go on a trip with a guy, though.PAR: but a trip with a guy is would probably a bridge too far.
I'll call them later and say I'm staying at a friend's house.
Why not?
That's got to be your imagination.
No, I'm sure of it!
What?Dub: What's up?
They said it was their fault, so they gave us a way better room than what we paid for!literally: than what Iwe had bookedreserved.
You do that!
We've got a deck of cards, so let's play a game or something.I'm probably overusing the "or something", but she did say .
What's that? Sounds too philosophical for a game.Alt: 'What sort of name is that for a game? Sounds too philosophical.'
You don't know it?
Okay, I win.
It's all part of the game.Official: That's how the game works.
I think that one girl is pretty.
Okay, next round, next round.
So what about me then?
I'm not sure what's obvious about it.
What were you like when you were a little kid?
What's the saddest thing that's happened in your life?most painfulheart-breaking
Carry-me-to-bed!
I can't believe you actually did that!Translates the idea best and in the most natural way. More literally: That took me by surprise!
Iffy, iffy.
Truth or dare?
I'm not alone.
Your boyfriend?
That's if I do anything weird, right?
Hey.
Your place is in the opposite direction from mine, so no.? You live 
Come on, don't be like that.
What? You know it?
tells me exactly how little you care about books.
Eat my dust!
You weren't saying anything, which made it seem like this was serious.PAR: The mood got all serious because you wouldn't say anything!
I'm just joking around with you.
Wait! We're not done here!talking!
Listen, let me clue you in on something.
Sakura, why do care about a guy like him?
so I took care of him for you!
You're awful!You disgust me!
I did it for your sakefscx150
That's not true!
Instead of someone like me,
Each and every one of the choices that we've made have stacked up
I was again reminded...He's thinking back to the hotel when he saw all her meds. Dub: The reality of her situation became far more clear to me than it had ever been before.
Um, could we play just one round of truth or dare?
Hating someone.
Just like you and I have both chosen to live out this moment here and now.
Huh? What's wrong?
This isn't like that other time.
Well, you won't have to worry about it for a while, though.Official: Well, it won't be for a while, though.
Something felt off about her in that hospital room.
It's fine, don't worry.
You really have been acting strange lately.
That goes for both of us.
Oh, it's starting!
So...
You got a girlfriend, right?
Am I wrong?
Either way, you should bring her here sometime.
No, I'll pass.Alt: Thanks, but I'm good.
All right! Let's go find what we want.Literally just, 'let's go choose'
Well, you guys have fun.
I bet if you asked her,
And the truth is, I probably always wanted to be like you.
an8i1was found collapsed on a road with a stab wound to the chest.
I had to pull myself together...suck it up
Here, take this.
Um...
Living With Dying.
She wanted me to pass on this diary to a certain person after she died.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
But he wasn't surprised by it at all.PAR: But he was completely unfazed.
He's always read a book.
And I had so much fun today!
When I'm with him, I start to feel a little better.
I want to do something naughty with a boy I'm not dating, at some point.
I'm a little...
Huh?
And lastly, to you...
there were plenty of times when I thought I'd fallen in love with you.
Were you scared of turning me into someone important in your mind?
How's that for a guess?
Like I told you before,
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
Just like the cherry blossoms waiting for spring!
but I've decided...
It must've been you.
And by the way,This could be anything that fits really. She like trying to get his attention in a rudepushy way. So explain to me. Tell me.
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
Thanks for coming.
Sorry.
Sakura...
I'm sorry. But even if it's gradual,
...I'd really like to be your friend!Literally more like 'become friends.' Alt: 'Maybe someday we could become friends!'; 'Iyou could be yourmy friend!' Dub: 'the two of us could become friends!'
Just a single sentence.
Those are historical fiction, and this shelf is for history books.
What I'm saying is...
Come on!
I call it Living With Dying.
You don't think I'm joking, do you?
No.Alt: I don't.
You don't have any friends?
I'm good.
But the following week,
Not at all.
Yet you're not doing them right now.
I'm writing a list of all the things I want to do before dying in this book,
Sure thing!Alt: 'Coming right up!' Do wait staff actually say that?
You can eat my pancreas if you want.
your soul lives on inside them.
I realized I don't know a thing about you.
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
Huh?
Apologize to her!
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
Why... did you have to go... and do something like that?
Hey, give me your contact info!
I'm home.
Want some dinner?
Hey, so did you hear?
Right? I can totally hook you up with a better guy.
Thank you!
We're in a library.
I highly recommend the shortcake at this place.Alt: It's gotta be the shortcake, here.
Listen, are you trying to get fat?
You're only bringing me to all-you-can-eats.
He's in our class.
You see, he's a great person to have as a friend,
Look.
What?!
Kyoko! We're leaving!PAR: heading out
an8Sorry. So how much do I owe you?
You're not going to tell your best friend about your illness?PAR: Shouldn't you tell that best friend about your disease?
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
who can give me the truth and a normal life.reality actually fits better as PAR used, but it doesn't work with "a normal life".
The doctors only ever give me the truth.
and still lets me have a normal life.
is fun!
I didn't mean anything in particular.
Get there?
Feels more like a kidnapping than a trip, if you ask me.
I'm lying to them about having friends.Official: I've been lying to them about having friends so they wouldn't worry.
Yes?
Hey.
You don't always get a nice room like this, so you have to try the bed, too!Experience or enjoy the bed
Fine, I'll have a quick lie-down later.
Who do you think is cutest girl in our class?
It's all part of the game.Official: That's how the game works.
So what about me then?
Oh? So you've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
It's like, I know I'm the one who asked,
That caught me off guard.
My childhood, huh?
Hey, is this some kind of interview?
All these serious questions are making this boring.Official: All your questions are so serious. it's boring.
Which one do you want?
Hooray!
Thanks.
You should really drink some water.
Iffy, iffy.
Truth.
If I told you that I'm actually super scared of dying,
i1You're not like some cat who's about to die.
Come home safe. And buy me a souvenir.
Yeah.
Well, that was over quick.
Leave me alone.PAR: Don't play games with me.
Let's go on another trip sometime.
No one's home.
but ever since I was little, there's been one book I've loved.
By Saint-Exupry?
What? You know it?
If I ever feel like it.
That was embarrassing.
Sakura!
What a coincidence.
I hate you now!Name won't sound natural here.
Don't you dare bother me or the people around me again!
That's not true.
For a little longer...
Just a little bit longer...
I always read books in the order they're placed on the bookshelf,
so it might be a while.
Because I'm hanging out with you, right?PAR: Because I'm with you a lot, right?
Are you still trying to imagine how they all feel about you?
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
That's where the purpose to being alive comes from.
Then what?
I'll admit confession.
This way!
You really have been acting strange lately.
That goes for both of us.
Very much.
I made you worry for nothing.
Then just a friend of yours, huh?
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Hey, stop it already!
I'm waiting for you at Cafe Spring.
Well, I was just thinking of you.Alt freer: I was just thinking about what you might like.
Someone who can be accepted.
Yeah, you're right.
She broke her promise of telling me when she was going to die.
Living With Dying.
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
He just happened to find this book at the hospital, and started reading it.Narrated so "this Living With Dying" is not translating properly.
But he wasn't surprised by it at all.PAR: But he was completely unfazed.
I'm easy like that! Pushing it for onscreen time but don't like this bleeding over.
When I'm with him, I start to feel a little better.
After he left, I started crying.
So I'm glad that we became so close.
You really are an amazing person.
You created your own charm,
That day when you told me you wanted me to live...
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
Maybe I've spent 17 years waiting to be needed by you.
but I've decided...
I want to eat your pancreas.
maybe you and Kyoko can come over and join our family for dinner someday?
What's your first name?
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
What is it?
You're lying. I don't know anything about that.PAR: I would have known.
Stop it.
I want you to read this.
I would've spent even more time with her!
No matter how much Sakura loved you, cared about you, or needed you,Official: No matter how much Sakura liked you, how important you were to her, how much she needed you...
Sorry! I'm late because of extra classes.Official: I had to stay after class.
Just memorize the classification numbers.
Oh, that's right, I saw the coolest thing on TV yesterday.
Ask what?
Oh, come on...
an8i1Ticket holder 54, please proceed to counter A2.
Well then...Alt: Here.
What?!
Normally, you'd act surprised,
No.Alt: I don't.
What?Alt: Seriously; Really
Maybe go and meet up with your first crush.
I'm writing a list of all the things I want to do before dying in this book,
Do you have any plans after this?
Oh?
Oh, that's not what I meant.
Hey!
Top of the list: entrails!
By the way, is there really no one in our class you're close to?Dub: do you really not get along with anyone in our class?
or something worse.
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
Then, what do you think about how I see you?
Or maybe, a classmate who knows my secret.
You probably didn't mean to,insultbe rude about it
Hey! What're you waiting for?
Hey, you littlefscx150
Man, that was scary.
Isn't that wonderful?
Everybody's saying you were hanging out together yesterday.
Good morning.
I already listened to it, so you can borrow it.
Yeah. What about it?
Paradise!
He's in our class.
but he didn't really work out as a boyfriend.
so at first I thought she was kinda scary,
She gets pretty emotional, you know.
But you two seem to be pretty close lately.
Something happen?
Huh? Is that all the stuff you're bringing?
I don't know if they'd let me go on a trip with a guy, though.PAR: but a trip with a guy is would probably a bridge too far.
That's got to be your imagination.
I saw a policeman on TV saying that they're the hardest kind of bad guy to catch.
Yes?
Huh?
I'll be sleeping over here.
Truth.
I'm just going off the people I remember, but...
The one closest to me.
Dare.
i1Sakura! Where the hell are you?!
All right, fine.
but apparently Kyoko is out to kill you.
Oh, so that's what it's called.
Well, that was over quick.
Well, this is my stop.
And then it occurred to me.Dub: 'And then it hit me.' Most natural, but not sure how well this reads as subs.
She may not look it, but she gets hurt a lot easier than most people.
She was the same when her favorite teacher moved away, transferred. It can mean change jobs which is how PAR translated but transferred is more likely.
Huh?
Want to come over to my place today?
I don't really read books,
Sounds like you've read it, then?
No, I wouldn't.
Did I make your heart race?Alt: Did I make you nervous?
My relationship with her isn't what you think it is.
The whole class is talking about you!
And yet Sakura'sshe's still spending her time with you.
I was just talking to him about you.
Sakura, why do care about a guy like him?
Don't you dare bother me or the people around me again!
I did it for your sakefscx150
Come back inside. Then I can give you a change of clothes.
When we'd gotten about halfway through her list,
I was again reminded...He's thinking back to the hotel when he saw all her meds. Dub: The reality of her situation became far more clear to me than it had ever been before.
Do you know why things have gotten like that?
What does...
Being alive, huh?
means reaching out to the hearts of others.PAR: means having a bond with others.
I believe life itself shows us that.
Accepting someone.
My heart only exists because of everyone else in my life.Alt: around me
Just like you and I have both chosen to live out this moment here and now.
Huh? What's wrong?
This isn't like that other time.
Are you sure nothing's bothering you?PAR: Hey, aren't you acting a little weird?
Hey, you, don't try to run away!
Not happening!
Sakura, don't talk like that.More literally: Don't talk about dying.
It's fine, don't worry.
Huh?
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
I told you before, remember?
You don't want to go?
Well, it doesn't really matter.
All right! Let's go find what we want.Literally just, 'let's go choose'
Yeah, you're right.
Be careful out there.
Are you all right?
Here, take this.
Go and give her a proper goodbye.
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
so I took a liking to him straight away.Keyframe snap is personal preference
I'll write about my trip when I get back.
I'm just not letting it show.
He walked in while I was in the middle of dancing to try and shake off my fear.PAR: He saw me when I was dancing to rid myself of my worries.
I don't know if I've ever been this happy to be alive before today.PAR: So happy that I could barely believe it.
Don't worry, I didn't write your name.Past tense since it's her will
I've written messages to a bunch of people,
You see, it seemed to me like you and I were yin and yang.
So I'm glad that we became so close.
you were afraid of making me a friend or a girlfriend.
I looked up to you.
i1You're right.
That day when you were really worried about me...
I felt like I was someone truly unique for the first time in my life.PAR: 'I was able to think of myself as the one and only me out there for the first time in my life.'
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
Just like the cherry blossoms waiting for spring!
I think it's pretty amazing how you're able to make someone so happy.
That I'd like to take a leaf out of your book.
That my words had reached you.His last email
You and I really are...
All the choices I made were so I could meet you!Not identical but similar to 1:34:35
I wanted to show you this.
What is it?
Stop it.
but she'd never do anything that would hurt you.Alt: but she'd never playpull a prankjoke that would hurt you.
If you'd told me...
I want you to forgive me.
It was really difficult for me to reach out to other people.
Someone who could accept others...Same as  1:17:13
Let's be happy.
What's that mean?
Let's go to Sakura's place already.
Just a single sentence.
No running in the library.Alt: This is a library so no running.
What are you doing?
Just memorize the classification numbers.
Keep it down.
They were saying that in the past, if there was something wrong with your liver, you'd eat a liver,
It happened in April, when the late-blooming cherry blossoms were still flush on the trees.
We'll have to ask her.
I'm going to die.
You don't say.Official: Oh, I see
Bye.
It'll be our little secret.
I thought we'd never have anything to do with each other again.Official: I thought I'd never talk to her again.
It's an important part of our job here at the library.
Nothing, really.
Or go hitchhiking in a foreign country and decide where you want to die.PAR: and find a nice place to die, or something.
Don't tell me eating cow entrails is also part of your treatment program?
Is that something to talk about when we're grilling meat?
Have people actually told you that?
Well, I'm interested!
I'm not sure...
an8Are you deaf?
Who the hell are you?
What's that, you stupid brat?Rhyming unintended... not sure if it works
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
You there!
Hey, you littlefscx150
Why... did you have to go... and do something like that?
They wait for it to become warm and then bloom all at once.
Cherry blossoms always wait for the right time to bloom.
Oh, come on. Just give me your phone.
Want some gum?
Well, let me know if anything interesting happens.PAR: lemme. I dunno, not sure about this contraction in a sub.
Good morning.
Sakura,
Never?
Oh, it's someone you know, by the way.
Kyoko!
Look.
But you're the one person who knows the truth
This might be my last summer, so I gotta enjoy it to the fullest.
You need to spend more time reaching out to people!Alt: 'Use that time to reach out to people!'  reach out to; interact; connect with. Distant synonym: socialize
We're not.
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
And don't you dare stand me up!
Although I am pretty surprised your parents actually let you go on this trip.
they usually tear up and agree.
If I tell you, you'll just write it in there, won't you?
No, I'm sure of it!
At least my brain's working, unlike yours.Alt: 'I'm glad it's that and not my brain, like you.'; 'At least it not my brain that's not working, like yours isn't.
I saw a policeman on TV saying that they're the hardest kind of bad guy to catch.
You really can't trust a saying, then.
Then I'll explain as we go.
Who came up with this game? The devil?
If I had to go with someone...
So what about me then?
It's like, I know I'm the one who asked,
My childhood, huh?
I'd get in fights with the biggest guy in the class.
Basically, I was a problem child.
Meeting you, maybe!
Thirteen.
Are you okay?
The one next to my glass.
Iffy, iffy.
what would you do?
What? Who's with you?
I'll make sure I explain all of this to you someday.
You might have heard that,
That jacket looks good on you.
It's embarrassing.
That sounds good.
I was waiting for her to contact me.
She was so depressed that I thought she'd never get back on her feet again.
How do you actually feel about Sakura?PAR: 'What is Sakura to you?'
I already took care of all the work.
Come on, don't be like that.
By Saint-Exupry?
tells me exactly how little you care about books.
Hey.
I doubt that I could even if I wanted to. I don't even have friends.
I'm just making sure.
No, I wouldn't.
This is one of them.
Fooled you!
You weren't saying anything, which made it seem like this was serious.PAR: The mood got all serious because you wouldn't say anything!
Let me go. This hurts.
What are you doing here?
A guy like him? What do you mean?
Don't tell me you think you're better than him?
It wasn't a coincidence that you and I were in the same class, either.
You like books, so you picked it up out of curiosity.
I'm sorry... about before.
So...
but I'm fine.
It totally sucks.
The next town over is holding one later, so we can just go to that one instead.
Has the rest of the class said anything?
Only that supposedly I've been stalking you, and that's why you've been skipping school. Literally: absent. Alt: missing; haven't been around; away. PAR: They're saying that the reason for your absence is me stalking you.
Wrong.Dub: No, silly
It's because you don't talk to them.enough
I didn't see that coming.
Show a bit more interest in my life!
Being alive...
Hey...
Hey, what are you two doing?!
You'll have plenty of time for that later!Literally more like: 'I'll give you'... but that doesn't fit here
There's something I want you to do for me.
that I was scared out of my mind.
You can see this place from the hospital!
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
Well, I won't deny that.
Come on, you're not being very honest.
I didn't say that.
Before long, the day came when the hospital let her go home.literally 'discharged' but this translation sounds more natural.
She's neither, and I'm not bringing her here.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
I'm glad that you finally have someone who can see you for who you truly are.a lot of 'you' here
Huh?
Yo!
That gum...
Sure, no problem.
No...
You truly are an amazing person.
And the truth is, I probably always wanted to be like you.
Someone who can be accepted.
Are you all right?
an8i1However, she died shortly after.
Are you okay?
she said he'd come to get this no matter what.
Thanks to you, she'll...
April 22.
When I'm with him, I start to feel a little better.
I don't know if I've ever been this happy to be alive before today.PAR: So happy that I could barely believe it.
that when I was alone again, the tears wouldn't stop.
I'm sure that what she wanted you to read is further in.
I'll tell you what I wanted to ask you.
Were you scared of turning me into someone important in your mind?
That's also why I refused to say your name.PAR: 'So I got stubborn, and avoided using your name in turn.' Sounds a bit odd
Did you notice?
that's what being alive means to me.
So I came up with this.something
Yes?Official: What is it?
I'm so glad I talked to you that day!'that day' is implied in the JP
Huh?
It must've been you.
Why not?
Get to the point.Official: Make it quick.
You're lying. I don't know anything about that.PAR: I would have known.
but even if she hadn't been there, she'd stillfscx150
but she'd never do anything that would hurt you.Alt: but she'd never playpull a prankjoke that would hurt you.
It's because shefscx150
If you'd told me...
Wait up!
I want you to forgive me.
You're right.
Sakura's waiting for us.
The funeral of my classmate, Yamauchi Sakura,
As proof of the life she lived,
Oh, come on...
We'll have to ask her.
My pancreas has stopped working,
You don't say.Official: Oh, I see
Just one last thing.
I won't tell anyone.
What were you expecting?
Or go hitchhiking in a foreign country and decide where you want to die.PAR: and find a nice place to die, or something.
It's amazing what humans can do.Dub: Humans can be pretty amazing sometimes, don't you think?
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
it doesn't matter if they like me or hate me.
Huh?
Who the hell are you?
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
Hey, look at this!Alt: Check this out!
so we need to make sure we can talk as much as possible.PAR: so we have to make sure to keep close frequent contact.
Welcome back.
Want some dinner?
Thanks for hanging out with me.Dub: Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today.
Oh, he's here.
'Kay.PAR: Aight!
Well, let me know if anything interesting happens.PAR: lemme. I dunno, not sure about this contraction in a sub.
Hey!
Sakura,
Oh, come on, what's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, that's it!
Keep it down.
Then what?!
She's a nice girl, so you should try and get along with her, too.
Nah, it's fine.Dub: It's better that way.
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
The doctors only ever give me the truth.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
Wanna go out for karaoke?
FYI, I'm into more refined girls.Not sure about FYI but it fits well.
So you really were slacking off.
I'll get straight to the point: are you free?
I told them I was going with Kyoko.
So what's your first name, anyway?
That's got to be your imagination.
No, I'm sure of it!
an8I'm terribly sorry.
Could you get me the facial cleanser from my bag?
Thanks!
Here, this is yours.
Playing cards with two people is depressing.
Well, since we're already drinking,
First off, we play ten rounds.
But if you do that, I'll order you to do something,
Are you stupid?To match line  34:08
So girls like that are your type, huh?
So what about me then?
Hooray!
Are you okay?
so can you pick one?
If I told you that I'm actually super scared of dying,
All right, fine.
And also,
Well, that was over quick.
After the break was over, though, all that awaited me
She was so depressed that I thought she'd never get back on her feet again.
I said it's Sakura, right? Answer me!
And yet Sakura'sshe's still spending her time with you.
Why...
What the hell do you know?!
Don't tell me you think you're better than him?
For a little longer...
That much I knew.PAR: I shouldn't have been surprised.
Only that supposedly I've been stalking you, and that's why you've been skipping school. Literally: absent. Alt: missing; haven't been around; away. PAR: They're saying that the reason for your absence is me stalking you.
You did lend me that book.
Thanks.
You need to start with an interest in othersfscx150
What does being alive mean to you?
Yeah, that's it.Dub: I got it

That's where the purpose to being alive comes from.
Hey...
I just want to enjoy the truth and the normal life that you give me.PAR: I just want a taste of your reality and normalcy.
I want to borrow your warmth!
Honestly...
Okay.

What is it?
Hey.
Thanks.

Isn't that right nearby?
an8i1The suspect fled, but was later arrested and has admitted to the crime.

I never imagined this would be how things would play out.
There was one other thing I wanted to do, besides pay my respects.PAR: I actually have something else to ask.
Living With Dying.
But he wasn't surprised by it at all.PAR: But he was completely unfazed.
He's an interesting guy.
It's like he's engaged in a silent battle against himself.PAR: and I get the feeling he's struggling with himself.
When I'm with him, I start to feel a little better.
I was hospitalized.
But I'm not letting it show.Dub: But I won't let anyone see that I am. PAR: I'm putting up a front for the others.
I'm not lying to them.
I almost cried again.
I'm so happy.
I don't know if I've ever been this happy to be alive before today.PAR: So happy that I could barely believe it.
that when I was alone again, the tears wouldn't stop.
And lastly, to you...
Don't worry, I didn't write your name.Past tense since it's her will
I already let my mom know.
I've written messages to a bunch of people,
I always thought I was basically the same as the other hundreds of thousands of high school kids,
And of course we did.
What's your first name?
Shiga Haruki.
You know, cherry blossoms and spring.
Get to the point.Official: Make it quick.
This is Living with Dying.
What are you talking about?
Sakura...
I could've been with Sakura...
I'm sorry. But even if it's gradual,
I want you to forgive me.
And if you can do that...Dub: If you ever find it in your heart to do that... This is good but I don't want to keep copying the dub.
Well, see you later.
I'm sure that'll motivate him to study for exams, too.
What I'm saying is...
Ask what?
Oh, come on...
or say something sort of comforting like, the cute ones die young.the fairest flowers soonest fade
No.Alt: I don't.
I'm sorry, but I don't have time for your coincidences.
Man, that was heavy.
Yet you're not doing them right now.
Don't be like that. Here, eat some more offal.Dub: organ meats
your soul lives on inside them.
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
As long as no harm's done to me,
it doesn't matter if they like me or hate me.
I wouldn't invite someone I'm not interested in!
Even though I do think you're a bit of an idiot sometimes, I wasn't insulting you.
You probably didn't mean to,insultbe rude about it
Are you still sulking?
Not especially.
What a mess.
an8Hey! Say something!
Hey! What're you waiting for?
Cough up the dough already!
Huh?
Spring goes hand in hand with cherry blossoms.Spring flowers
Do you know why cherry blossoms bloom in spring?
so we need to make sure we can talk as much as possible.PAR: so we have to make sure to keep close frequent contact.
an8i1And now, let's take a look at the weather.
What a day!Alt: Today was great! Dub: It's me!
Hey, so did you hear?
Not really.
Good morning.
I'm telling you, it's not like that.
I'm just saying it's a waste!
I'd rather not have everyone ridicule me again.Alt: make fun of me again.
Yeah, that's it!
Complete opposites!
Where to?
Of course not.
It might have been fun to have a friend or two,
Man, I didn't expect Kyoko to be here too.
Nah, it's fine.Dub: It's better that way.
She gets pretty emotional, you know.
I only talk to you about this stuff.PAR: You're the only one I can talk about this with.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
What's wrong?
I didn't mean anything in particular.
Stop reading books all the time!
Nice idea, I'm in!sounds good
That's way off.
Good morning.
I'm sure they'll have a Uniqlo outlet.store
I told them I was going with Kyoko.
Can't you just say it's my way of making sure that no one gets hurt?Pushing it for onscreen time but it's ok.
Thanks.
Could you not write my name in that?
All right, fine.
Anyway, things have gotten pretty dangerous lately.
Yes?
I'll be sleeping over here.
You don't always get a nice room like this, so you have to try the bed too!Experience or enjoy the bed
Talk about awkward!Literally: 'it's embarrassing.' She means the silence.
No.
First off, we play ten rounds.
You're not allowed to quit partway.
Truth.
But if you do that, I'll order you to do something,
Who came up with this game? The devil?
Oh? So you've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
Is that it?
Thirteen.
Ow.
Thanks.
I can't believe you actually did that!Translates the idea best and in the most natural way. More literally: That took me by surprise!
The one next to my glass.
No arguing, no resisting.
They called here, and I had a really hard time trying to cover for you!, you know!
I knew I could count on you, Kyoko. Thanks.
i1You're not like some cat who's about to die.
Come home safe. And buy me a souvenir.
Yeah.
What?
For the first few days after I got home,
In junior high, she spent the whole night crying after breaking up with her boyfriend.
Hey, are you even listening?!
You think you can do that?52:37
I already took care of all the work.
What book is it?
By Saint-Exupry?
If I ever feel like it.
Yeah?
Let me go!
No...
Won't take no for an answer?!
Sakura!
Are you okay?
Besides, you and I...
It wasn't a coincidence.
Everyone is where they are now because of the choices they've made.
But you have to know...
I don't think there's anything I can do for you.
When we'd gotten about halfway through her list,
That much I knew.PAR: I shouldn't have been surprised.
My parents just freaked out because some my numbers were a little off,PAR: Some of my numbers were a little off, so my parents got worried and made a fuss,
What did you tell your best friend about being in hospital?
Why bother doing anything if it's not going to benefit anyone?
You need to start with an interest in othersfscx150
Having fun being with someone.
That's where the purpose to being alive comes from.
Hey, what are you two doing?!
I missed you so much!
Hey, Mom...
I headed straight to the hospital after school.
It's fine, don't worry.
You can see this place from the hospital!
I knew this spot would be a hidden gem.PAR: I knew it had to be a little-known spot.
Couldn't this night view wait until after you get out of the hospital?Added lead out to give this more onscreen time. Preferred if not for the onscreen time: If it's just for the night view, couldn't you wait until you get out of hospital?
You really have been acting strange lately.
I just thought I'm so lucky to have someone who cares so much about me.
Don't worry.
Oh come on, did you really think I couldn't see through your lies?
I'm Just meeting up with someone.
Then you should've bought an ice pop instead of those things!
Hey, stop it already!
Sure, no problem.
Congrats on getting out of the hospital.
Unlike you, I'm perfectly healthy.Email  1:18:08  1:33:24
Yeah, you're right.
an8i1was found collapsed on a road with a stab wound to the chest.
Are you all right?
She told me about it.
So...
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
Thanks to you, she'll...
so I took a liking to him straight away.Keyframe snap is personal preference
I was hospitalized.
They said something about numbers being off.PAR: Some numbers were wrong or something like that.
No, I won't lie here.Dub: Well, there's no point in me lying here.
But I'm not letting it show.Dub: But I won't let anyone see that I am. PAR: I'm putting up a front for the others.
If I'm right, leave an offering or something by my grave.
i1Like you say, I'm just a coward.
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
Maybe I've spent 17 years waiting to be needed by you.
Oh, right.
What's your first name?
It must've been you.
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
You're right.
She liked to joke around,
but she'd never do anything that would hurt you.Alt: but she'd never playpull a prankjoke that would hurt you.
It's because shefscx150
...I'd really like to be your friend!Literally more like 'become friends.' Alt: 'Maybe someday we could become friends!'; 'Iyou could be yourmy friend!' Dub: 'the two of us could become friends!'
It was really difficult for me to reach out to other people.
But you're no longer here.I think this is connected to the previous line, not the following, but not sure how to work it that way.
Let's be happy.
So that's how it is.

What?! There's too many, though!
They said Aunt Akane had her baby.
I call it Living With Dying.
Were you listening?!
No.Alt: I don't.
Hey, that was the first time we ever spoke to one another, right?
Something does seem to be going around.
It'll be our little secret.
Then what about you? Don't you have things you want to do before you die?
I suppose I do.
What?
You can eat my pancreas if you want.
and apparently, there's people in other countries who believe that if you have someone eat you,foreign countries is what she says but that makes little sense in English
Your soul's probably really obnoxious.
No, they haven't.
All that matters is what I think.
Like I said, either way, the truth doesn't really matter to me.truth added so it's clear what he means. 'it doesn't really matter' is a bit ambiguous
I'm not sure...
an8Are you deaf?
You're the ones at fault here!
This is your fault, not hers!
In front of all these people?
Hey, hold it!
H-Hey, wait
Hey.
Morning, everyone.
Right? I can totally hook you up with a better guy.
Good morning.
Sakura,
an8Yo!
Oh, come on, what's that supposed to mean?
I'd rather not have everyone ridicule me again.Alt: make fun of me again.
It might have been fun to have a friend or two,
but he didn't really work out as a boyfriend.
Kyoko!
What's that even supposed to mean?!
an8Sorry. So how much do I owe you?
so at first I thought she was kinda scary,
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
Sure am.
who can give me the truth and a normal life.reality actually fits better as PAR used, but it doesn't work with "a normal life".
The doctors only ever give me the truth.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
The hot weather's great, isn't it?Official: It's nice when it's hot out. PAR: Hot weather has its own charm.
Want some gum?
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
I didn't kick you that hard!
Finally!
I'm sure they'll have a Uniqlo outlet.store
Uniqlo?
Feels more like a kidnapping than a trip, if you ask me.
Can't you just say it's my way of making sure that no one gets hurt?Pushing it for onscreen time but it's ok.
If I tell you, you'll just write it in there, won't you?
Wow, I can smell ramen!Alt: noodles! Leaving this as ramen. Be strange to know about anime and not ramen.
You really can't trust a saying, then.
You don't always get a nice room like this, so you have to try the bed too!Experience or enjoy the bed
By the way, I'm butt naked right now!
Talk about awkward!Literally: 'it's embarrassing.' She means the silence.
We each pick a card, and the one with the highest number is the winner.
It's all part of the game.Official: That's how the game works.
Oh? So you've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
That caught me off guard.
I'm not sure what's obvious about it.
What were you like when you were a little kid?
My childhood, huh?
What hobby have you kept up the longest?
My strength is being able to get along with everyone.
Two more rounds.
Are you okay?
Which card do you want?
Iffy!
What should I go with...
Want some water?
What about princess-carrying me to bed?
For the first few days after I got home,
Would you say something?!
Huh?
No one's home.
And here I was all excited, thinking you might not know it since it's a foreign book.
Sounds like you've read it, then?
Really?!
Yeah?
This is one of them.
Doing something naughty with a boy I'm not dating, and who I'm not in love with.Literally: who's not my boyfriend. But to match line  diary entry  1:25:03
The naughty part
Like I always do.
Stop it!
It's Sakura, right?
I hear her old boyfriend was like that.
Are you okay?
so I took care of him for you!
You like books, so you picked it up out of curiosity.
And that's what brought us here, at this very moment.
That's not true.
Thank you.
of her reality.Alt: of the reality of her situation.
Now I feel dumb for worrying.Swapped
My parents just freaked out because some my numbers were a little off,PAR: Some of my numbers were a little off, so my parents got worried and made a fuss,
but I'm fine.
It totally sucks.
There you go again...
Okay, go ahead. Ask me anything.
Holding someone's hand.
That's what being alive is about.Dub: 'Those prove your alive.' I like it but the more literal translation works fine.
You're always teaching me all sorts of things.
This isn't a prank.joke sounds like it could be interpreted in a few different ways
Of course I'm going to die.Alt: 'Of course I will.' Arguably a more natural response but PAR's works fine.
You want me to live?
Oh, it's starting!
That's pretty arrogant for an apology.
Yeah?Alt: 'What?' This doesn't fit his tone of voice.
Am I wrong?
A girl you like, then?got a crush on
Man, it's hot today.
Yeah!
Nice catch!
but at some point, she'd changed me.
I'm waiting for you at Cafe Spring.
That one really hurt my feelings!Email  1:18:08
Now you have to compliment me as punishment!
How can I be like you?
I was coming up to the tenth morning after she'd died.This whole sentence sounds off. You'd just say: 'it had been almost ten days since she died' but I'll keep to the JP
I had to pull myself together...suck it up
What?
Living With Dying.
I'm so glad...
I'm really so glad...
This is it, right?
so I took a liking to him straight away.Keyframe snap is personal preference
I'm just not letting it show.
Don't worry, I didn't write your name.Past tense since it's her will
It's the least I can do to thank you for all you've done for me.
So I'm glad that we became so close.
Why don't you ever call me by my name?
you were afraid of making me a friend or a girlfriend.
I looked up to you.
That day when you were really worried about me...
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
So I came up with this.something
I'm the one who lived my life just to meet you.Alt: find you. More literally just: 'I lived my life just to meet you', but it doesn't flow well from the previous line. Overall, the dub gets the idea across better: 'It's almost like you were my whole reason for living.'
I'm here. So what do you want?
Why would you know and not me?!Dub: How come you know about something that I don't?!
Wait up!
Someone who could accept others...Same as  1:17:13
Thanks.
What?! There's too many, though!
Oh, that's right, I saw the coolest thing on TV yesterday.
What I'm saying is...
Huh?
I want to eat your pancreas!
I was absent from school to get my stitches removed after an appendectomy.
We'll have to ask her.
That's not fair! What about me?
Something does seem to be going around.
It'll be our little secret.
Thanks!
What?Alt: Seriously; Really
Oh, that's right!
Do you have any plans after this?
Is that something to talk about when we're grilling meat?
I realized I don't know a thing about you.
Or maybe, a classmate who knows my secret.
As long as no harm's done to me,
Well, I'm interested!
Maybe I should die on a day like this.
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
Oh, she got both of them good.
Man, that was scary.
I think that's the first time... I've heard that used... literally.Official: I've never heard anybody say that and really mean it.
Hey, look at this!Alt: Check this out!
Are you talking about your name?
No, thanks.
Oh, he's here.
Good morning.
I'm telling you, it's not like that.
Have you even had a girlfriend?
broke up with my boyfriend recently.
What is it?Alt: What's up?
Are you dating?
Then what?!
They're desperately trying to pretend that we have a normal life.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
The hot weather's great, isn't it?Official: It's nice when it's hot out. PAR: Hot weather has its own charm.
I didn't mean anything in particular.
Go and throw this away.
I didn't kick you that hard!
I'll get straight to the point: are you free?
Huh? Is that all the stuff you're bringing?
Feels more like a kidnapping than a trip, if you ask me.
I'm lying to them about having friends.Official: I've been lying to them about having friends so they wouldn't worry.
Who cares? Not like it'll kill you.Dub: Well, duh! What's the big deal?
The only thing not working is my pancreas!
That means I ask you truth or dare.
Where did this come from?Can't think of anything better.
It's all part of the game.Official: That's how the game works.
I'm just going off the people I remember, but...
Sorry for this, but I'm going to give you both a truth and a dare this time,
All right, if you say truth, you have to tell me three things you find cute about me.
Which card do you want?
What did you get?
What should I go with...
Want some water?
Truth or dare?
If I told you that I'm actually super scared of dying,
You lied to your parents and said you were on a trip with me, right?!
i1You're not like some cat who's about to die.
And also,
i1you have to go on a trip with me over the summer break.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
was a word of warning from her guardian.
Don't get close to her with half-baked feelings.
So all the returned books are back where they belong.
Sorry.
Want to come over to my place today?
I see...
Now, now, there's no need to hurry.
You'd never want me as your girlfriend, no matter what, right?Dub: Am I right in saying that you have absolutely no interest in me as a girlfriend?
You'd fit that role just fine. could mean multiple things. Gone with the official stuff.
That was embarrassing.
That's unusually nice of you!
But you can let go now...
So he was your ex-boyfriend.
Then what was it?
All the choices I made until now...
I'm really happy that you're here right now.
I'm really sorry about before.
Thank you.
Let's get along well until I die.19:20
I was again reminded...He's thinking back to the hotel when he saw all her meds. Dub: The reality of her situation became far more clear to me than it had ever been before.
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
I really wish you'd get along with Kyoko.
Thanks.
Accepting someone.
If you're alone, you don't even know if you really exist.
You're always teaching me all sorts of things.
It's embarrassing me.
This isn't like that other time.
Nope, not at all.
I put a change of clothes in here for you.
I headed straight to the hospital after school.
I'll admit confession.
Are you planning a lovers double-suicide at a spot where we won't be found?
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
Don't worry.
So...
She's neither, and I'm not bringing her here.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
What, with Sakura again?
I felt like I'd changed.
How can I be like you?
an8i1According to reports, the girl was identified as a student at a local high school.
Yes? What is it?
Living With Dying.
So it was you...
But he's actually a lot of fun to talk to,
They said something about numbers being off.PAR: Some numbers were wrong or something like that.
No, I won't lie here.Dub: Well, there's no point in me lying here.
I've lost half the time I have left.PAR: My lifespan got cut in half. Being lazy again or sake of signs only version.
I'm giving this book to you.PAR: This book is yours now.
but I'd actually been curious about you since way before we met at the hospital.
To be completely honest,
there were plenty of times when I thought I'd fallen in love with you.
I looked up to you.
But you, and only you, were always on your own.PAR literal: were always only yourself.
But even though I wasn't anyone special,
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
That I'd like to take a leaf out of your book.
To know that you needed me.
All the choices I made, I made just so I could meet you.Tricky to split this and keep the JP structure. PAR gave it a good try but it just doesn't sound right: To meet you. I've made my choices in life for the sake of nothing else.
What's your first name?
Shiga Haruki.
What a perfect name to go with Sakura.Dub: to match Sakura's.
I'm so glad I talked to you that day!'that day' is implied in the JP
Sakura...
I would've spent even more time with her!
I could've been with Sakura...
And if you can do that...Dub: If you ever find it in your heart to do that... This is good but I don't want to keep copying the dub.
Let's be happy.
Well, just recently.Well, just recently, for your information.
So that's how it is.
What were you making for dinner tonight?
I made omelet rice!
It hasn't even started yet!
Roger!
Put your legs into it! Don't falter!
Focus!
Increase the pressure!
Sorry, are you alright!?
Where are you headed?
It's called "Sunrise Katamiya".
Ah, that's okay! I'll be fine with just some directions.
SCHOOOL! 
SCHOOOOOOOOOL! 
SCHOOOOOOOOOOL! 
Ah! My wallet!
Fire point! 6th floor outer stairs!
Any injuries?
Hinageshi! You know you're not supposed to bring belongings with you down the ladder!
Ah, wait!
Use those legs! Keep at it!
The building material on the balconies there are pretty flammable.
Seems like it's some sort of trend to upload videos like that online.
So I decided on the university here.
It does look kind of like a Barchetta doesn't it!
Seems complicated!
I'll be making egg salad sandwiches.
Ah, it's probably time we head out...
Oh, no it's fine!
Have some coffee again...
Eh?
Umm!
You're quite the looker, Mr. Flower Shop!
and try eating it this way.
Small but has spit full of deadly tetrodotoxin!
I only came to observe what kind of girlfriend you got after all
Is that so...
It's Mt. Fuji!
Amazing!
Yeah, I bet you don't know how to write my name either.
If you fry the outside well,
Isn't it hard to eat with your left hand?
So I'm sure you'll find it in no time.
But I couldn't do it no matter what I tried.
Heard of them?
Forget helping other people...
And I'm always the one being saved too...
When you need to rest...
Please call me back when you're feeling up for it.
I'll be waiting!
That's so like him...
I told him that good waves would come after it snows...
Eat up.
Have some coffee too.
Can't help it.
I just want to know...
My last name is pronounced 'Mukaimizu'...
I'll go get a dishcloth!
I wasn't supposed to be such a crybaby...
Minato?
I haven't been taking anything...
Look!
It's definitely Minato... I'm sure of it.
His ghost?
Didn't I promise to always be there for you?
I want to know why you went to go surfing by yourself without telling me.
That was...
It's true!
Oh, how greedy!
Nope!
One more.
You're saying some pretty depressing stuff.
I'll be with you for the rest of my life!
I'm here to help, and I'll be cheering you on too.
My brother told you so too, right?
She keeps talking to the water inside a bottle.
You were following her the whole time?
He was always looking at her surfing from the department roof...
though it was hard to call out to you.
Because I like you!
Even I feel he's honest, and kind...
Even if I can't hold your hand, or hug you.
They won't all be good ones, so there will be farewells too.
He told me...
I know...
With you like this Minato will never be able to pass on!
Please have a seat wherever you like.
Yeah...
It's nothing.
After graduating high school,
At work.
You want to take a look right?
But he read books,
My brother.
Made it his goal to become someone who could help others.
Was that when he was little and was saved from being drowned,
So he wanted to work to save others as well.
Coming home all of a sudden, what's the matter?
In the summer we monitor the sea during our summer camp.
And we participate in competitions as well.
Why did you want to become a firefighter, Wasabi?
That took a huge burden off my shoulders.
Do your best! You idiot!
The Oste? Isn't that the famous one with the world's largest tree inside?
Ya'll on board? We going?
The sound's louder than anything!
Hello, Youko...?
Yup. I lived in the apartment where the fire spread to!
Youko, I'll call 911.
That's huge...
Then us too!
Crap!
Ouch! I got injured in that blast earlier!
There's no elevators here!
Roger!
Roger!
It's a piece of work!
At the thirteenth floor! The fireworks are spraying everywhere, cannot proceed!
Cannot proceed, over!
The responsible parties include over 10 people, according to the source inside the building!
...managed to ride my own wave...
The blaze from the fireworks have been quelled.
A large mass of water is putting out the fire of the tree while moving upwards.
Left!
I'll be riding all sorts of waves now!
You write a message on a heart shaped card!
Ah, well then, see you later!
Okay!
Seems there'll be no more waves for today.
You know her?
That girl... is my hero
Have you eaten?
Open up!
Shut it off!
Where are you headed?
It's called "Sunrise Katamiya"
and then you'll see the school, so it's a right after that
Protective gear, check!
Minato-san, your Hero is at that building!
Any injuries?
Huh? No, I'm not sleepy at all...
Hinageshi, Minato
Ah!
Should I put on some music?
Full wet suit
Paddle paddle!
When you brew fresh grinds, it releases carbon dioxide
I'll be making egg salad sandwiches
It got me!
Good good! You can do it!
It's great they have enough fire extinguishers too
An old employee of mine opened a shop there
Catch some waves again...
Wanna come with us?
Quite aggressive too
Then I guess Youko would be a Blue-Ringed Octopus?
Small but has spit full of deadly tetrodotoxin!
I'm leaving!
That love is for stupid people like you!
Bye
That part about you really helps me out
And she wasn't going to school for a while
See?
Like this
It's still fi-
No problem!
I'm moving out of my parents place
But I couldn't do it no matter what I tried
And gradually started to find my current career path
I'm sure you'd be able to easily get over any hurdles, Minato
How long will I keep getting your help?
Until you'll be able to ride the waves yourself...
Ignoring me to keep surfing!
Are you okay?
Here's the stuff left at my brother's place
The hell are you doing crying in someone else's home
To pass away...
Sorry...
In fact it's better if you do!
Sorry...
You two are both so nice...
It's not someone's birthday...
Shall we try asking Wasabi?
Well, that's just fine in its own way
My brother's never gonna come back!
It's about time you face the facts already!
Why is he... inside the water?
I haven't been taking anything...
Can you see it? Minato in the water...
So his spirit comes out in water or something...?
Sure is
Haven't been surfing?
Yeah, I caught some glimpses of them
Petty!
Moving in together? Marriage?
Haha sorry!
Oh? Could this be jealousy?
One more
Oh, how greedy!
I'm good with you, Minato!
Welcome!
I wanted to talk to you about something
You're fine just doing things your own way, Wasabi!
You were following her the whole time?
Stupid Wasabi
So I got them in blue and white but...
Or that plastic finless porpoise
He's a good guy
Even I feel he's honest, and kind...
They won't all be good ones, so there will be farewells too
You'll never be able to ride them forward
Minato! He'll always be with me!
But...
I think even he wouldn't want for you to become like this!
Weren't you able to smoothly ride the waves all by yourself!
Hina...ko...
Because I kept asking for your help!
Our specialty is the many ways to enjoy our premium blend
That's amazing, Youko-chan!
No way!
What?
I decided to open a cafe
So I will realize that dream
Making it puff up
I still couldn't take it all back then
And I've yet to pay my respects...
You want to take a look right?
And he was absolutely horrible at first
Even after he became a firefighter
Was that when he was little and was saved from being drowned
Here it is!
I'm turning you on your side, bring your knees up!
The strawberries...
Are you interested in lifesaving?
The people who get qualified do all sorts of sports
And we participate in competitions as well
There's sugar over there
That took a huge burden off my shoulders
Can you hear me?
Put two hands together, and utilize your body weight to push
Check to make sure the chest rises when doing this
Amazing! Sounds awesome!
Ya'll on board? We going?
You won't be able to hear anything else!
Way to go!
Hello, Youko-chan...?
Illegal trespassing this time as well
What?
Ah, let's go!
Youko: I'm with Hinako...
The 252 in the upper floors has not been found!
The responsible parties include over 10 people, according to the source inside the building
Investigation ongoing!
...managed to ride my own wave...
It's just the two of them above here, leave it to me!
Right!
Here we go!
Ride your wave!
No problem, congratulations on being certified!
You know that girl?
That's my hero, out there.
I like the sea.
That's the one.
You'll see the school, after which you'll have to take the next right.
Fire! It's going up in flames!
Once fires 2 and 3 are out, confirm the safety of the 8th floor resident!
Of course.
No, thank you.
Go on, go on! You can do it!
Has Mr. Koba ever shown you his map?
He knows all the water systems and already learned all the shortcuts since he joined.
Only those with enough grit to push on through can ever reach that level.
Huh? That's strange.
I always wanted to come back though,
What?
just remember to get to your ground floor quickly if a fire breaks out.
Whatever you like.
The water I see you looking out on
I'll try harder...
Are you a superhero? Maybe Superman?
I was thinking when you rescued me from those flames,
And you can call me Minato, you know.
We'd better get going.
Oh, really?
A guy who used to work here has just opened a caf there.
He's got slightly more modern equipment there than this old place.
We're on our way to watch the fireworks.
How about joining us? I had to ask...
That being in love makes you act all stupid!
This blue-ringed octopus is so full of venom she needs to go home. Bye.
I just developed resistance to octopus venom, so no sweat.
No problem!
Do you wanna go up?
Shall we write one, too?
Let's see it, then.
MINATO HINAGESHI
Very nice, you two. What a cute couple.
They say if you manage to catch one your wish will come true.
The outside needs to be nicely cooked while keeping the inside soft and squishy.
See? Just like that.
I made sure I could eat while holding your hand.
I never want to let go of you whenever we're together.
I thought to myself that I wanted a job where I got to help people.
D'you want anything from this box?
Is that a finless porpoise?
Get somewhere with some signal, would you!
You said you'd be by my side forever, didn't you?
iMinato?i
Come on, you've gotta eat.
I'm so sorry!
Minato...
I wonder, if I sing that song...
You're not on drugs, right?
See! He's looking at us doing the Shaka sign!
Is it because you died at sea...
that you appear to me in water?
Let's not waste time on sad stuff.
But you can call on me whenever you need my help.
What're you going to get out of checking my phone, now?
I don't remember teaching my girlfriend to check people's phones as she pleases.
Are you okay?
Umm... Chiba.
I can't help you like that guy did earlier, either.
I'm not going to cheat, okay?
Nope.
I want to see you surfing again.
I should've thought more about your feelings before asking that of you.
I'm just one of those many waves.
You're not?
And walking hand-in-hand with Minato's old blow-up porpoise.
I'm not sure.
I didn't mean to bring that up, though!
You're the fireman I met that day?
But I didn't want to stop you.
New waves will always keep coming in.
Hinako!
And even as its colors change slowly,
Minato!
Minato, don't go! Hinako.
Hinako, please get a hold of yourself!
I don't want to say this, but Minato is gone!
He's not a ghost. You might not see him, Wasabi.
Minato said he'd be there, forever!
I know. But, I...
I'd bite you good and hard! What?
When I finish high school, I'll go get trained at the main branch, in Chigasaki.
At work.
So, I don't think they want any reminders of my brother...
Just a second...
Bring the nurse here when the ambulance arrives!
Training camps take place in summer while we keep watch over beach goers.
Hey!
It means I get a run out of it.
This is sickly sweet. No kidding.
I don't have Minato's taste buds either--
You're starting to sound like a broken record!
Yo...
But because of what you said, I figured that was okay.
My words did that...?
You can have the rest of the coffee, just bring the stuff back to the caf.
Give it your best, you big idiot!
No response. Next, check to see if they're breathing.
Remember to wait until the chest has risen before each compression.
Miss Mukaimizu?
I'm totally fried up! Don't you mean "fired up"?
Yoko. I'm going to call the cops.
We need proof first. I'm gonna take pictures of these jerks.
We'll set 'em off from right here. Boom!
Oh, no!
Shimmers ever so brilliantly in the light.
Minato...?
Left.
Omelet with rice and a lifeguard certificate...
there's a lovers' sanctuary you can visit.
That's Hinako.
WATER DRIP - PAPER DRIP NEL DRIP - FRENCH DRIP
MUKAIMIZU LANDSCAPING
I'm not going to get it for you, though.
Yeah. You've gotta get your calcium intake.
I just don't get it.
Who suggested we eat lunch on the roof?
But the weather's nice.
It'd be a waste to eat in the classroom.
It's a bigger waste if my food gets covered in sand.
Well,
By the way, Kaname-kun, Yuuki-kun...
Is that so?
I don't intentionally ignore anyone.
That's just who he is.
You used to be so much cuter.split this
Fine! I'll sleep in the middle!
Is that why you invited me over?
What now?
Oh yeah, that might've happened.
How about I sing you a lullaby?
You made Shun sleep in the middle,
Come on.
I will.
Let's get underway.
Go get the sweat, passion, and teamwork...
That's right.
What?
I thought he wanted something.
Yuuki-kun, do you want to check out the Tea Club?
I get it!
You don't want my indirect kiss?
What a creep.
No.
Kaname, you're paying for that.
This club will suit you perfectly!
You've been awfully hard on him today...
You get to sleep next to your beloved Kaori-sensei.
Kaname-kun, I didn't know you cared so much...
Please forgive him.
Who cares about that?
There's an 80 chance nothing will change, though,
Don't you have any spares?
Why don't you share with Yuuta, then? Just take alternate bites.
We got sidetracked, and I was famished.
He ended up going to the faculty office to get some disposable ones.
Then how about a magical spell to make the pain go away?
Hold on. Don't cry.
What's wrong, Shun?
A fortune? Lame.
This isn't what it looks like!
have any trouble harassing an upperclassman like that.
Okay.
We're gonna drag the culprit out here!
Come on!
A mannequin?
What bad luck.
Why are you nauseous?
The smell of make-up and perfume makes Yuuki-kun sick.
They're cute!
Okay.
Yuuta-kun...
Oh, that sounds good.
One time, I frantically removed the snow
"So itchy, so hot. They're on fire!"
Those tulips bloomed.
Okay.
A rock...
Could it be?
Yeah, only a little, right?
I just get so angry.
I'm sorry.
a little like this, curling under my finger.
And there's nothing to do during class, either.
Well, we did come all the way down here, after all.
That's right. This day will never come again.
H-Hey! Come on, Yukki! What was that for?
Next.
Shun-chan!
i1You're making it harder to take it.
It's getting cold up on the roof.
Yeah, from the convenience store.
I want to shine, as if I were reliving the festival!
You think I'd want to go to a movie with little boys who make a fuss over extra food?
That?
That's not what I meant.
What?
Um, I was wondering if I could have that...
Come on!
I'm the one who's embarrassed!
I don't need to buy bread every day,
You're into this sort of thing?
i1Guess not.
It's fine. No one will know.
You took the sticker off this bread, didn't you?
Hand it over.
Right...
It's fine! Just wave your delicious food in my face while you're eating it.
You're too nice to them.
I'm surprised you knew we'd be here.
That's okay.
Well, I'm the one who got it on you.
Someone I like?
Not at the moment, I guess.
Hey.
Don't push the crumbs from the table onto the floor!
The art's too cute!
I see.
No, we just eat dinner early.
Are you finished? Good work.
Pretty...
The next time I saw that hair was behind my eyelids.
Fine. I'll bring it.
It's just that Fuyuki and I mixed up our English notebooks.
But...
But now...
Here's your notebook.
Yuuki-kun, how exactly are these two alike?
School of insects?
No way.
Oh, the guy you're always talking about.
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Oh, yeah. I'm real healthy.
But Shun-nii, you don't have any.
Wait a minute. If he heard it from his friend, doesn't that mean his friend has...
Just because you know more than us and have a girlfriend...
Listen, you're only gonna look!
Hey, why don't you give it a go for old times' sake?
More like scary, with the way he's knocking them down left and right so indifferently.
My brother said he wanted to see the Kendo Club again.
I told you to just look!
Matsuoka?
Sure.
I don't have time for you guys.
And they say failure is the root of success.
What did you say?
It's nice to see you again, Sensei.
What?
Damn it. overlap
Hey, stop treating me like an insect!
Huh?
It's only slightly sprained.
It seems like... you've been taking good care of my brother lately, so...
That sounds like Matsuoka.
It jumps out of surprise...
Sorry. We did everything a couple of old men could do.
I'd beat the crap out of you if you weren't Shun-chan's brother!
M-Mamiya!
Yes.
About porn or upper arms!
You're right, Fuyuki.
i1He must hate me.
i1Matsuoka!
Huh?
You don't need to take me home.
You always get that, Chizuru.
100 fruit juice.
I haven't really looked at it yet, though.
You're right.
I wonder if Kaori-sensei's still there.
They might.
Outsiders will quietly observe from over here.
Your lip is sticking out even as you say that.
We were both excited and somehow apprehensive about visiting the kindergarten.
He's about to meet his beloved Kaori-sen
you understand what'll happen, don't you?
I'm just going to look around!
W-W-Wait!
And by that you mean you were hitting on her!
I need to go see the head teacher.
I think that would be a crime, age-wise.
The second son's here! Beep, beep!
There you go again, Ken-chan!
It's not so bad.
Three might be... too many.
Bathroom, bathroom...
I know. Maybe they're already the new generation.
You were?
I'm sure he really is a good kid.
Everything's a bed of roses to you.
Huh? It's got nothing to do with you, four-eyes.
You brat!
Sono-chan didn't hug you because she l-loves you.
i1Oh, right. I see.
What is that?
Just eat them!
Kaname-kun!
i1I'm sure he really is a good kid.
Don't dribble all over someone's shoes!
Okay.
Sorry.
Who's the boy standing behind you?
H-H-How'd you know?
Because I smelled something sweet.
Oh? What is it, Ken-chan?
See ya, four-eyes!
I wish we could play house with them again.
What do you want the guy with the glasses to be?
Huh?
Chizuru, you shouldn't laugh so much.
You have it all wrong! Kaname, you jerk! Four-eyes!
Okay.
I hope you'll share your textbook when I forget mine.
Aoto.
an8Hey, Tachibana-kun...
It's not so much "head-on" as from the right.
A clone?
There you are.
I'll ask Yukki, so don't sweat it.
Yukki?
Now, now...
You two must really be friends.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Hold up, Yu
He's not even a girl.
How dare you say that?!
He's not a girl.
Girls don't like overly persistent guys.
You are identical, but...
I do understand.
I can always buy manga volumes later,
I gave you one!
What? Then...
What do you want?
There sure are a lot of you against just one opponent.
Hey, wait!
i1Cool!
I guess he can't understand even if I apologize.
What does he want?
And I got you a gift.
I guess it did hurt, but I wouldn't have wanted you to apologize.
I heard she's good friends with all of you and usually comes up here, too!
I had to fill in the class register.
Yes?
Now that the rainy season has started, it rains quite a lot.
I'm Tachibana Chizuru!
I have a younger twin brother.
I'm a first year.
How about it, Yukki?
Let's see...
I dunno.
Yuuki-Mama! tilde can be deleted, but I feel like it fits XD
What are you guys doing?
And why are we having this mixer?
Huh?
Oh, Tsukahara-kun.
i1Now that you mention it, I guess I was pretty mature for my age, too.
Love is fleeting.
He believes he can solve any problem with money.
Yours is terrible.
Now you've done it!
Does he...
Don't worry about it.
I don't need your pity.
Jerk!
i1I hope...
Now, now.
Give you my phone?
That's nothing like him!
You're gonna drink in here, too?
What's with "annoying me"?
That's not something you should say to your son!
You have to remember the day...
Oh, Hisa-chan!
Kaname-kun, you should lie down.
I'm fine.
What's all that noise?
It wasn't my fault.
Actually, it'll be great going to school without you yelling at me.
Bye bye.
I don't hate the rain, though.
His notes are perfect!
It's here!
I guess.
I'm told you that I'm not interested in going out!
I'm busy!
Just one minute. Just talk to me for one minute.
Coming.
Yes.
It's deliciously sweet and light in my mouth!
What is this strange feeling? It's like I'm not really myself...
Now that we've come this far, we should finish making...
What?
She looks like a sheep.
Don't buy one. Our apartment doesn't allow pets.
"Something"?
Calm down!
Pass it around already!
Hey, Mary.
What's the matter? Are you boys rookies, too?
Sorry.
Hush.
Value is subjective.
His business is making a game of their lives.
I'm sure you did something to make him do that.
Doesn't she look like a sheep in a flock?
More importantly, we should help her.
Yeah.
It should be around here somewhere.
Seriously?
Why are you acting so tough?
You, too.
i1Shun-chan's coming back.
Should I take over?
Namu... Namu... Namu... Namu...
Here.
just like your life.
That looks fun.
I look forward to working with you.
Don't hold back.
It's best if you just disregard that.
Yuuki, you...
Hello.
You haven't looked like that since middle school.
I bet you were one cute middle-schooler, Shun-chan.
No!
I can't understand why you would ever put salt on something so delicious!
I feel like I'm smarter now!
Squeezing it stimulates your brain.
Why did you buy all this unnecessary stuff for studying?
i1Yeah, but...
He definitely has coke-bottle glasses.
Shall I take you on left-handed?
But thumb wrestling is fun!
That's right. Yuuki's really good at thumb wrestling.
Huh?
I'll never wear them in front of you guys.
If I win, you'll show us what you look like with your glasses on.
What are you doing?
Thumb wrestling?
See?
You piss me off way more than he does!
You think you can beat me while reading manga?
Just punish him!
It's gone way beyond thumb wrestling now.
Ow.
Apologize, first year.
I can't believe first years these days.
Me?
Is he in there? I can't see.
i1But...
Yuuta! Shun!
Can you call yourself Yuuki's...
One, two, three, four, five,
Kaname was so worried about
Don't say it!
Are you sure Yuuta came down here?
Yuuta...
What?
Yuuta's coming over here.
an8Three losses in a row!
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot...
Maybe having all these guys around without a girl in sight is making it feel even hotter.
We should have one or two...
"If it's our preference," you say...
Could any of you have taken my dictionary out of my locker?
I might as well ask since I have the opportunity.
I feel like juice tastes different from a cup than from a carton.
Who would ever turn down a girl who confessed to you?
They must be meeting up somewhere.
Roger.
Now, let's...
Sorry. I'm just so young and eager.
What are we gonna do? We lost them.
I think they probably went down those stairs.
From here? Probably...
i1When he asked if I wanted to go somewhere...
You shouldn't do that, Shun-chan.
I end up reading all day when we don't have school.
I don't really do anything.
We can throw a paper cup phone in...
How long have you been there?
You should at least walk her home!
Are you okay?
You're...?
Did you just look at your phones the whole time?
By the way, I started playing Taiko drums recently.
Th-Thanks.
Hurry up!
A-Are there any songs on it you would recommend?
There's a crack in it.
That's not what I meant.
I'm sure he'll say yes. You're really cute!
If you don't dislike them, you should stay with them.
Really?
I feel like juice tastes different from a cup than from a carton.
What? B-But why?
Yes.
Ah, I'll do it!
What should it be about?
A hero...
Yukki will be second!
His costume and sword are awesome!
I simplified it and ended up with this.
They couldn't be more mismatched.
I'm done with the third page!
She probably spotted his sword with those huge eyes of hers.
It's finally my turn, isn't it?
This is the bittersweetness of our...
Oh, really?
But the friendship, hard work, and conflict...
This hero's hair looks just like someone else's.
I just figured we might have made something you're not happy with.
You want me to draw a manga?
This might actually sell.
Probably a sports story.
The protagonist will join the Basketball Club,
All right! I'm going make a manga for the club about Yuuki-senpai.
I wonder what I should write. A hero is...
The five of them pose together, and...
Why are you the only one wearing your school uniform?
Th-This is getting really embarrassing!
All right, everyone!
Hold it right there.
Yuuta-senpai's so great, but Yuuki-senpai has like, a dark side.
His lone wolf attitude is so cool.
Yes!
Yuuki's not that kind of person.
Don't touch my girl.
No!
There's an anime at five I want to watch.
I'm hiding from him.
But I still think he's greater than any hero.
Let me see your manga when you're done with it, Matsushita-kun.
Hey, for today...
the cultural festival budget for our class.
We're doing a caf with a twist.
and trouble.
Well, I'll see if we can shift some money from somewhere else.
Hey, Yuuki and that monkeyI mean, Tachibana... where'd they go?
All right then, your big brother will ride it.
But it feels more like I'm trapped in a box...
Straying off the beaten path is our motto.
Roger.
Curve!
I've never been able to deal with it very well.
Yeah!
You're just using the copier for the first time.
It's my first time, too.
Starting copying.
I think it's trying to throw us off by not spitting out copies easily. by not easily churning out copies
What is this?
Hey, stop! Stop!
Kaname, aren't you coming?
Um...
I said I wanted to work at reception during the festival,
Hey, you guys look rather fetching.
Just flip it up already!
You've been awfully cranky lately.
You'll have to change it into something simple to prepare, or...
We're almost done with props...
Oh, thanks a lot, man!
I see.
Yeah, you're so unreliable.
a6Don't fight before the festival.
2117 grams over!
I don't think we're anywhere near the mark.
Something's been off since the beginning of the second semester.
for giving salt to his enemy's generals?
You didn't get a single question right.
Hey, come on! Everyone's got their eye on Hanako-chan today! i edited this alot to incorporate hte reference to gegege no kitaro
Hanako-san, a woman's hair is her life.
i1We're opening the haunted house for business.
Why aren't you wearing your vest?
What? Why'd you slap me?
Here we go.
Hey, aren't you in the Student Council?
Yakisoba and chocolate covered bananas are the best part of a festival.
Excuse me!
Of course.
But really, you two look so cute!
You're surprisingly level-headed.
What are you reading?
You're bleeding.
I'm sure if you check with the festival committee, they'll understand.
If I were your underclassman, I know I'd rely on you.
What's with you guys?
Let's hurry to Masaki-chan's play!
Huh? Just go if you want to go.
In fact, it'll be enough if only you go...
I haven't seen you since the fireworks.
Way to go, Cinderella!
This brings back memories. It still smells the same.
He probably thought you were his age.
I'll have to talk to him later.
So this is what the girls' bathroom looks like.
Ow! Why are you so violent?
Shun-chan knows, too.
He knows!
If I had the energy to go to the dance tonight, I'd go home.
Jump!
I'm not afraid of problems
Always seems to shine out next to me
This is your room.
I will.
She looks like this doll...
Oh, um...
Alice, she wants to be your friend.
I'm Oomiya Shinobu.
Japanese girls are so scary!
i1While the Japanese girl is at the homestay,
Come here!
I'll go heat up some milk.
It's very warm.
There.
You're supposed to put it in your hair and turn it.
Wow!
Alice, how is the bath?
This smells like Japan.
Hello.
Shinobu, wake up.
See you later.
Good morning.
So, anyway...
Yeah.
Alice?
It's good to see you again.
Yeah, I came to see you.
I wrote about it in my letter.
Aya.
I know what you mean.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you going to live while you're in Japan?
I'm a little shocked.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to endure it if it's so painful!
I have a foreign style room.
No.
Everything was western.
an1It is time to open them
an3Ooh, yay!
Even if we fail, with you here
Please gimme your voice! The fact that
i1Japan is a very easy place to live in.
Don't water the plants.
What beautiful white skin you have.
Yeah, in the afternoon.
Hm, I'm sure I...
Yeah, I did...
i1I plan to enjoy my Japanese high school life to the fullest again today!
It was only a joke!
Hello, hello.
She spoke in English!
i1How did this happen?
Shino...
i1That's it.
I will call Shinobu "Shino"!
I'm so happy.
What does "moe" mean?
What the heck is that?!
Over-generalisation!
Hm?
Are they travelling?
They seem to be having trouble.
Goodbye.
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair when I graduate.
It might actually look good on you, though.
If I dyed my hair blonde,
i1She looks sleepy now...
I've never thought about what I want to do in the future.
but I'd like to become someone who helps others.
Well...
Yes, all finished.
Try translating Alice's English, then.
Uh-oh.
She's so small, but she's living in a foreign country all by herself.
Allow me to answer!
Your handwriting is beautiful, Alice-san.
i1Alice, how old will you be on your birthday this year?
Oh, you're back.
We're all going to the pet shop again...
Is that really enough of a reason?
It's a vapour trail.
C'mon, read the mood here!
There are so many colours.
It sounds like fun!
Filled with a lot of love
Good morning.
Don't act like I don't usually wear them!
If you don't get cold easily, you won't catch colds even in winter.
It sounds convincing coming from you, since you're always healthy.
I'm so excited for Christmas!
In my house, we go to church every year and spend it together as a family.
Sorry for making light of it.
I already asked for mine.
I have a feeling it's something way out there.
No, I'm asking for more of a "hyper love".
Alice.
Like that?
Lookie, lookie.
Thank you.
You've been listening to that non-stop, Alice.
Do you remember your first dream of the new year?
What's wrong?
You seem down.
I'll change later.
What's wrong, Alice?
Alice lost her memory and forgot how to speak Japanese!
The wind through London Bridge during winter was cold.
You're just teasing us, aren't you?
Um...
It is very difficult to find such a fluffy yet sticky taste from other dishes.
That's nothing new...That's not really news...or "That's obvious"
I see.
Cheating is very bad.
I will do my best to translate!
That's the spirit!
I don't understand any of it.
I was the one who thought you didn't like me anymore.
It's to protect myself from the omen.
What?
There's nothing wrong
The bright morning sun shines on the beginning of a new day
Yay! Yay! It will surely be all right
I'm so excited for all the new things in the new year.
Split up?
Looks like it's a classroom wall separating us.
i1Gloom...
It's the distance between Japan...
That's not bad.
i1They say rabbits die of loneliness, but I wonder if it's true.
I'm glad we're in the same class.
i1The damage is even worse than I thought.
That would really make the class shine.
Sparkle, sparkle!
Bow.
I'll go with you.
I'm so jealous.
Class A's homeroom teacher is wonderful, too.
Sunny days make me feel so energetic!
The protagonist of this manga is so cool.
Thanks for waiting!
We're high school first years, though.but they just became second-years!-mogunote: it's NOT a mistranslation, they actually cut back in time suddenly between scenes for some weird and confusing reason
Miss, your shoulders are so stiff.
I will read aloud to you.
This is difficult, isn't it?
Could it be?
That might work.
You're so mean!
Oh, Momotaro.
No!
What are you talking about?
I thought of something.
The models for the princesses are me and Alice.
Yes, it's my treasure.
Men, set sail!
Shino!
Shino...
Alice.
Maybe I can find it if I'm with you.
You can call me Shino.
I guess Aya would be a mermaid.
What?
I have always longed to see you again.
You are, aren't you?
I've thought of you all this time.
Give Shino back!
Karen.
Yes!
Humans are such fools.
And so, the princess lost her golden hair,
What's going on?
We're going to begin our morning announcements.
They can see each other any time, and they'll always be friends.
You're right.
Yeah.
The nameless flower blooming by the path is something amazing
K-Konnichiwa. blue "Hello"?
She's a bit shy.
It's fine.
Oh, right!
This is your room.
Is there anything else you'd like to know?
What's that?
Oo... mi?
I hope you're good with unfamiliar foods. foreign?
I know! While the Japanese girl's at my house, why don't you live with me and be my little sister? Did she just turn full cockney?
Besides, I'll be travelling tomorrow. travelling because she's British
Yay! Good boy, Poppy!
No, it wasn't her fault.
This smells like Japan... Smells like Japan...
Hello!
an8Oh, and there's also Youko-chan...
I'll send you the picture.
Hello!
Finally.
Probably.
Sorry, I'll be right back!
Okay!
Oomiya-san, you're cheerful as usual.
I transferred from a school in England.
She just realized?
That was a joke! Please laugh!
"Ino" as in boar, and "kuma" as in bear!
Why are you talking like that!?
That hairpin is really cute.
I wanted to make it a surprise.
Oomiya Shinobu.
We're off!
Good morning!
Aya-chan, you forgot to put on your tights!
Then you won't have any!
Youko is bright and cheerful.
Why?
I'm sorry they're so small! am I hearing this rightthink so
I want to be just like her when I grow up!
Oh my, thank you.
Alice-san.
I do!
I wonder who thought of it.
I've been here for a whole hour!
The correct answer was "foreigner"!
I'm going to do something!
Alice!
Why'd she go in the first place?
Maybe she'll learn to speak proper English one day.
I like England and France...
Are you dying it blonde?
Shino, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Those clothes you wore yesterday looked great on you!
No one could look as cute in those clothes as you, Shino!
No!
What is it, Oomiya-san?
Can I see that?
Interpreter!
Oh, you mean for aliens.
They've got a long way to go.
What if...
Ouch!
I'll pick that up for you!
Let me answer for her!
Which is better?
Why... What the fuck?
Alice, how old are you going to be this year?
Shino!
But either way, you're a very precious friend.
About what?
Look, contrails. there's no common word for this, is there?I like contrail
Judging from the direction it's flying.
Alice-san.
You got a hundred. I think I'd actually say "you got an a hundred"
treats me like a little kid.
Ah!
I started to miss it.
I can be your mother's replacement from now on!
Really? That's the first time someone's said that to me.
If I became friends with her...
S-Sorry.
England lies at the other end of that rainbow!
How poetic.
I feel like I've been seeing a lot of foreigners lately.
Maybe you've just been noticing them more because of Alice.
and she had silky blonde hair
Yeah,
She's Alice's friend from the pictures.
Let's go see her later.
there are a lot of people with names that make sense both in Japan and abroad.
You were named with the hopes that you'd be as small and cute as a squirrel, right?
Ayaya?
Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya!
Please call me Shino.
Really?
See you tomorrow!
Karen!
Japan is so cool!
That's common sense.
You're only a half, but you've got the aura of a full foreigner. "going full foreigner" in Starcraft, incidentally, means "losing a game that you had a huge lead in"
Shino, I'm not sure about that metaphor.
Sorry I couldn't help.
Such carefree smiles... ugh
We've lost! really?
I ended up sleeping twelve hours! maybe eight years ago this could have been "I accidentally twelve whole hours!"
Huh? added
Karen-san, let's be friends!
Karen's always been bold and straightfoward.
I know, I know.
You went by yourself?!
How adultlike.
Even I only go to fast food places alone!
Shino,
so I'll sing you a song.
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...
an8Happy birthday to you...
With the way she's so docile...
Huh, what?
It was pretty mean of her to suggest a bonsai.
I want one!
Alice, you're bursting with it!
Like a high school girl!
I wanna see it!
Shino, sit there.
What is it?
Isn't that what gravure is?
My sister is a fashion model.
Don't worry. Just the thought is enough.
I saw it and thought you'd like it.
It must be because of how small you are.
What are you saying?
No, you're the younger one, Alice.
Older.
Older!
Hmm.
Hey! Alice, wait!
nom
In English, both older and younger sisters are just called "sisters", right?
I don't care what you say. I'm still the older sister.
Alice, help me study!
I got carried away.
What's with this tempest?oh yeah?
She's in the eye of the storm!
Shino...
Best friends forever!
And I really really really love Shino!
Is this the mythical foreign skinship?!
Come of think of it, I had something to tell Alice.
I might forget what I wanted to say, though.
Aya! You'll never believe this! or, the literal translation
Oh, you're right.
I'll be sure to read it in secret later.
I must know. I must know. I must know. I must know. I must know!
It shows I'm delicate!
Th-Thank you.
Aya, let's go home.
What did you say?
G-Good morning!
Yeah, it went fine.
They're just too good.
That's because we've known each other so long.
That's not what that's for!
Though the story ended up being about Isa-nee somehow.
an8Hot...
I see.
Hey there, Isa-nee.
Whoa, awesome!
Did you make these yourself?
So why are you beaming?
Isami!
Is she used to things yet?
but recently, perhaps because she's found something she really cares about,
Where did Youko go?
There!
You okay there, Karen?
You always stand back with a smile,
but you really listen to what we all have to say.
Put on a mask, at least.
What are you drawing?
Here we have the revised edition.
What are you saying...
By the way, I made one for you too, Ayaya.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Speaking of which,
so I've always wanted a big sister!
I don't need you to hold my hand everywhere I go, Youko!
Did something happen?
Every since we started high school, especially once Alice and Karen arrived,
Me too.
Like if she got stranded in the middle of a desert,
Yeah, I do.
Then... can I call you Isa-nee?
She told me they approached her right around here.
I think you'd look cute.
Alice.
Alice.
Let's go to the beach!
Places you want to go in the summer!
Beach!
What?
They're really a pain, you know. of the "in the ass" type
Summer vacation.
It's a mountain!
You're trying to cool the air.
It'll be a big accomplishment if we make it all the way up.
We had fish for lunch every day!
I hope I catch a big one!
I have to show Shino how great I am!
I can't lose to Karen.
I've been good at fishing ever since I was young.
Alice?
You're right!
What do you mean by that?
My mom!
Tastes like mom's cooking!
There are a lot of bugs.
Come on, Aya!
Shino!
Sorry, everyone.
But my clothes are dry clean only... some liberties here
What should I do?
I just couldn't!
Take a look at this.
That's only at the Aomori Festival.
Well...
Making stuff up again...
Are you lost, Karasu-chan?
Then why do you have three of those?
Well...
You too, Alice.
Hey!
I lost!
Why don't you go too?
Huh?
One, two, and three!
One, two, and three!
There!
One, two, and three!
Since I was waiting at the station.
It only stings because you left it.
What did you buy? have you eyes, Alice?it's dark. also, they aren't round in England
Shino,
How was it?
It's over.
Don't come this way!
It's August 31st already.
I can't sing. I can't sing. I can't sing.
The Ayaya!
We'll bring happiness to the world! a world, which, by the way, contains more than just your country, Shino...
Spare me!
I'll take soprano. or "do the soprano part"
Blonde!
Is something happening? ...
My tracksuit.
Alice, don't worry!
It's like wearing just a long shirt. the style girls usually do with leggings
A thousand meters?
They're even slower!
Hmm, you're right.
That's it!
Repeat after me!
It'd be the perfect chance to spout a one-liner! eurghurgh
Oh yeah, Karen. You always come late, don't you?
What do you do before?
So you got all these from other people?
Karen, wear this.
That sounds easy enough.
Girls are better when they're a little on the chubby side.
Anyway, we need to know how much we weigh before we do anything.
That's right. It's the clothes.
And don't strip! didn't you want Aya to strip a few episode ago?
Oh, my weight hasn't changed.
You should follow everyone's example.
Huh?
Alice!
If you don't back down...
My class is putting on a play!
Yes?
We'll leave the tea choice up to you.
Gotcha.
Cooking chocolate.
Rice flour.shiratamako
Does tofu even count as a snack?
Welcome back!
The preparations got really hectic,
I'm talking about something else.
Something else?
Um... uh...
What's wrong, Alice?
You look like an octopus.
Sorry.
It's okay!
I know! Hit me as hard as you can!
Aya-chan, it looks great on you!
Japanese so hard, yes?
W-Welcome!
Who could have done such a thing?
Huh?
Isami!
Isami!
Don't you two think your choice of outfits is backwards?
Capture my brilliance with your camera!
The actress aura is back!
I know, right?
That's so clich! or add your special 'e' or whatever
She likes anything with romance in it.
Shino!
P-Please...
Shino, when you came to my house, ???
I hope you like it.
Wow, what a cute ribbon!
How does it look?
It fits you perfectly!
What's that on your head?
I see.
We're going to meet Karen at her house and then go over to Aya's together.
She lives in this apartment building.
Boiled eggs are the ones you can crack on your head, not raw ones.
I want to take a bubble bath!
Sorry, we don't have that.
That might be a little...
"Blonde Girls in the Bath" sounds like the name of a painting! okay, not really, but woinjfoernvk
Must be Ayaya's.
I'm gonna borrow a bit!
You're so mean! You knew, didn't you?
You said that you felt like you were forgetting something a while ago.
It reminded me of when you came to my house!
Please take me as your disciple!
Sounds like fun!
Now then.
Huh?
I can't be like you just by wearing this.
I... am understand.
Oh! My! God!
It's just your imagination.
Kick it with your foot!
Karen's really good at sports-like activities. competitionsphysical activities?
I guess I'll never be like Karen.
Aya-chan?
R-Really?
Was that it?
Thank you!
Ayaya still has quite a ways to go.
an8Five...
i1Behold the power of Karen, the hide-and-seek master!
Karen, you're wasting your breath. it is for HnS, I think
You're so cute, Alice!
See you tomorrow.
Me?
Everything is pretty, pretty good
The small puddles and the things you worry about today
Jump!
an3Ooh, yay!
Oomiya-san.
Here!
Even though you're so bad at English, you work hard to achieve your dreams.
Okay.
I can't do it!
And then, Shino said that this was hard to understand...
Wa!
Huh?
I-It's a secret!
Karasuma-sensei's nickname is Karasu-chan.
"Shino" comes from shortening "Shinobu".
Thank goodness. arueghivs
She was as cute as you, so I just kinda named her after...
Um, wait, why are you looking at me like that? I don't mind yours though
No!
Good for you, Shino!
What's wrong, Alice?
Maybe if I stay really close to someone with good luck...
Shino!!
Don't tell me my bad luck rubbed off on Shino!
You have wonderful students, Sensei.
Yes!
I want to bat.
Hooray! Hooray!
Knock what out?
Cheer!
How is that different from what Shino's doing?
It's this one!
Japan's anime and manga culture is wonderful! aruhgdirnwe
It's really helped me learn Japanese!
Wonder what she's reading.
I think these clothes would look good on you, Youko.
I wonder about that.
Thank you!
And wasn't yours O?
I'm an A as well.
Shino always gets up late on our days off.
Hey, Shinobu...
A hundred thousand yen?
Meow, meow!
Gotcha!
Ah, Shino!
Be nice to it, okay?
Alright! See you!
Um...
So we're not related by blood?
Come on, get over it already. this sounds too mean...
Cake!
Fancy seeing you here.
Fly away, ball...
Karasuma-sensei, what's wrong?
Maybe.
We'll see.
We wanted to celebrate with everyone.
It'll be at my house.
Even Youko gets cold.
What's Christmas like in England?
Get in the holiday spirit!
Besides, the merriest of them all
I'm especially happy that you'll be here to celebrate it with us this year.
Christmas is all about the presents!
love!
What, really?
Call her out on her lie!
Wow, Sensei!
You're attending Christmas mass! according to Matt
Our neighborhood is famous for the decorations we put up on Christmas.
Aren't they pretty?
It's not that complicated...
Impressive!
Oh, yeah!
I can't imagine that at all!
Shino!
Huh?
Do you remember your first dream of the year?
Really?
I'm surprised they haven't found you yet.
In my dream, something crazy happened to Alice!
This is way beyond what we learn in class!
Say my name, at least!
Alice, how many mochi would you like in your soup?
Hello.
and I always have it with honey.
yet sticky taste from other dishes.
True.
No...
It wards away bad omens.
Ayaya, you always say "Youko, Youko", don't you?
This time of year always gets you all sentimental.
Though we've still got a long way to go.
Karen, you shouldn't run like that.
We're all going to be Onee-sans soon.
Morning...
Isn't that a bit...
So that means I'm your little sister, right?
I'm a second-year now!
She's been like this all morning.
Ayaya, you too!
They say that rabbits can die of loneliness,
Today felt so long even though it was only the opening ceremony.
Remember back to our days as first-years!
I never felt lonely!
Morning, Alice-chan.
Lovely weather, isn't it?
Clear skies get you so pumped up!
Karen, you're going to be late if you don't hurry up. though I think she skips like half the words
What happened to you?!
When this left eye tingles, the world will meet its end.
Oh, this is from when I fell yesterday.
That's so misleading!
I understand how reading a story can influence your life.
Like this.
You're really tensed up, Miss.
It's like some sort of code. I can't actually hear what she's sayingmarude angou no you
Why don't we write a story we can read together?
Like, let's see...
That's so mean!
Fantasizing?
He's on a donkey.
Fantasies, huh?
I'll get to you.
What is your treasure?
Shino!
A world never seen before...
Shino!
"A letter to my best friend."
You'll be okay.
That ship!
You must love him.
...important to me?
Coming through!
Class is starting soon.
Huh? That story took place in the present?
I'll pray every day for your safe return.
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
She's a shy girl.
We eat dinner at seven.
Hello.
Alice!
My older sister picked it out.
Turn.
Shinobu, are you good at baking?
She wants to know if you're really Japanese.
Japan?
a6Oh, Aya-chan is my friend from school.
I hope I go visit Japan someday.
I'll send you pictures.
Hello!
Shinobu, wake up. You're going to be late.
Shino, you're late.
Sorry, I was reading a letter.
Probably.
Your school... so happy... uniform...
Happy uniform?
That girl was wearing one of our uniforms.
Good morning.
I know what you mean.
Nice to meet you.
I don't taste very good.
Where are you going to live while you're in Japan?
We don't have much, though!
My mom kept your visit secret from me.
I'm sorry.
I believed I could
Oh, I have something for you.
I've gotten pretty used to living here.
What beautiful white skin you have.
Sort of like these two!
Mornin'.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about!
I'm 155 centimeters tall, so...
Don't worry. You'll grow taller.
Maybe you won't...
Shinobu, you like English?
I want to be like her when I grow up.
Why, thank you.
Impressive, Alice-san.
Sensei was so happy.
Oh, it's Sensei!
All their faces layer together...
They're late...
What if they got into an accident on the way?
Shino's dressed up as someone.
A gothic lolita?
What? Europe... England...
Sensei, goodbye.
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair when I graduate.
Aya, don't tell me you really believe that!
So like her!
Shino, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Really?
It did?
Why don't you look at Shino's face to calm you down?
is trying not to get too sleepy.
I've never thought about what I want to do in the future.
Don't worry about it too much.
I don't have a clear plan,
but I'd like to become someone who helps others.
Someone
That was quick.
Oh, come on! What am I supposed to write, then?!
What do I do? I don't know how to respond...
No, she's looking in the direction of...
Friends?
I don't know what to say to such a sudden confession.
Disappointment
Yes.
Is that really enough of a reason?
Yes.
Look at this.
I hear black hair is pretty popular among foreigners.
I can't believe Alice has a friend back in England.
Her father is Japanese, and she taught me how to speak the language.
She's back to her usual self.
I met a blonde girl around here the other day.
Alice said she was half-Japanese, right?
Zoom, zoom!
Japan?
I know. Why don't we all go live in Japan for a while?
Karen, your Japanese has improved.
Karen
But you have many strengths of your own, Alice.
Alice? Karen?
Karen, I'm sorry for coming to Japan without telling you.
So cool.
You only just transfered here, after all.
Y-Yeah.
Please give me advice on making friends with my classmates.
Let me show you around the school. Let's go.
D-Don't go out of your way for me.
Are you free today?
U-Um, well...
They're good friends.
We lost.
Hey, I was first.
You seem so gentle and approachable. I envy you.
Your smile is wonderful, Karen.
a6Really? Let's go somewhere on the way home, then.
I feel a little better now.
Karen-chan, let's be friends.
Maybe we don't speak the same language,
But that's what I like about you.
A Japanese smell...
You smell like a dresser, too!
a64 Aya Nervous in the Rain
Hey, g'mo'ning!
Karen-chan, g'mo'ning.
What's going on?
It's today, right?
Birthday, you, Shino.
Like a high school student.
Yoko, how could you say that?
No!
Darn?
Grr Grr
Yeah.
But if you insist on giving me something, I'd take a strand of your hair.
If we gave Shino a computer...
She knows exactly how to handle her.
Now you can get it.
The third from the right.
I can get it myself.
In English, both older and younger sisters are just called "sisters."
What? Um...
Alice, are you still upset about this morning?
Karen, I know you followed Alice to Japan,
We are forever best friends.
Here.
And she's so close.
I know! I'll write it down.
Make sure you say hello to Matsuki-san from next door if you run into her.
Aya, what do we do?! Listen to this!
What does "popular" mean?
You must burn that letter immediately.
Aya, don't.
Stare...
Hurry up and look at it!
You're not the ladylike type.
What?
"Alice is so energetic and small."
Oh, my. Yoko-chan, did it excite you?
Goodbye! Goodbye!
How's your head feeling?
Shino and I have been friends since elementary school.
Kiwis are so cool, aren't they?
While she's at school,
I'll come running.
I feel like that turned into a story about Isa-nee somewhere along the way...
I see. Yoko, you definitely do...
Aya-chan.
You don't have to keep repeating it!
Really? I don't look at fashion magazines much.
Sure, but it'll cost you.
Give me one of your treasured possessions or something.
How is it?
It doesn't have much flavor.
Can't you be a bit more sensitive?!
Of course they do.
It's my friend calling.
Really?
No way!
Let's stand a little farther back.
Okay.
Thank you for today.
and I was always worried about her...
I haven't seen you like this since the entrance ceremony.
Where is Yoko?
Ready... go!
but they're my treasure.
Let's try expressing it using a pie chart.
Stare...
After observing you today, I realized that this graph was incorrect.
That is why I've made this revised version.
As you can see, half of you is made up of kindness.
Aya's pie chart? Let me see.
You think so?
I'm an only child, too.
Onii-chan?
I'm not in elementary school.
12:55.
She was scouted right around here.
More than a maid outfit?
That would just make me a wooden doll!
Rabbits.
Shino.
Yamanote Line game! Places we want to go in summer!
The beach!
The mountains!
Clench
Just so you know, I'm an average size.
Don't worry about that.
What are you talking about? Are you okay?
I don't want to see a fairy in so much pain.
She should be coming with her father.
I need to show Shino how great I am.
I caught another one.
I've been good at fishing ever since I was little.
You want to swim that badly?
There!
Shino, I found a crab.
Just... wait there...
How nice.
Shino, you really like blonde hair, don't you?
How about this one?
Me neither.
What?
an8 Oh, Magistrate, you and your antics!
Oh, hello, girls.
and seeing what we want to eat and do.
What?
I'm fine.
Now that that's over with, let's go.
I want this.
I did it.
They do whatever they please.
There isn't a fireworks display.
Aren't you going to light a sparkler?
It's the most fun I've ever had, too.
Only the sound of the clock echoed through the room.
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
It's already August 31st.
There's nothing wrong
Ooh Yeah!
Jump!
And having big dreams
Is a small bit of happiness
Just for you, my love
What's wrong, Alice?
You seem down.
Woof!
I'm fine now.
What's she like?
The rain's stopped.
Maybe.
Alice said she was half-Japanese, right?
i1Dad, what's Japan like?
Huh?
N-No, I'm not at all.
Alice, I'm here!
Ayaya?
P-Please stop...
Shino, are you a ninja?
You want me to do what?!
But you have many strengths of your own, Alice.
There was something that kept bugging me.
See you later.
Japanese people just wave when they say goodbye!
They sometimes speak to each other in English.
There's something different about the two of them.
Cool.
to read the situation.
i1The teacher gave me a map of the school.
The old wound...
It's true.
You still aren't getting along with your classmates.
but I get the feeling you're special, Shino.
Hey, Karen, why don't you join a club?
Really?
I feel a little better now.
Yeah, she sure is.
I can't wait to be your friend.
I wonder if I would have made friends with everyone right away, like Karen.
My...
Show a little interest!
Take the bait!
One ramen coming up!
There's some kind of dark aura...
We gazed upon the round snow globe together.
Karen, you were so good.
Lyrics: RUCCA Score: Anzai Takaharu Song: Uesugi Hiroshi
Shino, don't interrupt them!
when autumn comes, I can finally...
I put it somewhere I'd see it,
You're pretty scatterbrained, huh?
It's all right. The design hasn't changed much.
But, Sensei...
It's okay, you don't need any.
C-Come to think of it, where are Shino and Alice?
you'll tire less if you run at your own pace.
She's trying to tell us something in English.
Yeah, more or less.
Answer the question!
Can I have a piece of fried chicken?
Lunch time! Lunch time!
Thank you.
Hey! Your broken Japanese sounds suspiciously fake.
Maybe someone can give us some ideas...
But your butt's a bit on the big side, Sensei.
Hey, Karen, that was rude.
That's pointless!
You can whisper it to me.
You really shouldn't.
I'd like to eat a packed lunch made by you, too.
I'll be fine.
This'll be fine...
Rice.
I think of the arts.
What?
The quiet classrooms, the scratching of pens.
Faculty Office
Good morning, everyone.
Are you okay?
I studied at home,
That's why I decided to look inside your mind for the answers!
Don't pay attention to her. I need to focus.
That sound...
It's almost time for the school festival.
Our class is going to run a caf.
That has nothing to do with this!
Is this really such a serious issue?
Why not combine the two, then?
How about we do this?
Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho!
I don't want a caf like that...
My class is putting on a play.
Amazing.
That was a joke?
Is it that unusual?
To buy materials.
Baking chocolate, canned red beans, rice flour...
I'm just picking up some snacks.
Komichi-san.
Can you try on your outfit to see if it fits?
Huh? But...
I think it'll look great on you.
No.
What's wrong, Alice? You look like an octopus.
The shock may help me remember!
And then Shinobu...
What about an Academy Award anniversary?
You're right.
They're members of the public.
What kind of sound effect is that?
I think you'd be good with the customers, Karen.
There they are.
You look cute in traditional Japanese clothes, Alice.
What a clich.
Snow White...
Kinda sad, isn't it?
Shi...
What? That's terrifying!
I hope you like it.
Thanks for waiting.
The new brand of instant noodles I had last week was delicious,
so I might make that my ramen...
You don't really need a dictionary, do you?
It must be this apartment building.
I mean, I wasn't worried at all!
The convenience store was packed.
You got it!
Now, then...
Doing it by eye works fine for this stuff.
Hey, Alice, Karen... Have you broken those eggs?
Bubbles? I'm sorry, but I don't have any of that.
Oh, I do have scented bath powder, though.
How?!
I'll just borrow a little.
Good morning.
Is she a foreigner?
Sure. I'd like to visit your place.
Karen... No, Master! Make me your apprentice!
I can't copy that.
I-I need to talk to you!
Okay.
Listen, Yoko...
Really?
Let's make up by buying matching notebooks.
You can hide anywhere in the school.
Huh?!
There doesn't seem to be anyone in here.
Alice-san? What happened?!
Culprit
She's not here.
Alice-san, save yourself!
B-But...
It's nice every once in a while.
Alice, what's tag called in English?
See you next time.
But I think Komichi-san knows the answer.
What? Sure. Go ahead.
Yes, I understand now.
What? Oh, um... it's...
Why?
It'd be nice if you had a nickname that was easier to say.
Oh, Karasumi!
I never said you could call me Ayaya.
Ka... Kare... Kare...
Yes?
How cute.
She looks exactly like she does now, though.
Congratulations, all of you Geminis!
Hello
Oops, we got the wrong person?
I-I won't let this get me down.
Yes.
I borrowed some equipment from my father.
Okay!
Hit it out of the park, Yoko!
What?
You can do it, Alice.
The side you hold your bowl on.
I don't have the heart to tell them it was a foul ball.
A new volume of the manga I like came out.
It's a foreign girl.
Hey, Isa-nee's in here.
I bet these clothes would look good on you.
Your lucky color is orange.
So am I.
What does that mean?
Elizabeth is the name of a doll I saw in a store.
If Alice were on sale in a store, how much would you pay for her?
What do you mean?!
I will. See you.
Well, whatever.
Inokuma Yoko
Y-Yoko? It's me, A-Ayayayaya.
I'll hand the phone to...
Let's hang out together next time, okay?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
A Spectacle of Love and Tears
What?!
Speaking from experience, you can get used to the cold.
I'm so excited for Christmas!
That's you!
No, I'm asking for more of a "hyper love."
I've never seen that happen!
Aya'd look great in one, but she refuses to wear it.
But the rule of a Japanese Christmas is to spend it with you.
Later.
We might have one, too.
Celebrating with your family sounds so English.
It's my greatest treasure.
What should I do? I don't want it.
You've been listening to that nonstop, Alice.
What's wrong?
That's probably not me...
You can't wear a kimono to school, Karen.
I'll change later.
Speaking of first dreams, I had one, too.
but I can't talk to her like this.
Hello.
So, she's now into a more British girl.
Shino, this must a trial that has been imposed on you.
A trial?
That's the spirit!
You shouldn't step on the threshold.
And then, the incident occurred...
I look forward to another year with you, Shino.
Yes. By the way, Alice...
As soon as I woke up, I sent a picture of a treasure boat down a river!
a6How fast time flies, I can't believe
How fast time flies...
Good morning, Mom.
Good morning, Shino.
Daughter
Hey, Sis... I achieved a perfect score on my most recent test.
Wow, that's amazing.
The new school year starts today.
Good mornin'!
She's been like this all morning.
There's nothing you can do.
I'm going to lie down.
Get a grip!
I can't believe how difficult they're being.
Did she want to be in Alice's class that badly?
the new school year is finally beginning.
You can ask me for anything!
That would mean two blondes in one class.
Stand.
Compared to that, this is nothing.
Thanks for waiting!
What happened to you?!
Good mornin'!
Good morning. Uh, do you have a sty?
Huh?
You were inspired by a manga?
Yeah? What's the point of the eyepatch?
I'm still in the middle of the first volume.
I will read aloud to you.
Don't bond over that.
As long as you have an imagination, you'll be fine.
I think that might actually be harder.
Fantasize, huh?
The two girls had been good friends since they were children.
Shino!
It will all be mine.
I found the ends of the world.
What would the two of you like to be?
We're in the story?
and peace prevailed throughout the world.
You did it for us.
The top is a pole, and the bottom is... Oh?
Please return to your own classrooms.
Of course not.
This letter was the start of it all.
But wait, you can't speak English!
Welcome, Shinobu.
I'm looking forward to staying here.
Okay!
You can call me Shinobu.
How do you like it, Shinobu?
Sounds fun!this engrish is killing me lmao
Uh... Well...
Here.
I heard that tourists love them.
Let me see it.
Please use them as chopsticks or something.
Come here!
I hope I will visit Japan... some day.
I can't really read it because it's all in English, though.
Can we do this later?!
Wow, you can read English?!
"Your school..."
Sorry!
Um, excuse me.
Alice?
Long time no see!
Cartelet-san, why don't you introduce yourself first?
Just kidding!
Nice to meet you!
Doesn't it make me sound strong and cool?
Broken Japanese?!
people.
Are you an assassin?some sort of assassin. This was all I could think of.
Where are you staying?
You two are hilarious!
I'm looking forward to staying here.
See you next time!

Morning.
That'd leave you barefoot!

Today, I'm here to enjoy another day at a Japanese high school!
I'm in the tenth grade just like the rest of you!
Are you worried about your height?i want to use napoleon complex so badly here but it just doesnt work
But I've only grown three centimeters since elementary school!Grade school? Alternatively "during middle schooljunior high" Also 3cm is roughly an inch.
That's...
Completely hopeless.
It's nothing to get depressed over.
Your chest is smaller because you're shorter?
You like English class, Shinobu?
It's my nickname.
My, you two are such good friends!
Moe!
Shino, is that your own dress?
That simple?!
Uh, how can I help you, sir?original said two, I heard sir. I hate japanese AND english!
Shino's love for the West is reaching maniacal levels.
I like England, France, and...
I'll try drawing a map!
Goodbye, Sensei.
Actually, it might suit you!
A direct hit!
There, there.
You looked great in your dress yesterday, Shino!
Really?
Thank you so much!
so maybe I will dye...
What's wrong, Alice?
Sensei, may I ask a question?
but I want to do something that'll help people.
I love you all!
What's that?probably a gaijin or something
A translator!come to me and we can have private lessons, gurl.

Yes, it's very warm! the one time you can ignore conversation flow
there's something I'd like to give you.
Alice, I get it now!
Mix it well!
Arigatou.
Shinobu!
Good morning!
She's from England...
Whoa, it's real English!
Probably.
Oomiya-san, you're cheerful as usual.
You really came!
Cartlett-san, please introduce yourself to the class.
I transferred from a school in England.
I wrote you a letter.
It was in English...
I know, right?
I want to put a dress on her and stick her in a showcase
and then just stare at her all day! too many 'her's but I don't know what to do
...like people.
Scary.
I wanted to make it a surprise.
Nope!
Even if we fail, with you here
Ooh Yeah!
It's pretty, pretty fun!
an1I can make it through with a smile
I wish I were a kiwi.
I'm looking for my sister.
You're... Youko-chan, right?
Act like an older sister?
What?
How did your last test go, Shino?
You only came to Japan recently, didn't you?
What brings you all here today?
Hey, Isa-nee.
Um, this is for everyone in the house to share.
How nice of you.
Aya-chan, this problem...
You made all this yourself?
You're such a good cook.
No, I...
i1In fact, there's barely any flavour.
It's okay...
Anything but the police!
But instead of taking them here,
Thank you for today.
It's like having two really cute little sisters.
i1Shinobu was an absent-minded child,
How do I usually look?
Youko, let's arm wrestle.
Everyone should have a friend like you.
You're always standing around quietly and smiling,
Fliers for overseas trips.
Everyone's looking!
As you can see, half of you is made up of kindness.
You think so?
Do you have any siblings, Sensei?
I-I'm the youngest of three.
Onii-chan?
But since I'm the oldest child, I wish I had an older sister.
Really?
Isa-nee.
I thought you two had gone home already.
Onee-chan, how about this outfit?
I think something else would suit you better.
Good morning.
It's been a few weeks since I came to Japan.
That could totally work!
There are a lot of foreigners,
Young skin is so smooth and supple.
Kinda like these!
Alice, you have to say hi!
We're going to be late.
Komichi Aya.
Aya is smart and really reliable.
What?
I'm a first-year high school student, just like everyone else!
Why?
You don't have to worry. You'll grow eventually.
Yay!
Your English is the best in Japan!
English!
That was amazing, Alice.
Sensei looked really happy, too.
I'm sorry...
I'm late.
That's pretty hardcore.
They're not. I'm worried.
What's this difference in treatment?
The heck's that?!
A... maid?
Hello!
an8Hiya! I'm happy to help you, sir.
I knew it. Blonde would look weird on me, wouldn't it?
Thank you.
But mine is even prettier.
Calm yourself down with Shino's face.
As if.
It's been my dream since I was young.
You erase your mistakes with them!
I'm sleepy...
A cat or a bunny? this part...
We were talking about our after-school plans.
Really?
Me too!
Read the mood, girl! minus girl?I was originally going to, but this isn't bad
I'm returning your quizzes!
You got a hundred. I think I'd actually say "you got an a hundred"
Alice, have you ever thought about dyeing your hair?
That sounds tasty! pretty fucking sure "mama" is in the typical Japanese person's vocabulary
I never knew Alice had friends in England...
England lies at the other end of that rainbow!
Huh? Karen?
Alice, Alice!
It's a long story.
Isn't Alice here?
Papa, what's Japan like?
Shinobu.
What's gotten into you, Alice?
Really?
and also that her speech is a lot more foreigner-like and appealing,
Alice and Karen...
Karen, sorry I left for Japan without telling you.
Yeah!
but it's not going very well.
To use an animal metaphor,
it's like Karen's a lion trying to mingle with deer! shika?
After that,
Can I go to your house?
We have to show them our Japanese power!
We've lost! really?
It's just a matter of time before they open up to you.
but there's something special about you, Shino.
I hope so.
Oh, is that how it was?
Good luck.
Me! I do!
See you tomorrow!
Good for you.
Bye bye!
At least your reactions are honest.
Yesterday, I climbed one more step up the ladder to adulthood!
Happy birthday to you...
Shino!
Oh yeah, today's your birthday, isn't it?
You speak politely to everyone.
My, my.
My sister has a laptop, I refuse to call them notebooks. You write in notebooks with pens and pencils. And highlighters.
You've done well, Isami-san.
No, I'm the older one!
Older.
The little-sister-est in the world.
Which one?
You can go; I'll get it for you. I was just going to split it, but whatever
Piggyback?
But didn't you just say that you didn't care?
Alice, you're amazing!
What? Wow, thanks!
Are you a mind reader?
I got carried away.
Um...
Look at that face!
I don't mind being the little sister.
Only best friends can have fights like this.
Aya-chan and company are waiting for you. this doesn't sound awkward to me, but my awkward sense is tinglingonly because of the -chan
You worry too much.
Aya! You'll never believe this! or, the literal translation
Maybe it's from a girl.
A delicate girl wouldn't go sliding into a base in the first place.
I wish I had a little more grace.
so why do I feel this way?
Aya, let's go home.
Oh.
I wanted to talk to Alice's parents,
It's boring without her around.
Ouch!
I wonder why.
Bye!
See you!
When she had just transferred in...
What did you have for breakfast yesterday?
Let's see... yogurt! yoghurt looks stupid
I had kiwi yogurt too!
She seriously is spacy.
An easy target for kidnappers.
Let's do our best.
Alrighty!
Obviously not silly things like that!
If you don't mind,
That's...
It looked perfect, but it doesn't really taste right.
I-I'm sorry! I didn't ask...
Ah... um...
Um...
Be a little more natural.
I'm taking it now!
Youko!
I won.
Now I'll be able to hold my own against bears!
It's a smile so bright it could light up the streets at night!
Others may see them as mere slips of paper,
but to me, they're shining treasures!
Aya, do you feel okay?
That's all I am?
That's Youko!
I-I won't say it's zero percent,
Of course I don't.
Really?
O-Onee-chan.
I'm the youngest child in my family.
You're very cute.
Blonde girls.
Alice.
Alice.
Shino.
Seriously...
Let's go to the beach!
What?
I went to the beach a while ago!
We hopped on a plane one Saturday morning.what the fuck
Whoever wins the card game gets to decide where we go!
I wanna go to the mountains!
Yeah!
Water bottle.
Perfect.
Why aren't you a mountain girl?
Forest girls are cuter.
Sometimes girls just have to bear with the pain in order to look good. wow this is so awkward
Okay...
Get in, everyone!
Woohoo!
I see.
You're all so slow!
The fishing stuff is all ready.
Leave the fishing to me! osrgnkionaf
I hope I catch a big one!
I have to show Shino how great I am!
Alice, you're burning me.
Karen, you're so cool!
Alice?
Isn't it delicious, Alice?
There are a lot of bugs.
Huh?
Do you want to swim that badly?
Oh, a crab?
I want to see!
Shino!
We caught a lot of fish in the stream.
Shino, how long have you been there?
Take a look at this.
Blue hair looks quite nice.
Alice, you look so cute!
Yes!
We're just going to the local festival today.
Huh?
I was... eh
Karen.
Too bad.
It's the festival dance! from context
Yo!
Bam!
Fireworks! Fireworks!
Yeah.
How long has it hurt?
Isa-nee!
We just went to a festival.
You need to be in a wide open area for those.
Don't point it at us!
That's dangerous!
What do I do now?
Then, the clock struck midnight on September 1st.
And she hadn't completed any of her summer homework yet!
Let's jump over them with a one-two! A smile is the best
I'm not afraid of problems
Until we recognised
We were simply passing time in vain
In that colour
Things that are cute!
Alice.
Shino.
Shino.
Let's go to the beach!
What?
You look just like a fairy.
I don't want to see a fairy in so much pain.
Hi!
Woohoo!
I bet it'll feel like an accomplishment when we reach the top.
Let's do this.
I wish you were my you-know-what.
There are lots of bugs out here.
i1Just for a little bit.
Blondes...
No!
A float?
What?
There won't be any bonfires or shrines?
How nice.
Blonde hair and a yukata.
It's a good combination.
What?
You look good in a yukata.
Lanterns, torii gates, happi coats!
Karasuma-sensei.
Fried food is good, too.
Go, go!
You too, Alice.
I almost had it...
What is that?
Yay!
I know!
A watermelon.
Shino.
It's burned out.
You do have skyrockets!
My very first time, mountains and a festival, me and Shinobu.
It was as round as a snowglobe.
Spare me!
No, me!
Eventually, these precious days,
Is something happening? ...
Karasuma-sensei,
But she's a teacher...
I managed to borrow the top from her, but I don't have the bottom...
It's like wearing just a long shirt. the style girls usually do with leggings
Yeah, you'll fit right in!
A thousand meters?
They're even slower!
I... I...
Fluffy-fluffy...
Lemme have some of your food! ignoring the issue!
Say "ah"!
Aaaah.
What?
Lunchtime, lunchtime!
It's like they were feeding a cute animal or something.
and I enjoy, so everybody happy!
haven't you gained some weight since you've come to Japan?
Y-You're kidding me!
Start by moving your body in place when you remember to. that didn't follow
Then I'll start running with you, Youko!
Oh, my weight hasn't changed.
You should follow everyone's example.
Rice!
Leaves changing color. literally "leaf viewing"
Huh?
Oh, man...
I thought you were on my side!
I can take on any challenge that faces me today.
Huh?
I've got an idea!
Concentrate!
Shino, you rock!
Now we're the same!
She's still the same old Shino.
Aw, can't I go hang out in the other class?
A maid caf!
If you don't back down...
...I won't walk with you to the bathroom at night!
Why don't we combine the two?
That'd be more like you were expecting before, too. I like it!
Shinos everywhere!
You're good to go.
The day you first went to the beach!
Wrong!
Um... uh...
Alice is feeling down because I couldn't remember.
You look like an octopus.
Alice has been acting like this. feeling down
I know! Hit me as hard as you can!
What?
Oh, so I got
We could call it "Karen's Debut Day"!
W-Welcome!
It looks delicious.
Welcome!
What will you be having today?
Calm down, sir!
Ooh, Japanese-Western Fusion?
Coffee, hot tea, sweet bean cake, and chocolate dango, correct? insert "one" in front of each item?
If it were up to me, I'd put Aya-chan in the Japanese clothes and Youko-chan in the maid outfit. remove though?
What do you think, Alice?
Thank you for coming!
Shi...
Alice!
Did I say something bad again?
P-Please...
For me?
Shino, when you came to my house, ???
I hope you like it.
Finally. Took you long enough
Nice topknot!
You don't need to bring your Japanese dictionary.
We're going to meet Karen at her house and then go over to Aya's together.
I've been waiting!
R-Really?
How did you know?
What are you making?
but you can't be that loose!
How?!
Scary!
Hmm?
Yeah, freedom! isn't that our thing?
I think something went wrong.
It's not like I'm running from her or anything...
You're not pairing up with Aya-chan today?
What?
Maybe I should buy a new notebook too.
I'm going to do a perfect imitation of Ayaya right now!
Legendary beast of studies!
You mean hide-and-go-seek? anyone who calls it "hide-and-go-seek" is an inferior human
One...
i1She'll never guess that I didn't move from the starting point!
Was she found already?
Looks like there's no one here.
Really?
and Shino has the ability to erase her presence completely.
Sorry, I jumped to conclusions.
What are you doing over here?
See you tomorrow.
Alice, how do you say tag in English?
See you next time.
Yay!
Sensei!
Ah! Thank you!
Thank goodness. arueghivs
Shino!
Shino!!
They're so cute!
What is this?
We have a bat and gloves...
What?
Keep your eye on the ball!
Don't worry!
Shino, I did it!
Which one's that?
A new issue of this manga I like came out!
What are you reading?
Don't put too much faith in those horoscopes!
Your positivity can get you through anything!
That doesn't sound like fun.
Yeah.
Wow, that's great.
Go wash your face!
Tell her, Isami!
Isami's on my side!
Oh, it's running away.
I forgot to ask her the most important thing.
I was going to the station!
Youko! Aya!
How did you get that dirty in the first place?
Here, here, kitty-cat!
Sensei!
Someday they're all going to graduate
Next episode, the long-awaited England battle arc will begin.
You're lying!
Who needs coats anyway? punctuation?
Get in the holiday spirit!
I sent my letter months ago! oy
In England, they say that when the snow falls, so falls love.
This year, I want love to be my present!
Puns are hard.
They sure went all out!
And Aya won't wear one even though she'd look great.
Merrymas!
Aya, what's wrong?
Have a good holiday, Mom. this is surprising British
Oh, yeah!
Thanks for having us!
Me too.
Alice, it's still dark outside...
It's the annual present time!
It's so cute!
It's my most precious treasure!
What do I do...
Give me! your voice
What in the world?
Alice, what's wrong?
Do you remember your first dream of the year?
I'll change out of it later.
The language barrier is too strong...
It was always the best part of Sunday roast,
Okay, come on!
So she's now into more British girl. Shino can into anything she wants
I really don't get where you're going with this...
Oh, that one I understood.
The new object of my affections is a different British girl.
Having that as my first dream of the year is the worst omen ever.
That's why I sent a drawing of a treasure ship down the river first thing in the morning! wtf
you'll always be my Alice!
Same to you!
What are you saying, Shino?
That's cruel!
I'm part of the family too!
Onee-sama, I got a perfect score on my last quiz!
Shino...
Alice, can it wait until later?
What color is love?
How do you figure?!
The bright morning sun shines on the beginning of a new day
Through our days, so let's look for them together
The small puddles and the things you worry about today
In that colour
Your singing was great, Aya.
It made me think, "That's our Aya!"
Thanks.
Everyone was smiling while you sang, Alice.
You'll bring smiles to the world!
Please don't!
I'd like to hear you and Alice do a duet.
i1Searching for the sigh of spring and letters of the wind,
It's in your notes, though...
Stop!
You're as slow as you look, Aya.
Shino?
I could keep running for two or three hours.
S-Shino.
Oh, "fluffy".
Alice, are you okay?
Yeah, more or less.
That can't be right!
What are you doing?
Everyone so nice, and I so happy!
I'll run about ten centimetres, then.
i1You're fine the way you are.
My weight hasn't changed.
It's your fault for calling me fat, Alice.
You really shouldn't.
I'd like to eat a packed lunch made by you, too.
Good merrning...
She wrote "rice" on the rice!
How 'bout you, Ayaya?
Think of something that's more fun.
I did everything I could.
Youko, it doesn't look like you're studying much.
i1You can do it, everyone.
We have more tomorrow.
I'm a second-year now!
I'm so excited for all the new things the school year will bring!
What happened?
Different classes?
I know.
Youko! We're here to hang out!
Alice...
Aya!
I've never seen you two have so much in common before.
See?
Ayaya!
Let's have a good year together!
Stand!
Clear skies get you so pumped up!
What fun things await us today?
The main character in this manga is so cool!
I'm telling you, it'll be fine.
Karen, save this for later!...
That's so misleading!
The character has a divine power stored in his left eye.
And you're already like this?
Let's see here.
Just use your imagination and you'll be fine.
Like, let's see...
Nothing!
Knowing you, it's probably about a prince on a white horse, isn't it?
That's pretty funny.
I'll get to you.
We have nothing of value to give you!
Shino...
Why did you take me?
The world has no ends.
The earth is round.
As long as I'm with you...
Shino!
Shino...
Youko can be a prince!
You'll be okay.
But I must not.
I've always wanted to see you again!
What could we possibly do?
Stop the fighting!
And so,
Hey, that was just a story.
"Gakkou"...
Yeah.
Shinobu! Alice-chan!
an1I can make it through with a smile
Just for you, my love
I can't help but feel that you may have the wrong idea.
Our class is going to run a caf.
We'll carry Shino, dressed as a maid, on a palanquin.
But you can expect big things from me.
Youko!
Maybe we should shorten it a little.
We came up with the menu together, after all.
Aya, where are you going?
Sure.
Now, listen...
We're just friends, you hear?!
I'm just picking up some snacks.
If you eat at this hour, you'll get fat.
Welcome back.
You're all working hard.
What?
No matter how you look at it, you've got to wear this.
It's, uh... I know!
i1I have to remember soon.
Listen, Shino.
Good morning.
You look like an octopus.
It's because I'm so stupid.
Coffee in Japanese cups.
Okay.
They're members of the public.
They look delicious.
Sensei, is something wrong?
I'm here.
Welcome.
Isami.
No, you look cute.
Shouldn't you two have dressed the other way around?
i1I need to give her that gift.
i1This is my chance.
Did I say the wrong thing again?
A present?
"Donmai".
It's a magic phrase that cheers you up even when you're feeling down.
With sleepy looks on our faces, we say "Good morning" to each other
There are sparkling fragments scattered
Through our days, so let's look for them together
Even if we fail, with you here
Your laughing voice
I've been waiting for you.
Come on inside.
Thanks for waiting.
What?
Blonde girls bathing is a work of art.
You're so mean!
What...
Huh?
They're difficult for people accustomed to speaking English.
I bet it'd look good on girls, too.
We must value our individuality!
It was fun how it kinda felt like a field trip.
I know.
Karen... I mean, Master!
In that case...
No, more fluently.
How am I supposed to speak broken Japanese fluently?
Oh my god!
You're supposed to kick it with your feet.
Well...
Aya.
What?
Really?
You have failed as my apprentice.
I wanted to make sure I played it when I came to Japan.
One, two, three...
Huh?!
i1...when I was the only one who wasn't found,
Also, keep your voice down in the library.
Shino can erase her entire presence.
Go home before it gets dark.
I get it!
Alice, what's tag called in English?
With sleepy looks on our faces, we say "Good morning" to each other
There are sparkling fragments scattered
Let's jump over them with a one-two! A smile is the best
an1I can make it through with a smile
We met here and now
Good morning.
Your class is next door.
Really?
I don't know the answer!
It'd be nice if you had a nickname that was easier to say.
Like, "Hey, Curry, want some curry?"
You know, I didn't say this earlier,
i1Today's luckiest sign is...
i1Your lucky colour is gold.
Sure, but I don't know the rules.
Ayaya will be the manager.
Like those people on the field who dress up in costumes?
Cheering.
Here we go.
Go! Go, Alice!
You can hit it.
Don't worry.
Can we stop by the bookstore on the way home?
A new volume of the manga I like came out.
It's helped me a lot with my Japanese.
I think you should put your language textbooks into manga format, too.
Good idea.
I'm going to go look over there.
What's it say for Gemini?
You're like my good luck charm.
Really?
I see.
i1Shino gets up late on weekends.
It was an expensive antique.
I see.
A hundred thousand yen?
It's a cat.
Its long tail and whiskers are so cute.
I will.
W-Why am I getting nervous?
We're strong because the person who made this game is our real father.
I'm the one who called your house, anyway...
S-Sister?
We're about to go eat some cake.
Here, kitty, kitty.
O-Okay.
G-Good morning. let's just go the whole nine yards
Good morning, Aya-chan.
but you still need to make sure to be on time.
Guess so!
Shino's doing the screenplay and costumes,also I know I say script, but screenplay is probably better
What about you, Aya?
Let's go with this color.
i1I've been thinking about some things these days.
i1There's no way, right?
i1You and I are best friends!
It looks like we'll be busy through the weekend.through the weekend
Looks like it's almost done.
Ta-da!
Could it be a present for Alice and Karen?
Fidget fidget!
Aya?
B-But how did she do it without blonde hair power?!
Well, I kinda get where you're coming from...
Do you not care about your studies at all?close enough
If you're at the same school, she can help you get ready in the morning!
Then... I wouldn't be able to see you two
Moegi High School.yeah, but
N-No, we can't!
Middle schoolers? Here to look around?
Um, yes!
I can give you a tour if you want.
I really liked this school, so I decided I wanted to be a teacher here.
I'll just work really hard and improve my grades!
Okay, then I'm going to go here too!here
Still, we can't do this all by ourselves.
We'll pass for sure!
You're amazing! You did all of that in one night?
That warmed me up!
Let's have another good year.
Hey, Shino.
You're right. Congratulations.
The ground's slippery, so please don't run!
Huh? Aya?
i1This is harder than I thought it'd be.
I can't, Youko-chan!
Frankly, I don't know how I should feel.
True.
You look good in that uniform, Shinobu.
You feel like a completely different person with that uniform on.
Let's go then, Youko-chan, Aya-chan.
I'm grateful too!
All right, you can open your eyes now.
What I gave you was the gift of friendship! what a cheap cunt
Karen!
We've done everything we could.
Shinobu-chan, you need to give backstage directions!
Do your best!
Who is behind that bush?
I-I...
Nin-nin!
Good afternoon!
I'm really happy I decided to go to this school.
This is the power of friendship!
Hey, stop whispering.
fs24an8Summer Time: The practice of advancing the hands of the clock in summer so that night comes at a later hour than usual
Halo.
i1She's a Japanese girl who looks like a Kokkeshi doll who stayed at my house when I was in middle school.
Is there a goat or a sheep here, huh?
Don't even talk!
Ashura-sama's three faces have their own interpretations.
W-What do you mean?
an8Beautiful, yes.
 an8 This is Meoto Daikokusha.
Then--
Are you sleeping already.
Good morning, class B!
Good morning!
Ah, for good!
Eh?
Want photos?
The height is equivalent to a 4-story building.
But somehow my heart can be moved ....
Easy!
Have you looked through everything, Shino?
Shino, I'm not on the world heritage list.
You still haven't taken a photo?!
Unison is eccentric!
Offer money.
Hah?!
I-Me too.
This Days Inn looks good too, huh.
Since living in Japan, it's only now that I'm this close to Japanese culture.
Even though I only wanted to take a dip with Karen-chan when I dug a hot spring myself!
Do you feel anything after bathing?
Those who survive to the end can ask for anything!
Eh?!
Yes, but once in a while I want to learn Japanese culture.
I also.
Should be a graduation holiday, right?
Aya-chan, exams are fun as long as we're together.
I'm home, Isami.
Aya-chan's face changes.
 an8 Eh? Probably not changed.
You can't force yourself. You have to sleep at night.
Where are you going?
i1Do they really feel reluctant when taught by me?
i1Obviously in a bad mood, huh.
i1But that's not true.
It's nothing, stupid!
Enthusiasm!
You look good in interviews, don't you, Yoko-chan.
Until found.
But ....
My name is Inokuma Yoko.
And somehow, I feel like we'll stay together from now on.
Don't worry, I will definitely pass!
Say it early, man, idiot!
You must not understand either!
Are you still mad that I baked the pancakes earlier?
Your old hairstyle.
Well then, when we return to England....
Do you want to return to England after graduation?
You are also always cheerful, no matter what happens.
Summer vacation is almost here, I'm going to enjoy this last summer of high school to the fullest!
So I'm still keeping it a secret.
Look so young.
Hold on, Shino!
What is this kid saying?
Discretion.
We're friends too thanks to fate, huh.
Alice's mother and mother became close friends from the moment we met.
Joking, kidding.
Of course.
What should I do?
Uh? You look less cheerful today, don't you?
No, I know your temperature to the number of blondes you have, that's why I understand your condition!
After high school, I'll go on to university in England, but I can't stay away from you!
So ....
After all, Alice is the little sister of the whole world.
Anu ....
It's so clich.
I'd like to suggest a combat outfit for your date.
It's okay, really.
Will you hear my confession?
I also.
Karen?
I'm compared to the country!
You want to stay in Japan, don't you, Karen?
He was constantly seduced.
Maybe I studied too hard yesterday.
i1Even when he was staying in England, what I feared didn't happen.
I want to send a letter abroad.
Oh, you don't have to.
How much do you want to give?
And this ....
What about Hina?
Iya, iya.
Miss Karasuma is also there!
It's enough.
I also!
I think you're a lucky kid.
Don't worry, I know the trick!
It's nothing.
You and I didn't register, but I was worried about my friends.
Why are you two dancing?
Alice!
What happened?
After the SBMPTN, the next exam is the second, yes.
You don't have to worry, I haven't forgotten anything.
This.
Wait a minute, somebody, give me something!
Aya is very good, yes!
But the fact is, the good news doesn't always come.
Stop it!
We're not nervous anymore after seeing you two.
Stay cool.
They will surely succeed.
Can!
Hey, don't just assume you didn't pass!
Stay cool.
He is back.
It worked, it worked!
Are you sure you asked me that?!
What are you doing, idiot?!
Why?
You're paying too much attention to me, Honoka.
The cherry blossoms have bloomed!
We will come later.
She was already crying before the ceremony started.
Ayaya, I'll give you toilet paper so you can cry for a long time.
Karen-chan, everyone, good morning!
What's more memorable is this scene!
You said you wrote your introduction to college in English, didn't you?
It was thanks to your own efforts, Shino.
You really are.
The teacher held back tears.
I also want to get it from Mrs. Kuzehashi who I always bother with.
We finally passed, too.
Let's throw Alice together!
Stop it!
Introductory class, yes.
Then I'm half a year older than you, Alice.
Can.
to reminence about various scenes revolving, like a lantern.
I am here, for... a re-examination of the stomach.
Even so, there's still a change I might have polyp.
Stop saying nonsense! My body is hardcore!
No way! You too, also!
Oh, by myself!?
So, this is the inside of my stomach. This is awesome!
But, doctor...
Then again, I can give him a pat, on the shoulder!
Heh, a trip? 
You're wrong! Take a look at this!
Oh... You'll drink something, right? All right, today's my treat!
Huh, this feels awesome, Hajime-chan!
From now on is going to be pretty hard for two weeks!
Nice to meet you! I'm Kindaichi.
Her neighbor is, Kawasaki-sensei.
Pleased to meet you!
Ah, you're the student from then, I remember.
Actually, here was a sanatorium.
You guys get along pretty well. Are you perhaps lovers?
Don't say that. Enough... Hahaha. Well!
Wh-- What's, with this affectionate bastard!?
There's not enough color in the Kanji, so you can't read it, right?
Huh, bad things? No way, what things will happen?
Well, when tomorrow the 15th of August comes, I'll tell you all about it!
Whoa!
You're somehow less than I expected, hearing you were collage students!
Yes!? I'm a employee!
This hostel, is owned by Otemon and the seminar too.
There ...
From now on, we'll be living together for two weeks. So you guys, get long!
can go you go around and contact everyone, telling them to gather here?
The test of courage? You can't mean,
Yeah! It's being held here every year.
What... !? What kind of test of courage will it be?
they're actually appear, that is the ghosts.
Ah! Kawashima-kun will also be joining us. But he'll appear in a different form.
There was a floating corpse, in a body bag!
I'm sorry! That's the hole story!
You're a newbie and a man, right? Of course, you're the first choice!
No way, I don't want to. That's like poison tasting, isn't it!?
Even, if you say It like that.

No, actually, until now I was preparing a bird.
Ah, so you're cooking a bird right now?
What's with this guy?
Are you alright, master?
That's right. Hurry up and leave.
Way too freakin' bitter.
Brothers? Couldn't be... friends?
And you already have a full confession?
Then I'll have the curry...
Whatever.
I've finished laundering your uniform.
He's...
Superb! This is the perfect blend of spices.
I hope the dessert's as good.
I chose this place, so I get the first request!
Eh? But I already asked!
It's true. I saw it on TV.
Well, then, here's the watermelon.
We were pretty lucky today to have found this place.
Didn't you forget something?
Seriously?
And this place is so messy...
the knife and fork!
I really am the master!
Not just the watermelon, but all the vegetables in this bench.
The victim.
Really?
Call an ambulance!
Yeah, just look around.
It's fine if they're for yourself.
When mama-san was struck, she collapsed onto the counter.
That guy didn't know what this was.
Apparently he was an assistant professor.
Wait for me!
It seemed the murders were over when the one student without an alibi committed suicide.
O-Okay.
He's the grandson of a famous detective
I don't really want to talk about that.

Aino was a little too good.
Kirisawa's scores did a downward slide, to where it looked like he'd have to quit.
They switched it.
What?! Ujie-sensei and Aino are father and son?!
It was obviously strange.
Don't tell me...
What's wrong, Kindaichi?
Calling us all the way over here...
W-What are you talking about, Kindaichi?
Everyone here was in a classroom.
But when I compared the schedules of Moonlight Mansion and Sunlight Mansion,
In Moonlight Mansion,
The first one, at Moonlight Mansion...
She left the classroom because she just happened to finish the biology test quickly.
Two of these questions are extremely hard and impossible to solve during the class time.
And since you collected all the tests, there would be no proof left.
How can hers have been poisoned when no one knew which one she'd take?!
It can't be! I didn't feel a thing!
That's right. Nobody noticed.
The five murders that took place yesterday,
Sunlight Mansion
Nope. Look at the layouts for both places.
All of the stairways were locked.
To disguise that,
That's why you threw water on his legs, which weren't on fire, instead of his upper body.
you talked about combustion in chemistry class so it would look like a "theme murder".

Old man Kenmochi became a wanted felon.
Come on! You're gonna arrest him?!
Inspector Kenmochi! Please drop it!
What is this?!
There is a platform.
That's...
If that's the case, he did have time to drug it.
If you're callin' me the killer, you better justify it!
But first, I want to ask you something.
Busujima called the police at 16:30.
I didn't do it!
I already know how you did it.
There's a bathtub on this floor, so I'll use it for a recreation.
Nanase Miyuki Incoming Call
It's a lie! Kenmochi's the killer!
The real criminals are Tamaki-kun and Uozaki-kun.
I killed Tamaki and Uozaki, but made it look like Kenmochi did it.
My house is a factory, so it's noisy day and night.
Togami!
Sorry...
And she vanished from her job.
When I left empty-handed,
Togami tried to escape out the window...
We're best buds, right, Bu-chan?
If only you'd realized before then,
Please, Busujima!
I'm sure Togami died thinkin' I was the one who was responsible for all of it.
But at some point, you changed your mind and wanted to tell the truth.
Why was that?
I don't believe it!
You yourself may cast judgment upon those sinners.
That's the kind of guy old man Kenmochi is.
My sister will never come back,
but I think I feel a little better now.
Don't give me that face.
But Busujima-kun doesn't have anything to do with this.
And the scene is a locked room!
The game of life and death has just begun!
Will we be able to make it out alive?
The Game Mansion Murder Case
I've got two of them. How about it, Miyuki-chan?
Look, Hajime-chan! Isn't it amazing?!
Jeez!
Leave it to me! I should be able to cover us both for bus fare...
Here.
O-Okay...
Are you okay, Miyuki?
I think I twisted my ankle.
Thanks, Hajime-chan.
It's okay?
That's right. So what are we doing here?
Calm down, Ikuma!
Who will be able to leave here alive?
Answer each question with a four-digit number.
Uh-oh. But an honors student like Miyuki...
If I recall, it was built in 1970!
Hajime-chan, I can't leave you behind!
Stupid! I don't need 100 million yen!
6, 5, 3, 2. Miyuki should know this one!
Miyuki, have faith in me!
K-Kindaichi?!
I'm Kikukawa Kozue. I work at a hostess bar.
And this faint-hearted guy who turned pale is Sugimoto Jun.
Now, let the second stage begin!
A key attached to a puzzle ring!
Dammit!
I can leave at any time.
Pass that through the ring in your left hand!
Go!
Um, key...
Okay, I got it! Go! And once you're out, close the door fast!
He must've died.
I've prepared Cup Noodles for everyone. There's hot water, too.
Eat it all?
Mugibayashi Mika
What's wrong? You're not gonna have 'em taste it?
Okay.
Wait a second. Come to think of it, I hope these chopsticks are safe.
The poison could've been put on the chopsticks themselves!
What?!
Wait! I haven't eaten the noodles...
It won't open!
And now for the final game.
Anyway, we gotta find the key!
I did it! I did it, Mama! I found it!
Do you think he could've found the key in the bathroom?
maybe it means the key really is hidden in here.
Now that you mention it...
What is this?!
D-Dammit! G-Getting dizzy...
Why did Shimomura Shiho suddenly let me escape?
I couldn't get cell phone service there,
So Sugimoto-kun and I got on the last bus.
It's a gambling debt so a bankruptcy wouldn't cover it.

to make it so that she alone would be unable to answer and left behind.
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns! The final episode!
Then Shimomura Shiho and her son, Ikuma, were killed.
Takaragi Shigeru
What are you talking about?!
I don't know about that.
But Shouzou died soon after Ikuma was born.
So if Shiho and Ikuma died, where would that fortune go?
No. That's incorrect.
And that "A" is one of you.
Mugi-mama?!
So if you smelled gas in that situation,
normally you'd think it was poisonous, right?
But that was a mistake.
Takaragi-san wrote on his blog that he hates alcohol.
You're suggesting I made it
Maybe the eye of that mask is blocked so she can't see the question.
What do you mean?
so you see flat images in three dimensions.
This mask has 3D glasses attached.
Question What does the Swahili word "mashariki" translate to in Japanese?
who were there, wouldn't be suspected.
She survived, with a changed name and face.
I murdered the Shimomuras, mother and son.
That was the last time I saw him.
That's when you were a high school student.
and eventually, I took over the bar.
K-Kozue!
I'm sure my mom had it rough.
You noticed?
I'm not reliable yet,
Yeah!
but a girl is taken to the hospital after an accident at the diving pool.
Don't give me "Are you up"! What are you tryin' to do, drown me?!
So this is the boy you were telling me about on the phone who can't swim.
Her boobs are huge!
Sheesh! You make it sound so simple!
Isn't she great? Only three middle school students at our swimming school
Of course! That high school's swim team is one of the tops in the nation
She's not quite as good as the other two, but she's still talented, right?
T-That's cruel...
I just bought a new one, so why not change into this?
Hey! Nijieda-san!
Who are you?!
That's right. The idea is for him to learn how to swim this summer.
By that rich bitch-type, Mitsuyo or whatever...
Maybe it's the curse of the Evil Spirit of the Diving Pool.
Leave me alone!
...I think I was distracted by Nanase-san's loud voice...
Is it possible that she was also surprised by the voice and lost her balance in midair?
Even though it wasn't like that before...
I'll prove that you're not the least bit in the wrong.
Once in a while, you can be depended on, Hajime-chan.
Hajime, you're the one who squished the tofu, didn't you?
It broke up!
Even though they fell from the same height, why did only this one get crushed?
Sure it is. After all, it's super-concentrated salted fresh water.
Is that true, Hajime-chan?
Because of that, when something hits the surface of the water,
to make this huge pool into salt water like the Dead Sea.
knowing that it would make Nijieda Mitsuyo fired up about not missing it herself.
so you used the hair as a prop,
I want to team up with Miharu and have us both win medals together.
But you've got a more immediate goal to aim for, Hajime-chan.
You'd better be able to swim 25 meters by then...
Hey! Miyuki! I-I can't!
Liar! You're the only one who would do a silly prank like...
What is this?! Did you put something in my mouth?!
I said I didn't do anything!
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
Murder at 10,000 Meters
Wrong! It was me!
It wasn't terrorism.
The prank-like terrorist threat received before takeoff and the smoke bomb fuss, too...
W-Wait a second!
that would only be the actress, Ishida-san, and the cameraman, Ohgoshi-san.
Hey, what are you saying about one of your passengers?!
I'm an actress! What's wrong with an actress freshening up in the restroom?!
Okay, okay, both of you...
to take advantage of the panic and slip away for ten minutes.
The captain came into the cabin during the incident and spoke to the passengers.
If it was really him.
Two?!
One of them knocked out the captain and put the plane on auto-pilot.
There are plenty of grounds, but what stuck in my mind
Is that all, Detective?
Not to mention proof that it was me who came out and dealt with the passengers?
a6Do you feel all right?
She's a cabin attendant, right?
You... You...!
People who want to live but don't make it... It happens all over the world.
You're the only one who can fly the plane!
Yes, sir!
a6Please fasten your seatbelt securely.
Descend and maintain 4,000 feet immediately.
Your emergency situation is understood.
All we can do is have faith, right?
Here they come!
JAM Air 377, request landing clearance.
Lean forward and cover your head!
That's led to a lot of accidents.
Great job. Please stand by on the runway.

I swear I'll blow the lid off of the Puppeteer from Hell's perfect crime!
That person carefully coordinated with Ujie-sensei to carry out the crimes.
Class D
Konoe's murder, which we thought happened in the hallway of Moonlight Mansion,
You!
If everyone had been in Sunlight Mansion, then something doesn't make sense!
Sunlight Mansion
Hajime-chan, what are you looking for?
This is Sunlight Mansion, so of course it'll say "Sunlight Mansion", right?
Making Sunlight Mansion look like Moonlight Mansion...
There's definitive proof!
The science group was supposed to be in Moonlight Mansion the whole time,
W-What do you mean, Hama-san?
Aino-kun really was an amazing person.
moved their sights from me to Aino-kun and terrorized him mercilessly.
Don't make us keep repeating ourselves!
Listen, I wouldn't tell anyone else about this.
She won't spill about this, will she?
As Hell's servant, I listen to the voices of those who died untimely deaths.
That's enough of your indecent excuses.
Hama-san!
Yes, sir!
H-Hi, Aino-kun.
Yeah. The weather's been nice since then.
Don't miss the next show.
I don't wanna go home yet.
Wait! This is super-heavy!
Where?! It's your guys' fault for walkin' so fast!
Thank you!
Would you like something to drink, sir?
Tea, please, no milk or sugar.
Um, gimme more snacks and cola and orange juice!
I'm your captain, Shida Tomoaki.
We're currently off the coast of Aomori.
The captain is Shida-san, huh?
Sheesh. And Miyuki's just as bad...
Oh, the actress who's famous for a cheating scandal?
I guess work isn't goin' well because of that.
She's probably stressed out.
A cameraman? That's even fishier!
While shooting in a war zone, he gets chummy with dangerous characters and joins 'em!
I said I'm getting off!
Right.
I think it was a little before 2:30.
It isn't necessarily a passenger.
Sure, of course, Akechi-san.
Dammit! That jerky superintendent doesn't trust me at all!
Captain Shida?! A nice person like him was murdered?!
You're the actress, Ishida Mariya-san, aren't you?
I went to the restroom to fix my makeup.
After all, your seat was next to mine, Inspector Kenmochi.
so I can't stand the idea of being under suspicion.
I wonder if there's any connection...
Oh? What's that, Inspector Kenmochi?
Well, he's won many awards for his photos of terrorism sites.
But there's something that's bothered me from the very beginning.
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
A special incident brought that home to me.
The Campground "Ghost" Case!
Cafe Owl
No way! It's alive?!
Yep.
Not yet?
How long's he gonna stare at me?
so we decided to spend a night observing a meteor shower.
Juri's right. We're totally unlucky to get stuck with an infamous slacker like you!
Hey, Okazaki, who do you have your eye on? We better not go after the same girl...
At least Miyuki's safe for now.
Wow! This is awesome!
Yay! I'm glad I brought my swimsuit along!
I'm using a dried squid snack 'cause I forgot bait, so don't expect anything.
Knock it off! You guys are pervs!
Forget it. The detergent will flow downriver.
And in the first place, you'd still be able to see us from the river!
Then what about Kin-dumb-ichi?
Yeah. Let's go.
It's tough doing laundry in the river. But I better put 'em out to dry before dark.
Glare...
W-What's wrong?
Come on, whip 'em out! Here? Or here?
I don't even have a pen. See?
I say Okazaki is suspicious!
Don't worry, Miyuki!
I swear it in the name of my grandfather!
It's not like the crow was trying to steal the panties.
The sun would've been shining down right between the trees,
pinpointing the spot where you left your clothes.
Then...
So I do this and suddenly hit them with the light...
Yeah!
You're surprisingly competent, Kin-dumb-ichi.
More!
But then why is it staring at me like that?
From: Reina-chan To: Kindaichi Yoo-hoo! My shoot is over! Well, see you later.
Some people say owls are lucky, but it's a damned lie!
Was her accident really caused by an evil spirit that haunts the swimming school?
In the U.S.?!
Is there somethin' going on with him?
Just be careful around that new student and keep an eye on him for me.
Sure, but...
Hi, Erina-chan!
and I think I've recovered a lot, too.
I remember him. He's tall and was a college student back then.
her father filed a civil suit against the three adolescent criminals.
Erina-chan...
Those bastards...
I wish they'd all die!
Three years ago, a female corpse was found buried in an empty lot in the city.
The murder got a lot of media coverage.
even the ringleader, Busujima, has been released three years later from a facility.
They committed senseless violence against her to satisfy their sick desires.
Scary! Another minute with you and I bet you'd kill me.
belonged to Inspector Kenmochi.
Figures. That alone doesn't prove the old man is the shooter.
Do you remember the corpse that was found three years ago?
So what does that have to do with the old man?
Old man...
Why would you think so?
Dammit! The other guys are probably targets, too!
Three years ago, you were one of the minors taken into custody for abandoning a corpse.
And don't tell anyone else that I was here today.
Excuse me...
Uozaki... is dead?
And old man Kenmochi is under suspicion.
But he's not the kind of guy who'd do somethin' like that!
Uozaki Youhei
I swear I'll prove the old man innocent!
The bastards laughed at seeing my sister in agony.
Togami Marina-chan was one of his students then.
On the surface, my husband calmly investigated the case,
but I'm sure he couldn't stand
Yes, sir!
This is an all points bulletin!
Then that means you personally don't suspect him, right?
Akechi-san, give me the contact info for the lawyer in charge of the case back then.
They were extremely cruel to the victim.
Death by Strangulation
One possibility is fire.
Detective Aoi, please take Busujima into custody quickly.
Considering Busujima got attacked, too, I think you're too laid back.
It made me sick.
Hajime-chan!
Did you park in your usual place?
I'm not implying you're the one who did it.
Are there any prints on this joystick?
It's too early to feel relief. After all, the killer has kidnapped the old man.
Akechi-san...
I'll aim to prove that Inspector Kenmochi is indeed the perpetrator.
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns! Inspector Kenmochi, Murderer, File 3!
Tamaki Takumi
I'll talk to him.
Do we have a location on him from his phone?
How about Inspector Kenmochi's cell phone?
Let's close in!
Can we hear Busujima's phone call one more time in here?
You recorded it, right?
This is the only batting center in the area.
On a floor that's mostly empty!
What were you doing during the two days you were out of contact?
The last thing I remember is talking to Busujima in the park.
You're also suspected of the attempted murder of Busujima Riku.
were in a locked room together.
Those are all tricks, of course!
Can I talk to you in private, Kindaichi-kun?
After Busujima's shooting,
She doesn't have an alibi for the time of death, 7 AM,
but she was at her high school kendo club's morning practice less than ten minutes later.
If everyone has a perfect alibi, that makes everyone suspicious.
Indeed. Because if a trick is involved, that invalidates the alibis.
and the attempted murder of Busujima in that locked room.
Like you, he wouldn't solve anything by killing.
Yeah, but wait a sec.
He's gonna kill me! Like with the other guys!
What was the killer thinking?
a5Vacant Vacant Busujima
which includes the probable position of the couch before the door was opened.
but this is like obsessively clean.
Akechi-san, can I borrow the key to this floor for today?
I'm not hungry right now.
Motive, means, and opportunity.
Tamaki Takumi
Please, old man!
Inspector Kenmochi, Murderer
Busujima-kun, where are you?
And make sure they're trustworthy! Not just one! At least three or...
they must have sent it from a cell phone.
There it is.
And there's about a six-second interval between each sound...
There! This time there was a 12-second interval!
Someone must have locked it from the inside!
Superintendent Akechi! The defibrillator!
Superintendent Akechi...
Old man, you may not believe in yourself, but I believe in you.
So you just recuperate.
I swear I'll find proof that you're no murderer.
Hotel  Meals
Broken from being dropped in the water during a call.
His alibi at the time of Uozaki's time of death is ironclad.
If everyone has a perfect alibi, that makes everyone suspicious.
Indeed. Because if a trick is involved, that invalidates the alibis.
Do you remember who abducted you then?
Marina... Busujima is still alive.
Why?
The door wasn't locked, but was firmly blocked by this sofa.
a5Vacant Vacant Busujima
U-Um, does that mean anything?
You did it! It worked!

The fire alarm went off.
Maybe I better evacuate, too...

The height is just over 30 centimeters.
You left behind the remote, which had the inspector's fingerprints on it.
A single word?
There's a bathtub on this floor, so I'll use it for a recreation.
Miyuki...
Would you explain this?
My family runs a small medical equipment company
My house is a factory, so it's noisy day and night.
You have this bad-boy image,
Busujima-kun, for someone who looks tough, you have cute tastes.
Bastards! What did you do to her?!
As accomplices, let's put our heads together.
I loved that girl!
Say it was all your idea!
Where was it?
his father stopped dealing with the Busujima family's company.
I needed Director Tamaki's recommendation for her to have surgery.
Hey, Busujima.
That's the kind of guy old man Kenmochi is.
My sister will never come back,
And the scene is a locked room!
But there's nothing to be happy about!
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuitous line.

"This is the place we belong." They thought.
Yeah! Xin, we'll become heroes in there!

This is totally inedible!
I thought it was you!
Dad! Xin glared at me!
Who do you think you are?!
They'll hear you, you idiot!
Our first target'll be this house!
I get it.
Serves in the royal palace!
A minister?
Are you saying I can be a government officer?
I think I'd like to sort out my feelings.
You idi-
I'm sure I'll see you again soon!
We're headed to the same place!
Right! I'll overtake you before you know what happened!
Thanks.
Xin, you've changed a little, haven't you?
And the king even killing all of his retainers?
Don't worry about it, Xin.
But the idea about speeding things up is actually quite interesting.
Piao. This is Xin. Starting today, you'll be living with him.
We can escape it! With the power of the sword!
Power of the sword?
It doesn't hurt.
Th... The king's little brother started a rebellion?
The king's younger brother's forces were... large enough to... overthrow the capital...
Pursuer...
I-I under-
Not a single one!
I don't understand at all!
I'll tear them limb from limb!
Hey!
So I want to get revenge for Piao, too!
You really intend to go, Xin?
And we don't know what's going on with the king's younger brother's rebellion...
It doesn't matter if it's a den of murderers, and it doesn't matter what's going on!
What is this you speak of?
The idea that the throne was gained because of L Buwei is an entirely baseless rumor...
Dun, forward.
t-this person was... a-already dead...!
I-I don't know!
Which one do you-
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.
That's right... Thought
Still wanna go?
What the hell is this? Thought
When something makes a person's spirit burn,
Next time,
and the anxiety that makes me waver
a6I knew at the start that there's no end.
a6Now's the only time.
Ya got that right!
Somebody... else is coming...
He looks like him, but he's not Piao!
You can no longer escape.
Your life is mine,
Xin... Our strength and our hearts are alike...
That's it, kid.
Let's have a thorough look at your skill.
Have you yet to take my brother's head?
so he should be back with his head momentarily.
But Jie Shi, there are still other obstacles besides my older brother.
The Zheng army soldiers suffered from starvation.
But the supreme commander, General Bai Qi,
It was the battle of hell, at Changping.
Do you think you've beaten me?
Shit!
It's true that in terms of raw power, Xin and I are equals.
But if there's some stalwart opponent that even I can't win against, Xin can.
For some reason, he's usually equal to me.
He sounds bothersome.
Then he won't win.
He disappeared! Thought
My king, if I were to fall, Flashback
I'm sure that he... Flashback
This is Xin's power... Thought
People's lives don't belong to anyone.
Don't try to confuse me with crap I don't understand!
It seems that you have yet to find your own path.
My... path...?
Wh-What? What's going on?
An army. Quite a large one.
The only way out's through the river!
Like hell I'm dying in a place like this!
If you give them my head, that may grant you a path to survival.
so we'll have to slip through along the river!
I'll take my time to figure out whether to kill you or not after I've broken through this encirclement!
I know a way through.
a6Voice of mine
a6Yeah
will you discover a new light, Xin?
over one hundred states were destroyed, one by one, until only seven were left standing.
Ta-da.
Target the coach! That's Chancellor Jie!
Yes, sir!
It is probable that the reason the Mountain People descended from the mountains on this occasion...
Have you enjoyed your brief moment of glory, Chancellor Shi?
Showing himself without any guards... foolish.
Understood.
That's right. Let's go, Xin.
Ow!
This way.
does this really lead to where Chengjiao is?
But rest assured.
We'll be wiped out!
Charge!
Sir!
Gather all of the palace's guards!
Zuoci!
You know him?
Don't make light of Zuoci!
But inside the royal palace,
besides Zuoci and Weixing,
But...
You bastards... are too cocky.
Th... This is Zuoci?! Thought
It just won't! Thought
a6Voice of soul
Ancient China.
You're the one who's too cocky, moron!
I'll kill you!
Where the hell you two hiding that kind of power?
Just the other day he was racking his brain over if he could become a general...
I said I'll become it and I will!
And also...
It's a perilous path!
No matter what kinda path it is, I'll...
don't screw with me!
H-Hey...
Xin!
Prepare yourself... king.
the strongest under the heavens.
You harmed Lord Zuoci quite a bit, didn't you?
Bi! Get a hold of yourself! Bi!
What?
Really...
But!
What?! Thought
That Changwenjun is glum as usual...
Who knows...
But that's plenty!
Did someone close to you die or something?
Don't scare me like that!
I wonder just what kind of person they are...?
Are you ready, Xin?
Hell yeah!
To weave together my breaking heart
a6Voice of soul
Sadness is sure to turn into strength
a6I won't fear
Swords have become powerless.
But to be up against Zuoci and such numbers...
He can't sleep after we've come this far!
Opening
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
and they are now in combat with 300 of Shi Shi's soldiers in Gongong Plaza.
Could he have allied himself with the Mountain People in order to take the throne back for himself?!
Victory is... before our eyes?
This is a battle between Chengjiao and me!
Even now, our separate squadron is attacking it and are sure to defeat the two leaders!
All we must do is to endure until then!
He continues to move forward knowing that as well.
Xin...
Xin...
already... dead.
Everyone past here is unarmed.
Eyecatch
I guess you're prepared for what's coming to you.
The punishment for pieces of shit like you breathing the same air as me is... death.
Hey, hey! I think the crazy one here is you!
I know we were told to wait on standby, but wouldn't it be better if we got moving?
The situation's been reversed.
And around him was the awful sight of 20 corpses.
After living several years alone in the mountains he lost his humanity.
He was quite difficult to restrain.
If you remain as a beast, you will be slain here and now.
If that beast were to be released,
That's it, Captain!
That monster is losing?!
Awesome, Captain!
I gaze at the fragments of a dream No more crying
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
Ah... My head got hit...
It's a corpse.
Well, another guy gave the finishing blow,
Piao, where're you going?!
Xin.
Even though he'd lost the will to fight, with one word from Chengjiao...
That's what the black market merchant that sold me Lankai said.
That is the true form of the controlled side!
When it comes down to it, the only thing that obeys you is an ape that doesn't know any better!
The king wishes to personally take his head.
Changwenjun!
Everything depends on the person using it!
Shunmen!
Stand up and crush those insects!
Eyecatch
And the work of exhausting every means to rise to the position of chancellor...
Death! You will all be punished with death!
I'm not done yet!
Such a thing cannot happen!
Because this is war.
No, more importantly...
D-Don't fuck with me!
A great life, totally different from the one you lived in that awful village, is waiting for you...
Just who is it you say killed him?
If there's any chance he's still alive...
Shi Shi! You're the chancellor's officer, aren't you?!
Weixing, just what I'd expect from my right hand. Thought
Sadness is sure to turn into strength
a6I won't stop
Kingdom 15 Translation by Kewl0210
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years...
swallow me.
a6I knew at the start that there's no end.
My treasure sword will not forgive irreverent words...
In these 500 years of war
Wang Qi! You lost your most beloved master,
Only then will you fly across China.
I cannot allow a warrior of your caliber to be buried in the ground...
Wang Qi, when that time comes, you must fly even higher than you do now.
They firmly grasp the path to China.
One could say it's the arrogance of youth,
Let us leave this matter here for today.
Damn you, Wang Qi.
We... have lost?
You are nothing more than a fool who mistakenly believes the fortune one was born with equates to their value.
All you did was look down on those around you!
For the sake of your whims,
It's meaningless for it to happen any more!
S-Spare out lives?!
He's fine. Anyhow, what's happening in the plaza?
I see...
I'm glad you are as well.
It's turning into a real party.
Diao looks like he's doin' well.
Lord Yang Duan He decided to take that child in.
I guess he's originally a Mountain Person.
And...
Right.
I see.
You must be glad, Xin!
We got a house!
You should be thankful!
I've made it this far, Piao.
Piao met with Zheng and then Zheng met with you...
That man quietly kneels down.
But I can't keep going like this forever.
I never got the money he promised me!
Why? Well... You know.
Are you gonna be okay?
If L Buwei seriously starts a rebellion,
Cai Ou? It's been quite some time.
I, Meng Wu, am the strongest in all of China!
I trust that you will.
You speak of something quite tremendous.
Governor of law, Li Shi.
Diplomacy and general advisor, Cai Ou.
These four, known as the Four Pillars,
Even though there were just four, they were no ordinary people.
Having you be concerned for me...
Is that right? Flashback
And I'm ready to go!
Can't you read?
Oh? So what's written there?
You'll finally go on your first campaign!
a6I won't cry
This is awesome.
swallow me.
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuous line.
a6Now's the only time.
It ain't stupid!
I'm seriously gonna become it!
Wuchangs, gather!
Tian You, wait!
It's Zhong Tie!
Then we'll take both brothers.
Really?
I'll take the five of you on myself, idiots!
Nobody'd wanna put their lives in the hand of a Wuchang that unreliable.
Nice to meet you, everyone.
A-Awesome!
What's with that guy?
Imagined? What?
Don't go imagining worthless crap like that!
And their Thousand-Man General is often quite violent, so...
A Thousand-Man General is coming.
I guess he must've worked for him before as a servant.
The 4th army is at Wan Castle...?
He is a monstrous general which, in the last war, led just 2,000 soldiers to attack 30,000 enemy soldiers.
At that time at Wan Castle...
What happened to General Hei Gang?!
and attack Rongyang head on.
You just stepped on my foot, didn't ya?!
What's with you?
Whole army?
That's Rongyang's entire defense!
Does he have some strategy...? Thought
He is quite quick to adapt.
I don't know.
It's different from with Muta and Lankai...
Something huge!
Sadness is sure to turn into strength
a6I won't stop
Shit, there's no way in!
Next time,
What's going on?!
Don't go in front of the guide chariot!
It's getting heavier and heavier...
Ancient China.
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years
until over one hundred states were reduced to merely seven.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
and the anxiety that makes me waver
the flame of war between both countries was finally lit.
With lightning speed, he put the State of Qin on the defensive.
Bi...
This guy's a childhood friend of mine.
in regard to our terrain and battle formations, we are also entirely at a disadvantage!
Good, that's easy enough to understand.
As long as strength remains in your bodies, cut, cut, cut them all down!
We came to... the front line...
Let's just do our best and try to get through it.
It's no use, Wuchang...
Yes.
Weaklings have their own way of fighting.
We'll have 5 people attacking as well as 5 people defending.
I knew they'd be here!
Xin?!
What're you doing?!
K-Kill him!
Is it because this is my first campaign?
So this is a battlefield?!
This is nothin'!
and the flow of the beginning of the battle tilted utterly towards the Qin army.
Or so it seemed.
Xin!
Didn't you hear what the Wuchang said?!
Wei Ping, it's all right.
we may have been killed in the impact in the front lines.
I can't believe they've sent them out this early!
If those rampaging horses came head-on...
Don't space out!
It's not a bad idea.
There's a little puppy!
Just try it, you carriage bastard!
They're turning around?!
Concentrate on the front right now!
He did it!
but the biggest reason is that the order to attack has yet to come from the main army's General Biao Gong.
Bi Unit, we're going to check on the situation on the front lines!
That order is nonsensical.
Did you come to this battlefield for the purpose of saving foot soldiers?
Your opponent is the chariot itself!
The chariot itself?
The one from before? Thought
With the mobility of the horse... Thought
nor the past where we laughed together
a6Voice of soul
Ancient China.
swallow me.
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
those are scenes that won't disappear.
Xin!
Fu Hushen, how is it you can be so sure of victory in this situation?
Wei Vice General, Gong Yuan, grew impatient among the momentum
However...
So a section of the 4th's soldiers defeated some chariots?
but they actually sway the board in varying ways.
That is the way of war.
You, men who have overcome a desperate struggle from the jaws of death,
Get in charging formation!
If you don't want to die, go with all your strength!
What the hell?!
It's as Xin says. There is a chance.
It's Fu Hushen!
Back up the Fu Hushen's advance!
How many men are left?
This kid... Thought
Enemy attack!
Form a pincer from the left and the right!
I-Impossible!
He's quick.
Mounted unit, move forward with all your might!
The vanguard always have the most severe path in front of them!
There's a bowman unit!
A war is not such a cheap thing! Thought
He saw my arrow?
But he's too close!
a6Voice of soul
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
the many piled up meetings we've had
This dream cannot be broken.
and the anxiety that makes me waver
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
The state of the battle is extremely grim.
Get some big achievements and come back, okay?
Those who bring heart-warming tales of their comrades' sacrifices into battle
Lord Fu Hushen!
Against a military force of over 1,000, we have less than 10 men.
Thousand Man General said it's because our allies made sacrifices
An urgent report!
You've got the same imprecise fighting style as always, Biao Gong.
But Lord, it is a crime to joining a battle without expressed permission.
Unfortunately, this is the furthest we are able to set foot.
Who said anything about joining a battle?
Now, then.
I see...
So he's returned to the battlefield once again,
We did it... We finally did it...
took those Wei guys' hill!
I feel like I still had things to learn from you.
Wh-Who is this guy...?!
He's too gigantic! I can't tell!
Then why don't you try me?!
every last one of them was split in half with this treasured sword.
Didn't you know?
Qiang Lei...
With the added advantage of the high ground on this hill
And the other is the instinctual type that fights with wild intuition.
Don't understand?
Which is wrong?
You're...!
Ancient China.
human desire was unleashed.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
swallow me.
A way through?!
There are so many escape routes underground that you could easily get lost.
We don't even know this guy's name!
You can tell just by looking at you that you're as common as they come.
What is it?!
was that I lacked the power to do so.
Of course, that did not result in a child being truly in the position of king.
The royal palace was split in two, revolving around those two,
If there's a battle going on between fellow ministers,
He established several rendezvous points in case we got separated during the escape.
For a... remote possibility...?!
Gimme a fucking break!
Flashback starts
Your highness...
I'll allow it. Said over Chang's line
Y-Your highness!
As a servant coming from a country village to serve at a royal palace,
Flashback Ends
I shouldn't need to tell you which one will get you closer to that absurd dream of yours!
That's just low!
Hey, Xin!
I haven't forgotten about Piao.
Great injury?
Fear not!
Yes.
Yuh!
The moon I see before my eyes
see all of Wu Qing's strategy.
And now, a wind of great history gusts from the state of Qin in the far West.
Among this rusted fear in my heart
Enemy's coming from the left!
General Biao Gong cannot predict what Wu Qing's next moves will be.
Call and Zhu Gui and Ma Gui. It's time to hunt.
Everyone, use everything you've got left!
and that Wu Gong has left the geographically advantageous hill and is now in front of us.
Thousand-Man General Fu Hushen said the same thing... Thought
was all guided by those two in order to gain victory.
General Wang Qi. Please, lend me a horse!
That aberrant charge with the general taking the lead himself...
Yes. He has narrowed his target to the soldiers in back.
Crush them to a pulp!
The height of the morale is created utterly for the reason of protecting the leader.
there were many units that could not move quickly.
Crash through the left army that's attacking the Biao Gong Army!
They're not even resisting!
The true capability of these emerging powers?
We came all the way here to be backup, didn't we?
Psychologically?
To the left!
Lord Zhu Gui and Ma Gui have been killed!
All units! Battle positions!
Biao Gong is coming!
We have twice their numbers here!
This is why we cannot stop now.
and now, much blood from both armies has spilled.
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
The general has no need for such a thing.
Lord Biao Gong! Lord Biao Gong!
I ask that you please hand down the duty to us.
but now I can see deep passion.
Were you invaded by enemies,
and the State of Wei became my second fatherland.
I see.
It's meaningless sentiment of a loser!
On the battlefield, stories of one's history have no meaning whatsoever!
But even so...
Even so...
And so, the flow of the war was decided.
3,000 Qin soldiers accompanied Biao Gong
Look!
The Wei Army is... retreating.
We... won...?
Dammit! Dammit!
But...
What's with you?
This place sure is amazing.
Don't be in such a rush.
Are you not feeling well?
Are you here to get armor for your first campaign?
Yeah. This boy...
In just one war?
Qiang Lei!
I'll whip something up for you, so come eat with us!
There is no need for...
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
There was no way I'd notice!
C-Can I ask something?
A woman pretending to be a man...! What? Like you're doing?
But, I'm a little relieved.
We're comrades, right?!
Then what is your goal?
I wanna know, too!
Diao?
Born as a Chi You, my fate was sealed.
That is what our clan is now described as.
What're you talkin' about, you old bat?
What? Do you not recognize the Chi You?
The sword was not originally something to cut people down with.
In ancient times, it was born as a sacred treasure for worshiping the heavens.
Only one!
I... don't like it.
You need to survive and take on the name of Chi You
and learn all about the outside world.
That's why,
If I can cut down ten strong-looking ones, that'll be plenty...
The festival...
Big Sister Xiang!
Targeted?
Hmph... That girl...
She is the one I can never forgive!
Man, it really got late.
You can stay here if you want, Qiang Lei.
Thought monologue begins
from talking with Wei Ping and the others.
I just kinda felt bad only listening to your story.
Xin...
So make sure you get your ass back here by the next war.
Yeah.
I'm not sure about it... but...
Then, help clean up!
In order to be greatest general under the heavens,
Will you be back for dinner?
Ancient China.
human desire was unleashed.
Among this rusted fear in my heart
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
Is there something you need, so early in the morning?
Yeah.
General Wang Qi?!
I'm turning back!
Mr. Yuan! You were told by the royal palace to help me, weren't you?
No matter how much money you have, it won't be enough.
Yes.
But now that is nothing more than a legend.
They were fine.
W-What in the world kind of maneuvers were they...
So this is the might of someone who was once feared from everywhere under the heavens. One of the Six Great Generals?!
so I ask you keep it brief.
I came to request that you teach me how to become stronger.
You have quite a commendable attitude to come request teachings.
Oh? What exactly?
I'll become strong enough to be your right hand in no time!
System?
A-Awesome. Thought
I knew this guy was Thought
the greatest general under the heavens! Thought
So then, you want to become a general, Youngster Xin?
Flashback starts
Lord Xin!
What the fuck are you doing?!
Wh-What were you intending?!
This is too much!
Subjugate it?
Protect it even if it costs you your life!
You old guys form five-man teams and attack individual enemies!
In that case, I will need to kick you down there just like Youngster Xin.
Th-This guy's a monster!
Yes! His aide!
And Mr. Yuan?!
Did you think that was enough to win?!
This can't be!
Lord Xin!
Yeah.
Everyone, follow my lead!
Breaking through the silence, a sleeping captain starts to move!
Next time,
Kingdom Episode 25 Translation by Kewl0210
It has been four months since Xin, the boy trying to become greatest general under the heavens,
And after being notified of the successive victories,
But in the midst of that great joy
swallow me.
is a truth that interrupts the rain.
those are scenes that won't disappear.
This is no time to be sitting here with our arms folded!
Got it.
Wei Ping.
A pretty decent amount of time's passed!
Long live Lord Xin! Long live Lord Yuan! Background
We subjugated the stateless area just like you said!
I've got to find Zheng and talk to him... Thought
Oh, right.
Who in the world is this guy...? Thought
The people of Mayang were all slaughtered down to the suckling children.
Leave everything to me.
and defense.
He has left the battlefield for a short while to rest his wings,
The State of Qin's strongest military commander.
You are interrupting a war council.
I am here because I was called on by that war council.
My goodness!
General Wang Qi... Supreme Commander?!
Enough, Meng Wu.
This is my decision as Commander-in-Chief.
I approve of you...
What is this, General Wang Qi?
Why are you staying silent, Wang Qi?
Does the fact that you now say you'll lead the State of Qin Army
I understand fully.
If you had seen one glimpse of the form of King Zhao,
I remembered the thing I had to tell you.
Just be careful, Xin.
No need to tell me that!
I doubt he would send his army unless he had considerable confidence.
Okay, I'm going!
He's dead!
What caused you to want to fight, Wang Qi?!
So that was why...
And...
Settle?!
That goddamn idiot!
I got Teacher's permission.
Changpingjun.
S-Special Hundred-Man Unit?
We're not attached to any large battalion,
Awesome! Is that guy really Xin?!
Xin... You...
Yeah.
Moving on, I've been allowed to assign two vice generals to this unit!
Yeah. I'll handle it.
We're going to scatter the Zhao Army,
He did this with one sentence?! Thought
Eyecatch
Pang Nuan...?
No. My enemy moved from Wei to Zhao.
Ones that do not simply bring down the malevolent gods,
War Gods?
He is, by no means, the sort of person to lead people like a military general!
completely alone.
That had nothing to do with the Zhao Army.
Not exactly.
What does that mean? I have no idea...
Advance right!
This Hundred-Man Unit accepts its mission!
in the State of Qin during the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period.
Woah! This is incredible, Yi Meng!
This many people are really gonna fight each other?
Exactly.
According to rumors, his offensive power is something to be reckoned with.
This is the power of the military commander known as Meng Wu.
Dammit! Are we still gonna have to wait for our turn?!
and having the foot soldiers take a diagonal formation
thus parrying the mounted unit's momentum.
General Wang Qi's plan?
It will turn into a severe battle,
Yes, sir.
General Wang Qi!
Feng Ji's... head!
Look! At the thicket!
but I have had similar experiences many times.
We're directly to the side of them!
And the other half
This could be an enemy trap!
Follow 'em!
Everyone, it is time for a slaughter!
Lord Bi! The right!
the spears of the heavily-armed soldiers and the arrows that pour down like rain.
nearly half of the left army soldiers fell.
But if we break there, everyone dies.
Heavy soldiers, forward!
For such a dainty-lookin' guy he's pretty good!
And the other guys in his Wu are pretty strong, too!
He's trying to pierce through the enemy formation!
the existence of the Feixin Unit attacking from the side.
Second formation?!
So that's what it is...? Thought
Interesting. If you think you can get it, go ahead and try! Thought
Emergency report!
No one can take it away,
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
We can do it! We can do it!
B-But the real problem is what comes next.
At this moment, the State of Qin's left army fight had become one sided.
But in spite of this state of affairs, Wang Qi did not move.
My eyes are... getting hazy...
But mere morale will never be enough to break through our elite guards!
If they keep up this war of attrition,
they'll eventually get worn down and collapse.
If this war of attrition keeps going, we'll eventually all run out of strength
Mr. Yuan...
And many of us are almost at our limits, myself included.
Escaping from this enemy formation would be no easy feat. Thought
Pei Lang! Tian Yong!
Bring everyone in your Wu that can fight and come with me!
We're splitting the Hundred Man Unit in two?
We'll definitely meet up again after!
We will get through!
a general leading an army also has his own fighting space.
What's come of that small unit that attacked from the side?
They got through the elite guard?!
Two to three hundred.
No, they'll come.
We got... through?
They're retreating from the 30 of us?
We're gonna be attacked from behind!
We're totally cornered... Thought
You're gonna become the greatest general under the heavens, aren't you?!
I'm sorry, Qiang Lei.
Captain!
There will definitely be a chance.
the advancement of a Hundred Man Unit is nothing more than part of that error in calculation.
If I hadn't opened both wings in order to inter the State of Qin left army,
Did that man send the left army of 10,000 charging in order to achieve that...?!
Feng Ji's love of tactics has backfired on him, hasn't it?
We're retreating!
Boy... Did your Hundred-Man Unit receive a name from my Lord?
Sorry, we'll talk later.
You've truly become a unit captain, Xin.
Won't you make a bit of a happier face?
It was to make it easier to remember.
And then I will become it... Thought
swallow me.
and the anxiety that makes me waver
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
Follow after me!
Teng, what were the Meng Wu Army's losses yesterday?
I see. Is that right?
Well, actually...
Li Bai, I know your name. Thought
Your strength lies in your defense. Thought
China acknowledges you as the General of Defense. Thought
Yes.
The Meng Wu Army's foot soldiers of yesterday are now a completely different army today.
But this will is not enough to penetrate Li Bai's defense.
Show me, Li Bai...
the ferocity of the formations you control!
Oh, they're completely surrounded now.
No matter how strong your father is, Meng Yi,
This is it...
For our army which desires to shrink the difference in numbers,
Let us think of the next move.
could not be stopped!
I know. Tomorrow, we use all armies to vanquish Meng Wu.
We will give the appearance of using the same lineup tomorrow as we did today
what do we do to deal with the other armies attacking our vulnerabilities?
Unnecessary! Tell me your business!
but at the moment, I agree with you.
The next morning...
So you're here, Feixin Unit?!
Now!
4th Army, charge!
And their aim is...
It will not fail.
Don't tell me they're going to go straight for the State of Zhao Army headquarters?
Guys, don't falter!
we ended up being the ones with our headquarters under attack...
it seems I fell short.
But with the battle in this state...
I'm looking.
Lord Li Mu...
There are visitors here already.
presenting an unprecedented crisis.
the many piled up meetings we've had
is a truth that interrupts the rain.
those are scenes that won't disappear.
we won?
The Qin Army headquarters had completed preparations for relocation.
That was because Wang Qi had stopped at this location.
Teng.
we'll merely need to uncover any plans they have... Thought
But now they're really getting close to each other...
Do you think we're just gonna...
Okay, let's get going.
Nobody's listening to you, bud.
I said I am, and I meant it!
What? Same as mine.
Huh? What's up?
Everyone has a home to return to.
But you know, Qiang Lei, it doesn't end with that.
Could it be... a Chi You?! Thought
What?! Thought
No way...
You people simply...
had no luck.
I can't speak... Thought
It's no good. I can't stand up!
Oh. It seems it was you who called me.
I don't know what that bullshit you're spouting is...
the name of the Zhao Army Supreme Commander?
We're going to avenge them, Qiang Lei!
No. This is Xin and Qiang Lei. I know they'll find a way...
I aimed to graze your cheek on purpose.
Yuh!
Yuh!
After learning that the era of saints had ended,
This is the tumultuous tale of a nameless boy and a young king who brought the warring era to its end!
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
No one can take it away,
a6I knew at the start that there's no end.
Yeah, you are!
What're you still doing, tagging along with us in the first place?
What?!
Xin!
Xin...
Couldn't he be already dead?
When you were out cold, the king ran all the way here, carrying you on his back!
We'll get to our destination before ya know it!
You're so lame!
I ain't tired or anything,
We just arrived here early.
Just watch this, Xin!
Wh-What the hell is this?! It's so friggin' delicious!
Diao!
That's such a nice story!
Awesome! I'm moved!
This guy's weak! Thought
You people from the State of Qin know nothing.
Wh-What the hell?! Thought
Xin! If you're just a sword, you'll be smashed to pieces!
he just may have appeared. Pang Nuan.
But, although I do feel it is a bit unnatural,
Shall we depart for the front?
He has unpredictable movements, changes in speed, Thought
exists for us.
I am here with you.
Stopped?! Thought
It has been a long time... since there has been someone... whose blood runs more rapidly than mine...
My body... feels heavy... Thought
That's ridiculous!
Contact Lu Wuwei as well.
Th-That's the gong for an enemy attack!
This time it's a genuine full-blown enemy attack!
Zhao Zhuang.
This night attack is completely outside my predictions,
I have not seen that power with my own eyes.
And war is something full of unexpected events...
Yes... No one knows quite what will happen in a war. Thought
and the Qin Army...
Shit!
Fire!
Our mounted soldiers total to 100!
Pang Nuan. You bastard... Thought
of Pang Nuan!
Yes, sir!
Are you all right, Xin?!
As far as numbers go, we have more foot soldiers
If we slash that guy with all our might,
We won't defeat that man by plunging in recklessly.
Even though the central and right armies sacrificed some tens of thousands, they couldn't take down the enemy.
And we'll kill two birds with one stone by also avenging our fallen comrades!
Don't count on my strength.
Though it was only dimly, I saw your fight, Qiang Lei. Thought
Right!
You bastard. Stopping me when Pang Nuan is before my eyes... Thought
What's he doing standing around at a place like that? Thought
Okay! Let's begin!
The signal!
He figured out the plan?!
That means...
What the fuck's this guy made of?!
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
Fei...xin... Unit...?
The reason for it was when Wan Ji dealt with the Fourth Army Combat Commander, Gan Yang during a one-on-one fight on horseback.
During that fight, Pang Nuan stood still for a little while, but...
Don't let a single one of them get away!
I saw Tian You pick him up, but after that...
the Feixin Unit will not die!
Why're you guys dying?
With all the echoing, I can't tell!
Xin.
You idiot. What are they going to do if the ones back here waiting for them don't even believe in them?
But... But...
He's an idiot,
Really?
But, knowing him,
one of them may be carrying another person.
It would not be odd to have died a while ago after losing this much.
Dao. Is Xin's heart still beating?
We're going to protect Xin through to the end of this.
The brats spouting about being Great Generals or whatever even though they're just servants?
D-Dammit! We'll remember this, bastard!
Awake, Xin?
Wei Dao...
Shit! What the hell am I doing?
and we said "No you won't" and we all made fun of you...?
I really think so...
Hold on a second, Wei Dao.
Wei Dao!
Over there?
Apparently Wei Ping acted as a decoy so they could escape some pursuers.
If he's with Dao... he'll be okay.
There is no need.
The captain has returned.
He brilliantly fulfilled his duty.
You did well not to die after taking that attack from Pang Nuan.
After being attacked by Pang Nuan, the Feixin Unit fled in all directions.
Meanwhile, the survivors of the Gan Yang Army were picked up by the Lu Wuwei Army.
Run!
The setting is before the common era, in the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period.
But now the enemy Supreme Commander has finally shown himself
Wang Qi Takes to the Field!
General Wang Qi went out in front!
Retreat! Retreat!
But the guys that died definitely wouldn't want that. I know it.
to render more achievements.
I thought I would finally give you a compliment,
Your posture isn't bad, Youngster Xin.
Every time they overcome them, people and units become bigger and stronger.
Otherwise, I fear everything could become spoiled.
And at Wang Qi's location...
Yes, sir. He is quite the tactician.
With things in this state, I'm worried for Meng Wu.
the battle between the Zhao Zhuang Army and the Meng Wu and the Long Guo Armies have turned into huge melee.
In the battle's opening, the Meng Wu and Long Guo Armies that raided their enemy wielded great power,
H-He ran?!
No, this is bad!
General Wang Qi said he doesn't mind if people who can't keep up break away from the group.
This war!
of the Meng Wu and Long Guo Armies that had made contact with State of Zhao Headquarters.
So, are you pushing your luck and mixing in with men to try to become a strategist or something?
That's insane!
With the Supreme Commander in front of his eyes,
But more pressing is the disappearance of Zhao Zhuang.
They went to finish off Meng Wu.
You really did it, General Meng Wu!
This man is not Pang Nuan.
Did you not?
Yang Duan He?
You seem healthy, Qin King Zheng.
Wang Qi, aware that the Zhao Army had abandoned their headquarters in order to try to finish off Meng Wu's group,
there is no way for this situation to develop into anything on a large scale. Thought
The state of the war has finally started to really shake up.
But you are here now.
We moved our troops to the place that was said to be where the Xiongnu Army's main force was gathered...
In other words, the Zhao Army forces that had been sent northward
If the Qin and Zhao armies are currently struggling for supremacy,
but if it turns out to be the truth,
Of course, that would be as enemies.
That's right.
Southeast from where the Zhao Army headquarters was left
there was an area with odd terrain.
And of those remaining, they are all wounded and exhausted.
Behind us is a sheer cliff which we cannot escape up. Thought
Does that mean that one of Zhao's Three Great Divas are there?
Mounted unit, depart!
Turn to the right!
Lord Zhao Zhuang!
Side unit, move in front of the enemy and reinforce the defense!
All units, charge!
Without retreating one step, deflect the enemy!
Incoming!
There are so few arrows...
What are the left army's archers doing?!
He may be trying to catch us off guard by attacking the headquarters,
Foot soldier unit, charge!
Yeah...
I think quite a bit of blood will be spilled,
Isn't it obvious?
Bite through the side of the Wang Qi Army's foot soldier unit!
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuous line.
Lord Zhao Zhuang!
No...
What's wrong, Lord Long Guo?
This is not Lord's usual method of fighting.
What is going on...?
That's ridiculous! I haven't heard anything about such a thing!
I'm enacting an information blockade.
It's all right, you two.
Foot soldiers!
Now we're talking!
The information blockade that Li Mu had gone so far to put in place was perfect.
then it would be the Qin Army with nowhere to go.
But as this was happening, the Qin Army military commanders were holding back different Zhao Armies among the mountains.
But!
From there, Wang Qi's thinking progressed.
That man's experience and intuition on the battlefield
if Pang Nuan is not the kind of military general that leads men,
Could it be that Li Mu knew all of this,
and made Pang Nuan carry the title of Supreme Commander?
Stop Wang Qi!
They're currently changing formations near the headquarters!
The means are a trifling matter.
Wang Qi...
All units, march!
Quit screwing around, you!
If Wang Qi is accepting this one-on-one match, then... Thought
Lord Zhao Zhuang!
It's not that simple...
In order for them to win this war, they need to defeat the headquarters.
That doesn't matter!
Anger is power.
Liao of the Six Great Generals...
Wang Qi and Liao
No... You're saying that one of the Six Great Generals was a woman?!
General Wang Qi's army has arrived!
She killed Zhao Lei and Hei Yao?!
Y-Young Lord!
And... Normal
Please... Grow up in good health... Flashback
What's wrong, Liao?
I've been hearing that name quite a bit lately.
And not long before that, Liao was formally made a general.
Liao, do you have a moment?
It's not like I could become a princess.
because when I was a child I was really serious.
Soon after she became a general, her strength was said to rival that of the Five Great Generals.
And finally, Liao was named as the sixth Great General.
Unlike someone I could mention, you've gained great success, and with that, you do not have much freedom.
For the next war, the siege of Mayang,
This next castle at Mayang will be the 100th.
No matter the era, you all are under the same misapprehension.
Pang Nuan...
Could that be...?
but seeing as the one who established the plan so far has been that man, Li Mu...
the mystery bird that made the heaven's temple
But...
will not be defeated by a something such as this.
the man known as Li Mu is an even more remarkable man than Wang Qi,
I'm counting on you... Xin... Thought
Lord Xin, what in the world is this...?
Wang Qi's prediction was that it would take another half a day before the Li Mu Army would arrive.
For them, whom had been positioned at the state's ancient and mountainous northern border, and fought equestrian tribes like the Xiongnu,
far surpassed that of what was generally known for usual mounted armies.
Meanwhile, unable to swallow what was going on around them,
is the fate of a kingdom.
Good... Thought
G-General Wang Qi's soldiers are being beaten...
Th-This is the Mystery Bird of Qin...?
It seems that I really will need for you to die here! Thought
there is no general hated by more people than Wang Qi.
that is also proof recognized by all that Wang Qi is a hero whose name will go down in China's history.
and the curtain on a new age will rise.
No matter how it happened, Lord Pang Nuan is one of the Three Great Devas.
Yes, sir!
is that it would seem I will not be able to see his end with my own eyes. Thought
I'll be going ahead and waiting for you, Wang Qi!Thought
Pang Nuan's power!
Now that that has disappeared, Pang Nuan has returned to being a pure manifestation of military might.
is really quite a chore.
He's given up!
Just as I expected of you, Pang Nuan. Thought
you cannot defeat me. Thought
but what allowed it was none other than the arrow of I, Wei Jia. Thought
Fuck you, bastard!
This is your defeat, Wang Qi.
Even my subordinates must know of anger...
General Wang Qi... Thought
It seems you don't believe me...
Then allow me to prove it to you.
like a Hundred-Man General or a Thousand-Man General.
Therefore, that existence is heavy!
and the anxiety that makes me waver
is a truth that interrupts the rain.
Report! Report!
Report!
Get in formation!
Take his head!
You're the first person I've seen manage my beloved horse, Huang, besides me.
the faces of allies.
I came to get you!
General Meng Wu!
Now that that has been accomplished, there is no point in causing any more blood to be spilled.
This war ends here!
Honestly, how troubling...
In any age, the military commanders that are called the strongest
this is why tumultuous ages are interesting.
As you can see, that is no longer possible.
To live for war,
But the group that witnessed the death of Wang Qi
The death of Wang Qi also reached the royal palace.
He does not oppress them, but shows them the same love as he would the people of his kingdom.
That is all. It is the last will I was told by King Zhao.
Of course. Because I did not tell it to him.
King Zhao entrusted me to make that decision.
Huh? What're you talking about?
But when the war ended, they let us go.
in this war, I learned how scary it is to be a strategist.
Use that time to go!
About Wang Qi.
Do you understand what that means?
Season 2 starts in June 2013.
What is wrong, my king?
who took advantage of Qin's armies being away.
The man that took the position of Supreme Commander
We've won.
Violent battles went on at all fronts,
but among them were a few remarkably lively people!
 A Shen is like a Wu, but a battalion of 10. 
The hard-faced veteran, Pei Lang.
I apologize if I am abrupt, your majesty,
We do not know the specific details, but I felt we should be cautious.
That bastard... Just what is he doing...?
Against that ambition, the current Zheng camp was so powerless to resist him
King Daoxiang is in a panic.
all he wants is someone sincere!
Hey!
In what way should I begin to please you?
Wh-What are you doing, L Buwei!?
Might I hear it?
Well, I'm not really sure.
Xin?
Many young generals from the same generation as him are appearing on the battlefield.
This is work directly connecting to victory in the war.
I get how you feel, but don't be impatient.
Those big battles aren't frequent occurrences.
This is Dong Mei!
And it's a superstition!
What's with you guys?
What?
After many successive victories,
N-No.
L-Li Mu captured two huge castles called Wusui and Feng Castle.
You may be right.
Yeah. It's just as Song Zuo says.
He's coming in person...?
But I'm certain it's true!
Then, he sent a threatening letter to Zhao saying that if they wanted the hostage returned,
Y-You mustn't, Lord Li Mu!
But I suppose we did touch the State of Qin in a sore place.
Besides, this will be a good opportunity to see Xiangyang and L Buwei with my own eyes.
What's more, this time the other party has forcibly created an opportunity for us.
What about the army?
Well, sir... In the last war, I doubted my own ears when I heard what a master of information manipulation he was in the last war.
He's finally arrived, has he?
Preparation?
Who the hell would do something so cowardly?!
How is Handan doing these days?
I believe so. I'm always out on the frontier,
But I'm sure it's become quite prosperous.
I'm glad to hear it.
To be honest, it's actually been quite suffocating.
By my nature, I am not the sort of person that stands above other men,
But for a man of your caliber, I doubt this is an unforeseen circumstance.
No.
Go right ahead.
Qin, which had a sudden expansion of power with the age of King Zhao.
And somehow, there is an odd balance between these seven states
When looking at the beautiful State of Zhao,
An alliance between the State of Qin and the State of Zhao?!
but this is not business for military men to get involved in.
But because of that, there is room for negotiating.
Hangao...
or Lord Li Mu and his comrades are all executed here.
Like this, for example...
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuitous line.
Mm. You have some talent for war.
The blowgun is a deadly weapon handed down through the Bessa Tribe of Koshi Province.
Just try it.
Huh? Something's odd.
Right now, Xin has sort of lost his edge...
That's enough. This has started to get dull.
Step back? Me? Thought
General Wang Qi, we received from you last night
all right.
Changwenjun!
Wang Qi!
There's nothing nostalgic about it!
Why have you suddenly joined the battle?
You jest.
My heart is quite delicate.
Third squadron, fourth squadron, assist the lord!
So I had my own forces stationed there as well.
And you and I can fight one-on-one!
If you think I am lying,
May I ask one thing?
Okay, let us continue...
Captain!
He probably doesn't remember it that well himself.
Thanks to those, he possesses swordsmanship even greater than those military warriors.
The emotional strength to repel a killing intent aimed at him.
Your distractions won't work anymore! Thought
I can see you perfectly! Thought
He won!
Piao is dead!
reflects this promise in my heart
a6Voice of soul
You surrender Hangao Castle and a Qin-Zhao Alliance is formed,
So, Prime Minister Li Mu, what is your reply?
Zheng...? Thought
We will be taking charge of all weapons here.
Wh-What is all this?!
Go in already.
Ah, there's a couple empty ones!
Okay, I'll be taking this seat!
the man that killed General Wang Qi is right before my eyes! Thought
L Wuwei.
As one would expect, it seems he doesn't approve of this alliance.
We're leaving!
That was really a child like this? Thought
You want nothing more than to kill me, correct?
You idiot!
My apologies, Prime Minister.
Did that child say something rude?
L Buwei's subordinate Xie Jun requested that they be given a different hostage until they received Hangao Castle.
That's quite perceptive of you.
Though I really had a rough time then,
You're still as much the charmer as ever.
Anyhow, we formed an alliance, didn't we?
You idiot! Don't say...
He Liao Diao, are you an acquaintance of his?
You know Xin?
Take care.
At that time, I'll be considering us enemies again, though.
But now he is supporting the specialist Tei Guo as a minister.
Therefore, L Buwei is sure to attempt to crush me by then.
Right, Zheng?!
That is right.
Do you mean...
Five years is plenty!
Zheng will become recognized as the true king of the State of Qin, no questions asked. Thought
Retreat!
It's like we're unrivaled on the front lines!
We haven't done anything that big.
Shut up!
Xin, the effects of the Qin-Zhao Alliance are already becoming evident.
but Xin, I decided to come here and tell it to you.
Ah, I get it.
As proof of that, in order to actually go about doing what I've been saying,
Thanks for coming all the way out here to tell me.
Check up on the units that have gathered around this area, would you?
There's no way they can get out of this, is there, Xin?
Qiang Lei, let me know your opinion on this.
Mr. Yuan, Old Man L Yan?
Push them back!
What unit is that?!
Blast through in one push!
What are you doing?! Don't let them through!
Why are you the only one?
Five years?
Go, go!
Oh? This is a surprise.
Whom is your unit affiliated with?!
What?!
Wh-Which unit are you?!
We are not the same, you fool.
What?!
On the battlefield, your proper existential value
You should focus all of your strength on your natural post.
Well, I can imagine which idiot instigated this.
If you don't, I'll drag you down by force.
At best, the highest you will get is 1000-man general.
Y-You bastard...
Yes.
The same family as your beloved Wang Qi.
Wang Ben?
What the hell was with that Wang Ben youngster?!
That there is a gigantic wall we can't climb over
Knock it off, Wei Ping.
That's nothing but an excuse, ain't it?
We suddently took a hit to our pride, and lost our morale.
We'll pay them back for every insult they gave us!
Pay them back?
we're going to need some sort of special strategy.
I have one strategy.
Did you hear, Lord Wang Ben?
It would seem that the Feixin Unit we met yesterday
went missing last night, and other units have been searching for them.
and as a result of the constant fighting, the corpses of the fallen have been left laying around.
By blending in with the corpses in that mist,
However, to slip in between rotting corpses,
we will need to be prepared for pain even greater than fighting the enemy directly.
I'm... gonna become warrior class and make my mom who raised me on her own happy!
Does your Yufeng Unit have the guts to go this far?
Run, Ang! Thought
But, all that is left is to defeat the headquarters, isn't
I don't really like Wang Ben.
This old man is beside himself.
we need a much grander strategy!
We bring you this letter.
Did you say the sovereign seal?!
I have never heard of any such a power existing here in Xiangyang.
Although it is located in Xiangyang,
Bow down!
On the path to becoming a Great General,
The harem is a third force?!
was to prevent the queen dowager's power from spreading to the rule of the country.
Mo Xi of Xia, Da Ji of Shang, Bao Si of Zhou, these three were not queen dowagers, but ruling queens.
Th-This...
Chancellor.
Which means they are telling us, the royal court, to turn our eyes towards the power of the harem.
I believe you're already aware,
Either way, they are opponents we will not be able to avoid.
I feel it may be apt to take this opportunity to prepare ourselves and attempt to win them over to our side.
but they are the venomous fangs that make up the limbs of the queen dowager!
If we just ignore this and they drift to the L Shi Faction, it would be catastrophic!
He's not saying anything about ignoring them!
Um, nothing. You just seem a little different than usual.
Do you like your mother?
That sounds like a good relationship.
Why is it that the queen dowager, his highness's mother, will not help him?
The queen dowager, left alone and helpless, was hated by all those around her.
It truly was everyone.
And... finally...
she laid her hands on her own child!
His highness has done well to recover after such a traumatic childhood.
No.
Closer.
But it's such a surprise for you to come and see me.
So, what is it you wanted to talk about?
Doing everything we could to raise money so we dirtied ourselves to be able to eat.
I was certain you had come to ask something of me.
We are now truly in a long struggle over that power.
The age of the State of Qin's King Zhao, who was feared across China as the God of War.
The states of Qin and Zhao clashed over a region originally belonging to Han, called Shangdang.
The State of Zhao's was Lian Po.
But with both armies fighting all-out in this war,
With the Supreme Commander Zhao Kuo killed, the State of Zhao Army submitted.
My mother and I were left in the State of Zhao.
It's such an annoyance!
Ah, someone's coming!
If you want some food, why don't you lower your head and beg for it?
Take that and get lost.
About Zi Xia.
The real name of that person you called Si Xia.
my life.
Lord Dao Jian...
we would have to kill you.
Understand, old Qin guy?
Are you serious, Zi Xia?!
Zi Chu?
Yes.
You understand, do you not? The importance of this?
We will decide whether or not to accept the job only after meeting with Lord Zheng.
Rotten brat!
Zheng?
Kill 'em!
Just let me go! He's not gonna die from something like this!
Stop!
She can't even really get hired, so she ended up resorting to...
To try to get out of the kingdom before the news gets to the King of the State of Zhao is already gonna be a gamble.
Your boss, Zi Xia, I believe. Where is she?
You will be going home!
Lord Zheng?!
Those guys won't even make it out of Handan.
L-Lord Dao Jian!
I swear on my name, Black Marketeer Zi Xia, that I will deliver Lord Zheng to the State of Qin.
I expected you to be surprised when you woke up and you were on a carriage.
We are planning for your mother to escape using a different path.
Do not worry.
There are five gates on this road before we escape the State of Zhao.
Pipe down. You just leave that stuff to us.
P-Please, stop!
Yes! Let them through!
Looking at him closely like this, his body is covered in bruises. Thought
What's wrong?!
Hey!
I just bought this bow yesterday, so I figured no one would mind me shooting a sack of rice...
Who ever heard of a human who didn't twitch when an arrow was taken out of their arm? Thought
Sometimes from having painful childhoods, people can get emotionally depressed. Thought
Something is happening to this child's body and mind. Thought
Sometimes I lose track of the line between dreams and reality.
I'll make sure you get there.
Who are these guys?
An emergency closure signal fire has been raised!
They just shut the gate!
This isn't time to celebrate!
He's right!
Just dump the cargo somewhere and we'll head to the state border at full speed!
You'll go home and in the distant future, when you become king, you'll be living the life of luxury!
What are you talking about?
That can't be...
As I endured that overwhelming violence...
The days of oppression continued and my heart shut tight.
You've gotta be kidding me!
The closed gate isn't gonna listen to you!
What?!
I'm the one in charge. What business do you have?
Lord Zheng!
What's with this woman?
Zheng is going with us.
Sorry for the wait.
The State of Zhao has the best pursuers in all of China. Thought
Chisong Pond?!
You haven't forgotten the promise we made when we were kids, right?!
When I was 16, I asked her to marry me.
Run, Zi Xia!
Dan Yuan!
Ya Men!
None!
You've been doing nothing but answering your own questions over and over...
You'll suffer...
Most likely about two ke.
 A "ke" is about 15 minutes. 
Dao Jian!
Dammit!
Reporting!
I thought I could save this boy, but... Thought
If I can connect this life you gave me to another... Thought
Yes, sir!
And never give up!
Zi Xia! Thought
Shit!
Please, stay still!
So they crossed the state border to get Zheng, did they?!
So... I'm sure...
Because of those difficult experiences, there is no other person like you who will become a king.
Seriously, what is it?
Xiang?
Meng Ao's army is split in three.
The chosen strategy was to have all three armies attack at the same pace.
He really knows just how strong the Feixin Unit is!
Even after all those reckless plans we pulled...
It is just as Changwenjun feared,
Now, the only thing we can do is wait.
Looking up from rock bottom at that moon, Flashback Please make sure this matches the original lines
For the power of the harem you rule
Why? Aren't they his majesty's allies? Thought
The truth is, I met with the boy just the other day.
What happens to Zheng...
Jewel of Handan...
Never utter... that name again!
from today onward, you will love this man. Flashback
The laughable ones are the king's faction.
I have to... Thought
tell his majesty... Thought
It's my turn to do the morning cleaning again today, huh?
Take a route where we won't be noticed.
Xiang was able to avoid massive blood loss thanks to the treatment from doctors of the royal palace,
Yang, we've done all we can, but...
Perhaps with the doctors employed by the queen dowager or the Three Ladies,
That... That can't be...
Xiang!
So please... your majesty... Please...
Wipe your tears, Yang.
Yang, where have you...
Please let us take over here.
She says she has something she must tell you, your majesty.
I-I'm terribly sorry, your majesty...
have formed a secret connection!
Please forgive me... for saying such things...
Thanks to you, I may have narrowly escaped death.
L Buwei... Thought
First, he split the armies into four to attack from the North, South, East, and West.
And they're mounted.
Despite how I look, I'm actually the captain of a 300-Man Unit.
Never heard of ya.
W-We are are the very end of this reserve unit.
Yeah. I can tell.
Lord Meng Tian.
Whether it was a coincidence or by design of the higher-ups,
The Yufeng Unit led by Wang Ben.
However, the actual generals have no interest in that whatsoever.
It's you?
Indeed. I can feel it.
We are attacking the East wall!
Th-The enemy was hiding a huge army of bowmen behind the wall!
and Meng Tian of the Yuehua Unit.
Wh-What?!
As I thought.
If we scale the castle walls, we have a chance at victory!
The same at the South Wall!
Shh! Not so loud!
What was that?
These are unforgivably foul rumors!
An illicit relationship with the queen dowager of all people...
That is equivalent of calling the chancellor a traitor to the kingdom!
What do you mean by that, Li Si?
Yes, leave it to me, sir!
We have already lost many people.
But for that end, L Buwei has made a major mistake.
Now, L Buwei's movements will be massively limited.
There is no turning back now! Thought
In the battles of the White Elder, a man famed for his ability to capture castles,
Basically.
I'm not sure.
But in spite of this, Meng Ao showed no signs of panic.
Meanwhile, by beating back the State of Qin Army every day, the morale of State of Wei Army soared.
Do you hear that sound?
Branches?!
General, our field of vision!
These flames and smoke will not work against us!
But Wang Ben is doing that...
Is that a... siege tower?
You've polished your unit's group combat even more.
The East Army has launched an attack.
I believe his violations were ignored.
Lord Xin, look!
Yeah...
what you can do from there, Wang Ben? Thought
Cut the shit!
Hey! Say something!
Cut the bullshit!
human desire was unleashed.
Dammit, who was it?
Course, you're not the only one in rough shape.
No, thinking about it now,
Oh? So you could say this is your land, as well.
Was there somebody here by that name?
The blowgun?
Muta's poison darts...?
too strong!
I had given up on everything. But then... Normal
Gather around the king!
I'm not too smart, so I want to to be straightforward with me about this.
it gave me a firm reminder.
Piao said that, too. I know that much!
I understand.
You understand?
somehow beat the younger brother and the chancellor,
get a land, build a house,
Acknowledged.
Even knowing of Jie Shi's rebellion, L Shi won't come back?
The one most worried about losing his majesty should be L Shi, isn't it?!
Bi... You still have yet to grasp the true fearsomeness of Chancellor L.
But my king!
And now, without joining forces with L Shi or Jie Shi,
I ain't taking it from ya, I just wanna see it!
Let me see, dammit!
To weave together my breaking heart
I gaze at the fragments of a dream No more crying
a6Voice of you
a6Voice of soul
the story of the Majiu Soldiers.
The guys who set up that smokescreen are waiting there on their horses. Thought
Lord Ben!
You truly are a terrifying person... Thought
Okay! Today we're gonna speak our minds!
I think I owe you one for that.
I don't talk with losers.
You don't play fair, you know!
Wait.
Hey, bastards!
We've been thinking about nothing but rendering achievements,
It's unfortunate, but scenes like this are sure to occur.
I'm at least smart enough to know...
We don't have to just sit by.
This is a clear violation of military law!
Get out of here,
you greenhorns that don't know a thing about war!
I'd like you to show me one army
Guys like you that spout stuff about how "this is reality"
Because everyone else does it ain't any sort of excuse!
Whether my opponent's a Thousand Man General, a Full General,
Why is he getting off scot-free and we have to go through an interrogation?!
is a matter worthy of court-martial.
We'll start with you, the vice captain.
What's more, his starting point was fatally low.
That was quite something. You protected your little sister?
It's Chun.
No, that's cool. I'm reflecting on what I've done.
I've got some free time, so I could use someone to talk to for a bit!
You've got to be kidding.
Meanwhile, the ones who gained military notoriety from this first battle
But at this point, no one had realized
Great General Lian Po!
there was actually another great battle happening elsewhere.
Why the hell is this happening?!
Yes, sir!
As soon as he took the throne,
If you do not comply, then I, Yue Chang,
Interesting.
Do you know what will happen to you if you do that?!
Does he have some sort of plan...? Thought
The central unit led by General Lian Po has been destroyed! Destroyed!
Oh, I don't plan on going back!
King Daoxiang, that's really not gonna work out.
So why the hell was I stripped of my title of general?!
Your wars were pretty good.
It seems... that these men had different roles from the start. Thought
and defected to the State of Wei.
You seem quite happy nonetheless, eh?!
Indeed, we are.
our hearts pounded and we felt like we'd fly right off the ground.
Xuan Feng!
Jie Zifang!
Lun Hu.
Makes sense, this is the third time!
And additionally... Thought
Ah! Those guys, they have rope!
Hot!
Oh, oh no!
Please just run away for now, Lord Xin!
And what's more...
And anyhow, Long Chuan, come here for a second!
Serves them right!
When I heard about your circumstances, it reminded me of my younger self.
Thousand-Man General Guo Bei, please wait.
Lord Guo Bei!
They might still be around here!
The last one I killed was Ma Gao?
Triple the security units on patrol!
Six? Thought
This assassination affair is an attempt at a counterattack by remnants of the Wei Army that
Yes, I know.
The assassins will be captured tonight and beheaded!
I thought I felt a chill... Thought
I would have given him thousands of soldiers.
It would be utterly impossible to attack military commanders of a huge force of over 10,000.
Since you cannot judge people on anything but how they look, your majesty,
Do you know of the State of Qin's Six Great Generals?
No matter how many times we fought,
The assassin is leading an ambush!
The enemy is a 300-Man Unit!
Let's get revenge...
Let go of my ha
Just how strong is this guy's grip?! Thought
Dammit!
That's odd.
You didn't balk at my bloodlust.
Xin of the Feixin Unit.
Sorry, but but I'll be rooting out any enemy that catches my eye. Thought
Hold on!
Who the hell are you?!
It's true that I'm leading a 300-Man Unit at the moment,
Th-Thirties?!
Uh... Huh?
Wait!
Captain!
Xin?
Lun Hu, a man that assassinated several Thousand-Man Generals of the Meng Ao Army,
Yes. Such as how he was different from the other State of Wei soldiers we've seen thus far.
Geezer-brat?!
All of China has recognized that Lian Po isn't coming back anymore,
Guess so.
that's all the more reason we can't let him win!
Wang Qi had heard I had defected from Wei to Zhao so he went out of his way to cross the state border to come visit.
Thank you for bringing us this news, son.
Maybe I'll pick out some liquor to bring.
Lian Po showed up... Thought
Y-Yes, we know...
And he did not defeat Lian Po a single time.
After my father moved to the State of Qin, his flower finally blossomed.
Meng Ao has an odd habit.
Isn't that the special unit that Wang Qi named? Thought
Hm, well...
To peak as an old man.
What do you think, Qiang Lei?
We will now announce them!
Meng Tian of the Yuehua Unit!
You can't blame them. They say Meng Tian was considered to have the rank of a Thousand-Man General to begin with.
When considering your skill, Xin of the Feixin Unit,
It's a decision at my own discretion.
How rude! How dare you speak to the lord in such a manner!
Therefore the Feixin Unit will gain 700 men,
But in exchange, his eye for people is unparalleled under the heavens.
By the recommendation of State of Qin Supreme Commander Meng Ao,
Ah, yes.
Look at these new 700 men.
There are mounted soldiers and all of the foot soldiers are wearing armor.
Do you think they'll be pissed about joining a band of peasant folk like us?
We are 700 men of the former Guo Bei Unit!
Got it. So please be a Vice Captain here, too.
The Meng Ao Army has the fighting power to combat it.
That is simply how big a barrier this land of Shanyang has become for expanding the State of Qin's territory.
Given your mood, it sounds like your first meeting went well.
Hey, Thousand-Man General Wang Ben!
Well, I can see how it would be less than entertaining for those that have their sights on the top. We're so young after all.
The problem is that such people exist in the upper echelons as well.
And if it's too heavy, you end up a devil-may-care type like me
How did I completely overlook these two? Thought
Was it Changpingjun that constructed this grand scheme of attacking Shanyang? Thought
Just what I would expect from him, a big move that he can only launch at this moment. Thought
Look, a tiger!
Are you an idiot?
Two, not three!
Okay, well something like this, then.
Get some booze!
What was that, Xin?! Thought
Strength tests like these aren't just about a match of who's the brawniest. Thought
Xin, could I have a moment with you?
I still vividly remember the pain from that day.
I'm putting off avenging Big Sis Xiang by staying at a place like this.
the only place I can call home now.
Honestly, I've been thinking for a while that that's what you should do.
When you said you had something to talk to me about,
All units, forward march!
So...
Let's win, Qiang Lei!
I did not think Meng Ao was someone strong enough to make you this happy, my lord.
We have awaited your arrival.
What're you talking about, Xin?
Even now that he's been employed as a general,
The heads of... every one of the inhabitants?
So he's a piece of this then, ain't he?
But without having anyone to teach him, Huan Ji was able to defeat the punitive forces
From what I've heard, that man's got a certain ambition.
Bai Guixi!
Jie Zifang!
My lord!
I pray for your good fortune in battle!
As do I, my lord!
Wh-What is this feeling...? Thought
Lian Po's not the Supreme Commander?! What's going on?!
Oh, that's unusual.
So the time has finally come.
This is a message from General Tu Men to all soldiers of the first formation!
Should we send in the second formation?!
Fifth unit! Get in formation!
So you finally got going, eh, Lun Hu?
You're slow, seventh unit!
Vice Captain Pan Yang!
The left, too?!
Assign third unit to the unit on the left!
No... This comes first.
Who the hell are you, anyway?!
General Tu Men!
I know!
So bear in mind, that means the one who's going to be targeted next is going to be your Feixin Unit!
Just... what I want. Thought
That spearmanship... You're young, but it feels so adept.
Lord Ben was born with great skill for the lance, Thought
And the snow would sublimate from his intensity. Thought
This is...
At first glance, I wasn't sure if I could dodge it or not...
Lord Lun Hu! The enemy's second formation is coming!
What?!
But within all of that, one thing stood out...
There's noticeably not a hint of coordination between the armored soldiers and the mounted soldiers.
That is at any time and against any enemy,
G-General Lian Po.
That's odd. I didn't expect the State of Wei Army's dominance to be overturned this easily.
It's a signal.
If you thought that the second formation that I, Lian Po, would send would be mere reinforcements,
Wait, the State of Wei soldiers are... disappearing?! Thought
Is the State of Wei Army intending to fight in all this?! Thought
With all this smoke, will they lose track of us, too, if we just move?
We may encounter the enemy!
You don't need to tell me every time!
Already, sir?!
No matter where you go, it'll be the same.
Qiang Lei!
and telling the bow unit where we are.
the State of Qin began its invasion of the State of Wei.
Young generals take on this relentless battlefield in hopes of rendering great military achievements.
Foot soldiers over there, run!
Xuan Feng's technique was that of manipulating the battlefield like he would pieces on a game board
Then, as the bow unit delivered strikes to the State of Qin soldiers,
Lord Xin!
Every once in a while you can hear this high-pitched bell ringing, right?
A sound signal?!
Did you just say it's a signal from the headquarters?!
the place this sound is coming from
Qiang Lei. Don't tell me you forgot...
You need not even ask.
If that is where you want to go,
Just the mounted unit will go!
It seems there is no use trying to stop you.
Send a signal to the sound units to change the bells!
You'll know soon.
Momentum alone is not enough to win wars!
Understood!
No way! Everyone's able to run like this because I'm the one taking the lead!
If we lose you here, our downfall is certain!
Fire!
It also created a large gap between them and their comrades further back.
Lord Xin!
Wang Ben...
Okay! We can still do this! Thought
They're just doing whatever they want!
If we can hold out, I'm sure...
Bastard!
We... made them retreat.
Don't be reckless!
Your blade can no longer reach that general!
It was just as Xin said.
They suffered a massive defeat without even knowing it.
But...
It's General Meng Ao!
Their two armies will without a doubt crush the enemies that oppose them,
General Jiang Yan's unit in the right army
So it's begun?!
that made Wang Qi call you "undoubtedly of the same class as the Six Great Generals". Thought
What?!
After this, the Central Army and Wang Jian Army
were in a deadlock in each of their battles
It was...
T-The contents are...
His plan has a fatal flaw.
we attack and destroy their headquarters.
This is where Huan Ji's headquarters is.
Flags  Huan
Everyone, let's go!
Just as I thought, Lord Xuan Feng's inference was correct.
No matter what little schemes Huan Ji tries to pull now, it's meaningless.
You've got some good eyes, old man.
General, something has happened to the enemy.
With the loss of Xuan Feng,
I can't say anything too soft while I'm on the battlefield, Thought
You may be ignorant,
small fry.
I can't say anything too soft while I'm on the battlefield, Thought
Well, before that,
Due to the errors in the left army, everyone is clamoring about what strategy we should take as the central army.
Lord Xuan Feng is the one at fault,
Don't worry about it.
Or about that guy's wound?
You don't need to tell me twice!
This is the headquarters where the State of Qin Army Supreme Commander, General Meng Ao, is located.
And on the left, the left army led by Wang Jian will be developing.
One could make the assumption they would head straight for the enemy headquarters, but...
but Huan Ji also made light of Jie Zifang.
Well that's fine for the left and right armies.
You really don't understand anything, do you?
but Lun Hu's movements will be connected with the movements of the left and right armies.
The expert bowman and one of China's Ten Bows, Jiang Yan,
He also boasts incredible ability to break through opposition.
and struck a blow on him.
So that Lun Hu hasn't shown his true colors yet.
If the enemy left army or right army gets behind General Meng Ao, blocking his escape route,
If stopping Lun Hu once he starts his attack is impossible,
The Yuehue Unit seems to be in a different mood than usual.
Chu Shui.
The Yuehua Unit will now be acting as an independent army
and will be leaving their post, leaving 200 soldiers behind!
the situation has majorly changed.
If something like General Meng Ao being killed happens,
Then how the hell could we ever call ourselves the greatest generals under the heavens?
I'm not as enthused about that as you two are.
Here we go, everyone!
What?!
Do you have an idea, Zheng?
This is the tumultuous tale of a nameless boy and a young king who brought the warring era to its end!
and the anxiety that makes me waver
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuitous line.
a6I knew at the start that there's no end.
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
but because it mutually benefits them all, they've also formed an alliance.
If you're slow, you're slow!
What happened?!
Those who cannot keep up can descend the mountain and wait at Duke Mu's summer retreat!
We must hurry!
Mountain People?
Got it.
That's why...
That's why they're worth allying ourselves with!
He speaks...
Our language?!
How do you know we're here to meet the Mountain King?!
Xin!
Please wait! We could never descend the mountain, leaving our king alone!
Hangu Pass is an important barrier protecting Qin's Eastern border.
It would seem that Jie Shi and L Shi have begun preparations for all-out war.
Yes. Quite a difficult task.
surpass King Zhao! Flashback
Are you crazy, old man?!
nor the past where we laughed together
Sadness is sure to turn into strength
a6Voice of soul
the State of Qin began its invasion of the State of Wei.
They divided a mere 800 soldiers into five groups? Thought
No, wait.
Sir?
B-But sir!
I know you're the most talented of these three generations of the Meng family... Thought
What's going on here?!
But of course, he cannot break through a few hundred or a few thousand enemies on his own.
We also must consider his soldiers that he always takes into battle.
However, this is more of a preparatory move than anything.
We, the Yufeng Unit fought with him on the first day.
bearing that in mind, the ones to suffer the most damage from challenging them
Why don't you call for a sortie, Lord Xin?!
So Wang Ben, Xin, I'm counting on you to take care of the rest! Thought
If we lose any more manpower, we may be completely routed!
Send in a fresh supply of Wei soldiers to fill in the gaps.
I never thought they'd be going for my soldiers to start with. Thought
They're my precious arms and legs, but they're limited in their numbers. Thought
The enemy is visibly slow in reacting to us! Thought
We're going to slowly retreat as well!
They're running!
And what's more, these thee units that were so hostile before are suddenly acting together as allies. Thought
Get out of our way!
Soldiers clad in white...!
Kill them all!
These are Lun Hu's final soldiers that form a shield around him.
The rest aren't keeping up at all!
What?!
Don't mind us, just take Lun Hu's head!
The Feixin Unit... is going to need that man in the future.
The worst blow today
But that's all.
And including that spear user over there,
Did you think that between the two of you
Quit your bullshit, bastard!
Woah there!
Don't underestimate me.
So, then what about you?
That means you're also going to surpass my lord, General Lian Po!
The enemy blocking their way is the legendary Great General, Lian Po.
They're breaking us apart!
Don't relax yet!
I'm the man that inherited General Wang Qi's lance and his will from him!
His wound is opening... Thought
It seems to me that there're two types of generals.
The general that becomes a pawn on the battlefield himself,
But I'm aiming for something even higher.
What?!
In other words, this area is hard to attack and easy to defend.
This is bad.
That is because the eyes this general stares at us with Thought
Thousand-Man General Bi,
As you created a camp here and are repelling the State of Wei Army as you are,
we could take them down from the high ground.
The enemy of 10,000 could be cut in half.
Yes, sir!
As you have commanded, the Bi Unit will attack the Jiang Yan Army!
Lord Wang Ben isn't even in their battle anymore. Thought
We no longer have any time. Thought
I can't hear my subordinates' voices. Thought
We have no time left to defeat him.
Retreat formation!
It ain't gonna happen!
Don't let them get away!
It may be prudent to retreat for now and regroup.
There's no need for that.
Is this wound... because of a blunder? Thought
I grant you the rights to lead them.
Bi!
and attack the Jiang Yan and the State of Wei Army!
There's nothing Jiang Yan can do! Thought
If one enters by the somewhat gentle slope on one side,Thought
We can't! It's so crowded up ahead we can't move!
Could it be that he...? Thought
Enemies from the rear!
What?!
General... Wang Jian!
I have gained control over the top of all of the the cliffs.
We're going to be slaughtered!
From this point onward, work for me.
They didn't come here from somewhere far away.
And so he could defeat us, having chosen this place as the battlefield as he predicted,
Just what the hell is this battle?! Thought
It is beyond the realm of humans.
Truly a monster.
You did just what I predicted, Wang Jian!
Those of the State of Qin and of the State of Wei,
There's no doubt about it...
the appearance of Lian Po
Right now, the State of Qin Army has the advantage on this enclosed land! Thought
I see! The reason why Lian Po was able to get here so fast when he was supposed to be at the headquarters, Thought
Which would you say was the most heated?
But which would you say was the hardest one to fight?
Bai Qi was a general that never risked danger.
suddenly reminded me of Bai Qi.
And losses brought from an unprepared siege on a castle are harsh. Thought
Got it.
Forget Yan Jiang, I don't understand anything about you... Thought
I had a lot of hardships against Bai Qi's defenses,
in this battle, he sees himself the top of the State of Qin Army.
Wang Jian, I understand the reason why you never let the light of the sun touch you ever since the age of King Zhao. Thought
Jiang Yan! I'm leaving this place to you! Thought
What will you do, my lord?
Sounds like Tu Men and Rong Bei had something to say to you.
Normally, yes.
even I cannot retreat.
They're proof that you survived, your majesty!
A secret medicine handed down through my clan's village.
And I also...
Not that convenient, eh?
Instead of worrying about that, think about tomorrow.
And even your bones were cut!
Today, we're really gonna crush the State of Wei Army!
Now for a fresh start!
Young generals take on this relentless battlefield in hopes of rendering great military achievements.
But General, what about the morale we worked so hard to raise!
So basically, general, you're giving us permission to...
and has prepared for an attack on the State of Wei Army.
At the right wing is General Tu Men.
But I wonder how well those heavyweight-class soldiers will be able to keep up with my fighting style. Thought
Yes, sir!
I need everyone to fight with the fury of desperation.
Mr. Yuan, can you see Lun Hu?
hitting Lun Hu is still going to depend a lot on luck. Thought
The right-wing enemy is turning in... the opposite direction?! Thought
Stop them!
Oh no. The target of that wheel movement is... Thought
Just keeping up with him is taking all of our soldier's stamina...
Okay, let's go, you bastards! Thought
Wait, Feixin Unit!
No! This is an order!
Qiang Lei, I'm leaving leadership of the people here to you!
Lun Hu!
You'd best not make the mistake of thinking I'll be weaker today than I was yesterday.
Promise?
But you can't send a large army to the back, right?
O-One on one?!
Is he being serious?!
There's no way Lord Meng Ao would accept something like that!
Hurry!
The reason I gave Bai Guixi the title of Great General Thought
I'm not concerned.
We have too many mounted units. Have half of them get off their horses.
Shield soldiers should move forward to block arrows.
My lord!
We drifted all the way here? Thought
The forest on the side has already fallen into the enemy's hands.
got up the first step that easily?!
What is this?
and becomes a "strong general", one that attacks with lethal force.
In those situations, it's not uncommon for him to lead a formation himself.
Now... Thought
Oh, nothing.
but for Meng Ao, this is his first chance at vindication in several decades.
All right! Raise the flags!
The path the general is pointing us in can't be wrong!
After that, I just had to reshape it. Thought
that something's going on at the headquarters behind me. Thought
He did an excellent job stopping my charge. Thought
It's partially because of my depletion of soldiers, Thought
His fighting strength aside, Thought
Xin of the Feixin Unit.
When you're fighting on horseback, a sword wound to the thigh is fatal.
Everything that was in the way... is gone! Thought
Captain!
Fire at will!
Spearmen, forward!
Knock every last soldier of the State of Qin Army down to the bottom of these cliffs!
Lian Po split the soldiers under his command into two groups
and led the group of soldiers he was leading onto a different path.
Impossible! How did he get through so easily?!
many roads became easily passable roads.
And furthermore, because we tried to focus our manpower around the traps in order to take out the enemy in one blow
The enemy's already reached the 8th level!
But my lord, even if he does have those obstacles...
The roles of those armies are simple and clear.
But... Wang Jian is halted at that rear fortress
Hurry!
I really can't afford to leave my position in conditions like this. Thought
Lun Hu reflexively cut him down.
Xin!
My lord is... waiting.
It was fate.
Picked up? By Lian Po?!
By the Great General, Lian Po!
The fighting genius being adopted by the great fighting genius.
And one of those, Lian Po,
Wei Ping.
And in his place... I met another out-of-this-world person.
was arranged by the heavens as well? Thought
Leave them to us!
I can't see any sign of people in the area where we left Vice Captain Qiang Lei and the others.
I-In this rain, it's pretty hard to see from...
but it's hard to tell much from here.
Shut your mouth, you bastard!
If you stick close to idiots, their stupidity will spread to you. Flashback
Shit. Where are Vice Captain Qiang Lei and the others?!
but I'll make sure I get my revenge. Flashback
Everyone around here is huge.
Did you... finish?
Q-Qiang Lei is a woman?! Thought
Don't tell me you knew that Qiang Lei was a woman the whole time?!
Why didn't you say anything?!
We want an explanation!
It doesn't matter if she's a woman or not at this point.
That's everything for her.
It's definitely eventually gonna leak to the enemy that she's a woman!
Well, he's got a point.
their morale raised from being invaded won't easily be broken.
Yeah.
Yes, sir. They've lost morale after having heard of Lun Hu's death,
Lian Po is coming!
Lord Ben, what do you think?
We must not let a single one of the State of Wei's soldiers climb the hill to our headquarters.
The fact that they keep concentrating on me Thought
Hurry, that way!
A-Are you intending to fight him one-on-one?
Well, yes.
And so, now that I've got this chance, I thought I'd like to talk to you a bit on horseback.
What exactly did you think you could do with skill like that, Meng Ao?
It is not skill.
and in the end, I never had one victory.
And then...
How happy that made me...
When the Six Great Generals passed away, my flame went out?
but I pray for his good fortune in battle. Thought
So that's the headquarters of the Supreme Commander Bai Guixi, eh?
Yeah, just like General Wang Qi, I can definitely feel an insane "pressure" just from him standing there. Thought
Wang Qi was killed.
Even if he had been away from the battlefield for a long time,
He was a fool that sullied the name of the Six Great Generals and the Three Great Devas.
Nonsense, that can't be!
But like hell I'm backing down! Thought
That boy was present at Wang Qi's end
This kid got Wang Qi's lance? Thought
And if you're so inclined, I'll send you to Wang Qi.
Who is that bastard?
That's... no ordinary fire.
All of the State of Wei guys down there have surrendered.
Good.
We dragged Jie Zifang around to the middle of the mountains.
I led a separate unit of 4,000 on my own accord.
I kinda don't feel like this anymore.
Hey, Zhong Gui, take him away.
A lot of my subordinates are waiting for you on the other side!
That's the pride of a soldier for ya.
Now all that's left is to see what's going on over there.
W-We did it! We won!
Out of the way!
And what's more... it's to a nameless servant boy. Thought
Opening
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
I don't really care, but if you don't hurry it up, we're leaving you behind!
And even if they call it a country,
I even had special training for this sorta thing with Piao!
Tajif the Warrior?
A boy king with no political power...
Would you let me hear your reasons?
What the people of the State of Qin did to us!
But we realized that it was an illusion.
but they were still met with relentless torment.
why getting rid of those is a nearly impossible task.
To think that the appearance of one person, Duke Mu, would make hundreds of years of discord disappear, is naive.
That is not what I say.
And if you say that simply cutting off my head will resolve it, you are mistaken.
it is because they are divided that strife is created.
But that happened in the distant past.
Inside and outside, who is a friend and who is an enemy has become defined even more strongly.
What the hell do you know about Duke Mu?!
No!
I will unite China and become its first king!
Unite...
Just the kind of question I would expect from you, Lord Yang Duan He!
To capture Qin, the Mountain Countries require further power.
Everyone is happy that the first king uniting the Mountain World in hundreds of years has been born.
Although you know the malice held by the elders towards the people of Qin is deep...
You bastard! Who're you callin' pig food?!
Seriously?!
Not like we'd find anybody... Thought
Oh, well!
the royal palace may become a sea of blood.
That's how it was taken from me.
we will now go to take back the King of Qin's throne that was unjustly taken!
Sadness is sure to turn into strength
Let's do it, General!
With the central army having lost Lun Hu, it's now powerless.
If we're considering the best interest of the State of Wei, we must avoid that at all costs.
General!
I will promptly retreat the State of Wei Army!
Make sure you don't loosen the reigns on Huan Ji!
But there aren't any scribes or anything. He's doing it in this situation?
You should be thankful that you're getting out of this with your life!
S-So then...
In other words, at this moment, the State of Qin's victory was decided.
That means that you are someone that chases after Wang Qi,
And then you need great experience and great luck!
The State of Zhao Three Great Devas and the State of Qin Six Great Generals had all of those things.
Do you seriously think you can become my equal?
I told you, didn't I?
Yes, sir.
Blow away the legends.
The uniting of China.
Thanks to me!
We're going home.
You should rest here.
Xin, is that you?
He's not breathing?!
Who rendered the big achievements?
Yes, sir. It was general Huan Ji sending this information.
Oh. That thief did, eh?
You did it, Xin! Thought
Though on the way there, many wounded soldiers passed away before they reached their destination.
And there was one person saying goodbye in a different way... Thought
Aw man, I can't take it! Thought
Hey man, your face is bright red!
Uh, so...
Old man Lu Yan said he'd be awake after resting three days.
Tomorrow, before dawn, I'm leaving.
A long time ago, I used to do things like laugh and cry,
Well, anyhow, I'm going.
Xin!
Lord Xin! Captain!
Geez, you two really haven't progressed, huh?
Well, I suppose wearing armor is allowed, so perhaps that would be acceptable.
He's done well to make it this far in such a short time. Thought
You idiot!
The Vice General that slew an enemy staff officer and the enemy Supreme Commander, General Huan Ji!
We've been waiting for this!
For this war, he had temporarily been promoted to the rank of Thousand-Man General.
Ah, uh, yes, sir!
Ah, this isn't going well.
it was all they could to do quell the laughter welling up inside them.
So my war will be restarting again, soon.
I wonder who will be present at the next distribution of honors ceremony?
Something great no one's ever done before? Flashback
Then we've gotta go at it with full force!
Let's do it, Zheng!
The same as usual.
By the way, Lu Xian,
Due to their consecutive defeats,
We lost again.
Quit screwing around, Ang.
Who decided it was the strategies that've been the cause of all this?!
H-Have you really been fighting with this strategy?
I'm impressed you haven't been wiped out.
Anyhow,
But the fact that you haven't had all that many losses is only because you haven't come up against any strong enemies!
Quit screwing around!
Don't just go calling your little brother to us!
Did you not hear about it?
Th-Then what about the Feixin Unit's strategist?!
A representative?
All right, we're here.
Okay.
Diao... So even you
Fuck off, creep!
What?! Even you've come here...?
In that case, it might not even be worth doing... Ah well.
Ah, that goes here.
Along the cliffs!
But to be honest, I don't know just how much you can do right now.
You look kinda like how my wife back home looked in her younger days.
Ah, what the hell?
Report!
The Long You Unit is requesting aid as well!
If they're having trouble, then just have them retreat to the thicket behind them and regroup.
If the enemy catches onto that, it's likely they'll attack those areas with full force.
But we haven't gotten any word from them at... Thought
The Pei Lang, Chong Yuan, and Tian You units are breaking down!
What?!
That's odd. Knowing Feixin Unit Xin's character,
If we find them, crushing them will be an easy task!
the Feixin Unit headquarters was following Diao's instructions
I still haven't done anything. Thought
She already received master's special strategist approval.
A strategist's hostility is always tested on their first campaign.
Diao, the enemy's in sight!
But this is different! Thought
Got it!
Send the Dao Qing Unit forward.
The Feixin Unit headquarters got behind us before I had laid out my encircling net Thought
Yes, ma'am!
And this is an elite unit! Thought
It's all right!
The enemy vanguard!
but there are a lot of forked paths in the State of Wei's way!
Lord Dao Qing!
Tian You Hundred-Man General!
No need to worry.
He Liao Diao!
Before our headquarters falls, you've got to take out the enemy headquarters... and win! Thought
But for the most part, the method used in actual battle
But it is because of that sacrifice that it brings about such a tremendous result.
Seems they didn't have much of a strategist after all.
No, forcing their way through is a fine strategy.
And one strategy you can be almost sure to find in the endgame is forcing one's way through.
Hey now, Bing Gui, you're praising them an awful lot.
Lord Xin, enemy reinforcements are flooding in!
R-Right!
You must still be okay if you're able to fling insults!
Enemy reinforcements are coming!
She said because it's a suppression battle, or something.
Awesome!
Man, what's with this girl? She's really something!
I will not accept it!
Hey,
If that's the case, then her plan was really awesome because it used the Feixin Unit's strengths to its fullest potential, right?
No, I can't!
dozens of people could die.
I've got to refine my plans.
You don't need to burden yourself with the number of dead.
Like hell I can't!
And I think I displayed that at least in that first campaign.
Whether it's an ally or an enemy, you can't measure just how much blood and tears are flowing...
That's why the weight on our backs gets a lot heavier when we win.
Yeah, you didn't!
Never mind, c'mon!
She's here!
Yes. With no more enemies to defeat in Lijing,
In the battles where they captured Lijing,
It-It's the Yufeng Unit.
The usual state of things is that taken land quickly gets taken back again.
No.
Is Chu on the move somewhere?
The State of Yan's army is the same size. 100,000.
So it's a battle of 100,000 VS 100,000?
Just what sorta kingdom is Yan?
The war between the State of Zhao and the State of Yan is over.
He saw through Li Mu's strategy and launched a counterattack.
Because Chu is so wide, it borders Qin, Han, Wei, Zhao, and Qi.
The Shanyang Dongjun Declaration was a sign that those plans are progressing.
For real?
Ah, sorry...
What're you doing at the crack of dawn, bastard?!
But still, we're on the front lines of an invasion to the East.
Did you come to?
Hey, whose castle is that? Chu's? Wei's? Zhao's?
My name is Xiu.
Please... help... my mother...
A-Are you sure about acting on our own like this?
With the rumors of his relationship with the queen dowager
it was L Buwei's camp that lost power.
Well, now the matter is settled.
Sir.
He's finally made it this far...
Open the door.
Be quiet, Changwenjun.
So the seat of Left Chancellor is vacant...
Everyone collapsed around here are children.
So the only one that got away... was this kid?
Mother!
Mother!
Yeah!
There are at least 2,000 Han Army soldiers.
Got it!
It's no good, Elder!
We can't hold out any longer!
Is this the end? Thought
Xin, be careful!
His skill at mounted battle has gotten remarkably better!
will not show you any mercy!
and in exchange, they offer you protection.
Will you be all right without us?
I don't think we will have any attacks for some time.
The younger brother's subordinates...
For them to come forward like this is...
But joining hands with your former enemy like this...
So I suppose the victor will be the one with the stronger poison?
That is also wrong.
You rotten young king... Thought
I'm planning on giving some long, drawn out speech!
Don't fucking forget that!
They're different... Thought
Ang, you bastard... You're a friggin' foot soldier!
Right now, I must find You Lian and avenge Big Sis Xiang. Thought
something else that gave Xin and the others reason to celebrate became apparent.
Now the foundation of the State of Qin is building into a prosperous and solid stone.
Three days from now, how about we hold a national celebratory banquet?
Therefore, I must mercilessly eliminate all those that block my path. Thought
The Feixin Unit's Xin?
Shut up and walk!
What the hell?! Don't poke me with that!
because of the Qin-Zhao alliance, you cannot lay a hand on me.
It's Xin.
Lord Li Mu!
There's an interference.
It must be a secret conference for a new alliance.
Hypothesizing the worst-case scenario is the proper thing to do as a strategist, He Liao Diao.
Just hearing it makes me shudder.
With Wang Qi's death and General Meng Ao being injured and effectively retiring after that last war,
There's going to be a storm across all of China...
A big war is better than anything we could ever ask for.
Zheng, our king, said this.
So no matter what kind of storm arrives, we'll overcome it!
And that is the path to becoming the greatest general under the heavens!
All armies, depart to the field with the preparedness to fight to the death!
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years...
This is the tumultuous tale of a nameless boy and a young king who brought the warring era to its end!
I am pulling them, dammit!
I haven't committed any acts of "treason".
Procedure?
That's gonna take forever, isn't it?!
But the prisoners who were Changwenjun's subordinates...
Actually, we've already started moving to capture Changwenjun's close relatives,
Who?
But you absolutely must bring me Ying Zheng's head!
Yes, I'm quite worried, your highness.
And that lord is approaching.
Wait, you guys made me ride the wild horse on purpose, didn't you?! Hey!
Me, too!
Everyone's really fired up right now!
So Jie Shi has started to make his move?
It seems that in the past few days, he has gathered 80,000 soldiers at Xianyang.
There's something we need you three to make before we depart.
It would seem the preparations for the plan are going smoothly.
Zheng!
What're we using these things for?
I did special training for that with Piao from all the way back!
We're preparing for departure!
Just imagining it makes me want to vomit!
praised you quite a lot, didn't he, Lord Chengjiao?
Lord Ying Zheng?!
I never heard that I have a brother!
But now, she has been taken as the king's legal wife,
But Mother's illness was real. Thought
No. Nothing.
Xin... Piao... Thought
We've finally made it.
Yes.
a6I won't fear
until over one hundred states were reduced to merely seven.
And now, a wind of great history gusts from the State of Qin in the far West.
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
Can you see the especially large building in the center?
Those are...!
He then returned to the crowd.
They sure are taking a while!
They're opening it.
It is not 3,000.
And finally, we'll become the greatest generals under the heavens!
They have many tribes.
It seems they will only let the king and 50 envoys with her past this point.
We must defeat Chengjiao and Jie Shi before that happens.
So all those outside the gate will watch over all of the exits
It's too late now.
D-Do you think it's gonna start already?
I can barely walk..
What is going on with you guys?!
Kill! Kill them!
They'll target you!
But those walls are so tall that you'll never get up them in one bound!
Form a base close to the wall! Form a human ladder and cross over it!
But we have no other choice!
Jiang, choosing Zhugui Gate as the checking station
there's no point in fighting in a place like this!
There's a huge old man up here.
Ooh, here they come.

The air raid on the 20th has been claimed as
He announced the launch of an astonishing project.
On the inside, it is a heavily fortified and guarded structure,
Please make your decision.
''Your wish shall be granted.''
Hey, Shizuku.
You probably want to ask how I'm feeling right now.
Oh fine.
Film the scenery.
Ouch!
an8But how could this have happened?
In a moment, representatives from our company will come to guide you.
Should I get some of the scenery?
Welcome.
Come on.
Please proceed to the front reception desk.
I'm not sure if I should say this...
"Leave the rest to one pure of heart."
Please leave everything to ALICE and sleep without worries.
May I ask something?
To be specific, it deals with the pattern of electrical currents generated by the brain.
Doctor, hurry to the chapel.
Well then, it is time.
God doesn't exist, does he?
I'll be waiting for you, always.
If I wish, a miracle will happen...
I'm...
Every time I look in the mirror, I'm sure I'll remember you.
And when I turn forty, you'll be forty...
I will be taking care of you.
What year is it now?
Hello? Hello?
Hey you, are you okay?
NO!
Fool.
Already tried.
Huh?
But...
Let's go up.
We can't do that! I don't want to leave anyone else behind.
What happened to her?
Ah, what a mood killer.
Like I said, we just need to go up and check out what happened to the world!
Check?
What? What's this?
You shut up! Don't order me around!
How do you know that?
Something else from your game?
Its eyes can barely see anything, so that monster relies entirely on its ears.
Didn't I tell you? That thing only reacts to noise.
That girl!
What?
What's got you so on edge?
Stone?
Damage sustained, but the adventure continues!
But I really wish I could have switched out a party member...
I'm really sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Do you, amigo?!
I snuck it in.
Then why did you tell us to come here first?
You come after me, and the girl dies.
Use the emergency stairs there to get outside.
Hey, you're not gonna...
Just help me out with my studies, 'kay?
Hey now.
Why can you be so calm?
Shizuku!
With this, I've returned the favor.
You owe me one.
Hey, what are you doi...
Idiots.
Holed up in this place without any sunlight?
Bastard, who the hell do you think you are?
So cool! You're like True Commando!
I already thought that this epidemic and cold sleep was something out of a dream.
A monster?
Let it in. I'll finish it off with a single shot.
Please don't shoot.
What happened?
What's it like outside?
The problem was the odd creature that appeared in the village around the same time.
The only person in the entire world who realized that was me.
Unbeknownst to all, humanity is being played for a fool.
The feelings she had when she stiffly squeezed the hand I held out...
You said you could control our dreams during cold sleep.
She had fearsome abilities of propagation.
Stop!
BOY!
Go! This one has a crush on me.
Sorry...
Boy!
It doesn't matter what...
I'll become a hero and make Papa and Mama make up!
Tim!
I'm okay, Miss...
To Level 0, the top of the tower.
You idiot!
Fly Tim and I as far away as possible.
As long as I stay alive,
I came here with that in mind.
It's got more than just wings.
The prince in her dreams can be reshaped over and over, but the prince from reality exists differently.
Mr. Owen!
Level 0 is like one of those black boxes.
I can feel it.
And last is the ultimate soldier incapable of dying from Medusa.
Relax and count along with me.
Between these extremes sits a delicate balance.
By the way, what is yours?
How is she showing me this?
Did you not realize that coming back here was a futile effort?
Three years ago in New York, she jumped to her death, smashing into little pieces.
Did you lose someone precious, too?
Miracles don't happen without wishes.
If I wish, a miracle will happen...
Live.
Marco...
You just don't.
I'll put an end to this nightmare!
Shizuku.
Please, let's jump together.
Stop means stop!
A dream belonging to some evolved being from long ago.
Miss?
Where?
shouldn't we do a quick introduction first?
Starting today, we'll be filming this movie for real.
Network.
Clouds.
i1There is a future.
i1There is a tomorrow.
i1and were sent to the future
i1Of course, it's roaming now.
i1In the same way, no matter how fast a train went, it could never fly.
It'll be a bit hard to feel the distance next time...
Is the owner out?
But what happened here?
If they didn't, they wouldn't have left such an open area alone.
Then what's this building for?
There's one thing...
We're going to catch them?
Capture.
Yeah, why do you ask?
To save the mankind.
Oh, I see.
They had more people around.
It'd be a big help if those people in the past would just change the future already.
It's a fantasy that says when the past is changed, a different future from our own is born.
Buildings would rise from the ground like trees, and...
Why corn?
You really like movies.
No, I'm not talking about that.
It's last night's conversation again.
Oh yeah...
Look.
Keyword.
Raccoon.
Herb.
A time traveler from a different time than ours could have come before us.
Hm, maybe we don't look like prey?
Don't say you don't care!
It's been a while, Sakyouyama.
Guess we'd better prepare for a tear-jerker!
She always writes her letters so roughly.
i1We've always been in the dark.
Did you time travel here, too?
I'll explain that after you see it.
This is what you wanted to show us?
Oh, we're already rolling.
Hello, everyone!
Close, wasn't it?
If one's afraid of the river, one builds an embankment.
You're not going to say that you think they built the tower to replace God, are you?
It's our job, after all.
Please.
I see.
In our generation, it collapsed!
Of course, we'll start building it again!
Tell me honestly!
Hey!
So, where are we going next?
Something like that.
Soshite tabi wa owaranai
Sometimes I wonder... Am I a hopeless, foolish, petty person?
I want to learn more and more about them,
there will be plenty of hardship and sadness lying on the road ahead.
Maybe I'm traveling to understand that more.
We still have a long way to go tomorrow.
That's totally wrong!
I'd love to have him teach me a few things.
Yeah, probably.
A three-day stay, huh?
Will you be bringing that motorrad into the city?
Meaning?
Hermes, do you feel like waking up yet?
Everyone ought to give travelers a bit on the house.
That's...
Oh? When?
How was it?
How far will you be going?
Thank you very much for today.
As of now, I'm a citizen of this country!
But you're not acting like it.
Shit!
I'm sure of it.
What the hell's with you all?!
You mustn't do that.
Here, in this country,
You see, in this country,
Looks like someone's there.
To be honest, Hermes,
There are plenty of other roads to take.
True.
I hope so.
How many days are you planing to stay?
No need.
Thanks for coming!
Is there a hotel with a shower that's not too expensive in this area?
Hello. I'm Kino.
It's right over there.
And now?
But my friends often tease me over it, calling me "Okra" or "Sockura."
It's not something I can really explain.
It's awfully different from the rumors.
It hasn't been long since we started,
Great idea!
Long, long ago, a persecuted people were driven out of a distant country.
No country will take our people in!
Mommy, I'm scared!
We wouldn't want your clothes getting dirty.
That so?
Huh?
Come on!
I always promised myself I'd show it to our guests if we ever had any,
Same here.
Don't you think being able to help make that happen is wonderful?
I'm going to study here and become the best tour guide here.
Normally people don't get married until after they're 20.
The bride and groom are going to throw lots of little bags.
Nothing. I just kind of...
Be sure you reach the top of the ridge before you stop to rest.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much for staying here.
Kino, what's wrong?
What?
It's a corruption.
There was no time for them to escape.
Abandon our country or stay.
We don't know any other lands.
We don't know any other way to live.
Sakura knew nothing.
But last night, she told us she wanted to inherit the inn.
Either way, the two of you couldn't both ride me.
Yeah, looks good on you.
Let's sing.
in the country where I was born.
My name's Kino.
Thank you.
Well, I can't go as fast as a motorrad by myself.
Why don't we think of a name for him before he comes to?
What was your old friend called?
Hermes.
This is good. Thank you.
We'll open up your heads and remove the child from you.
something is always waiting for us.
Pretty bad, huh?
So that you might be happy.
Is there a way I can stay who I am and become an adult?
You fool!
Apologize to your father!
What is this?
Y-Yes, sir.
Farewell.
Why are you holding a kitchen knife?
This girl has rejected our great surgery
so they naturally have the right to dispose of any faulty product.
First, climb onto the seat of the motorrad behind you.
Grip the handlebars in both hands.
And when I do that,
It's more stable if you squeeze the tank with your thighs.
Thanks.
Hmm? Kino.
Nice name, right?
Yeah, I like it.
Hermes.
So, what do we do now?
Uh, Kino, I've got bad news.
What about you, Hermes?
All right. I'll see you later.
If I get too hungry,
Then he climbed out of his car to try to escape,
I'll be making use of your car and persuader.
But there's no way to escape from here!
Boy, you're putting on quite a show, Kino.
Hermes!
Hold on a moment.
Huh?
That was a joke to lighten the mood!
Divorce papers?
You alive, Kino?
Hey, stand me up now!
It's not like you were going to eat me.
Oh, that's right.
What'll you do, Kino?
In other words, Hermes,
So?
Thinking about complicated stuff makes me tired.
We'll start the sequel when I wake up, so hang tight until then.
Goodnight, Kino.
and even if I have to kill others, I still want to continue doing it.
We still have a long way to go tomorrow.
Yeah, of course.
That's what makes it strange.
Here's a little extra for you.
Enjoy.
Hello.
--The tea here is always so good.
I'll be setting off today, after this.
I don't know.
Thank you very much for today.
You!
On the motorrad!
' decline.
What?! You coward!
I thought my frame was going to break.
See? Over there.
Here '5 where I am
If you refuse the match, you live your life as a slave.
Fortunately for them, they drew each other for the first round.
But the husband died in the next round.
Seven years ago.
Well, it's a dark, cool place with the right humidity.
I know you're angry,
Every now and then, I should use my abilities to the fullest.
What happens if someone's hit by a stray bullet?
That's one of this country's rules.
It's no use.
' yield.
Why are you doing that?
I heard about this country from an old man today.
Sort of.
I got the gist of it.
Yeah, that's right.
Will you yield for me?
--Drop dead! --Wh-What have you...
It's been a long time.
Thank you.
You're the prince?
Honestly, I was planning to cut that man down when I won and received my medal.
Revenge...
I'm Shizu's loyal servant, Riku.
l was taught not to go wandering off after strange men.
Our destination: here and there
That's something to look forward to once we're inside.
It's an ordinary house.
Shush.
Yes!
First, there's this.
They're all wonderful items that show
And this was his favorite helmet.
Then...
This place... is hell.
Hey!
Why not give it a try?
I'm sure she'll come home someday.
We rarely get travelers out here.
What's his deal?
Sorry, Hermes.
If you don't, your skills will get rusty before you know it.
That automatically grants you the right to participate in the fights.
Are you planning to charm your opponents with your cute f
It was after the current king took over for the old one.
About?
So that's His Majesty, huh?
Also, we'll be staying here tonight.
Care to have some fun with this older lady later?
After bottling his rage for all those years,
but they grew accustomed to having easy lives and doing anything they wanted.
Were you listening?
He's incredibly skilled.
Please yield to me now.
Wow. So?
So...
Die!
Wh-What have you...
you should leave this country at once.
What is it, Hermes?
You should definitely stop by that country, Kino.
For the past seven years.
You're welcome.
Hmph. Pervy dog.
I know it's not my place to ask, but...
All right. Then this is farewell.
Yes, take care. You too, Riku.
Hmph!
Hey, Kino!
Yeah.
Here '5 where I am
And there '5 where you are
I'm hungry!
You'll catch the stupid!
What a wonderful story, right?
What do you think of us?
"You must not hate others, no matter what."
I'm sure the priest...
People can love each other and live life respecting each other.
I will never resent, hate, or kill anyone. Not ever.
She's crazy in the head.
We picked a bunch!
Slave!
--I refuse to live that life, no matter what happens. --Or else you'll go without dinner!

I saw her!
Father, was I wrong?
I'm sorry, Mother.
Father, I need to talk to you.
What do you plan to do with her?
I want to become a great man who can fight and protect everyone.
Thank you so much!
Wh-What happened?
It's my fault they're all dead!
Huh?
Yes. Then place your right hand around the narrowest part.
You're quite the clever strategist.
You're free now.
And not noticing the poisonous herbs was their screw-up.
Then what? Isn't that obvious?
I'll let you go first.
Well, whatever.
Shh!
You look like you're eating sand.
The time she turned the tables on me during training.
That's all it takes for today to become tomorrow
Your lover has been arrested for possession of illegal drugs.
However, I must make one correction.
He is not my lover, but simply a fellow traveler.
You should leave the country soon, too.
Can't do that.
Please use that to fund your travels or something.
Understood. I'll do that.
A silencer and a plastic knife.
What should we do with that man?
Guess it'll take a while longer.
So warm!
--Man, I knew you'd come,
It'll be impossible to leave the country right now.
Then about three days later, after they've worn themselves out hunting for us,
You're on the right track, but not quite there.
Talk about adding fools to the fire!
Master didn't kill those who ran, and she didn't shoot those coming to help.
Then I give up.

Plus, shooting them in the legs was more wicked than shooting them to death.

causing as much chaos as we may in the meantime."
--Sounds like we can take it easy until nightfall. --and has requested the citizens remain calm and patient.
If you're willing to go that far,
Ah, what an amazing tale.
But one day, two righteous travelers stood up on behalf of the people.
 see that many of the elderly in this country, especially the men, are using canes.
I'm all right now.
Where shall we go?
Yes. I arrived just yesterday.
Right off the vine.
The people in the office were kind enough to explain things.
All that matters is that you find a job and pay your taxes.
since it takes so much effort from everyone living in a country to keep it running normally.
How nice.
S-Somebody call the police! The police!
What are you doing?
Radio waves were transmitted to the machines,
which received them like radios and controlled the people.
You don't believe in these radio waves, right?
That'll be advantageous later.
So this idea that the country's citizens are being manipulated by radio waves
No, it can't be!
Don't lie to us!
These are all forgeries!
He's dangerous!
Give him back!
We will not allow anyone to get in our way.
Look! That girl's been influenced by the radio waves!
Chief, this is it for us.
Wh-What?!
Don't come near us.
I knew it!
How do you think the chief took those parting words, Shizu?
A car is coming!
He'd easily sniff out our ambush.
Right.
Of course, the one submitting the application receives some points, too.
they're judged as a terrible person.
On the other hand,
Indeed, I do.
Approached me with the intent of killing me?
Perhaps a child like this...
That chef is coming to our country, too!
Agreed!
We'll force the issue!
Do you know who this chef is?
We're interested in your cooking, traveler!
Once you make it, we can eat it!
Huh?
Yeah! The recipe calls for them in equal measure to the chicken!
How do you think the people of that country are faring?
Even Master nearly died from your cooking.
Yeah, I bet they were!
At first I was upset at the thought of having a knockoff of our own specialty, but...
Oh? What kind of dishes are they?
"May we find a country that accepts immigrants"?
What a good girl!
When we get inside, don't forget to clean me off.
You stayed your usual three days until this afternoon.
Huh? But wait...
"Kind Country"
So I was hoping to stay until the day after tomorrow.
Hello.
What does it mean?
I hate it.
Nothing.
Welcome to our inn.
Let me see.
I'm truly shocked.
Kino, you're a good cook!
I'd like to ask you something.
Yes?
She was a traveler who went around from country to country
Oh, Kino!
In the future, I'll inherit the inn from my mother and father,
That's mean. Who on earth would do such a mean thing?
Good afternoon, young lady.
Thank you.
They have to forge a pact with someone who'll ride them.
Well, I can't go as fast as a motorrad by myself.
So once this guy comes to, I'll need to ask him what he thinks about it.
You can talk to motorrads?
What is your profession, Kino?
You're an adult, right?
You mean going to various places?
The day after tomorrow, I'm getting my surgery.
You'll be fine adults, capable of doing all things properly, even things you hate.
Of course, I can't live off just that,
I often sing during my travels.
? Over rivers and beyond hills ?
? I'll give you some flowers ?
? So that you might be happy ?
Huh? I can't become a singer.
It's always been that way.
"Kino's Journey"
Father, Mother.
Yeah, you! You! You!
You're leaving already?
Why are you holding a kitchen knife?
You're a failure.
I don't need an apology. I want you to stand me up.
Hmm? Kino.
Nice name, right?
Yeah, I like it.
Encore! I want another two or three songs!
Stand me up.
Same thing we always do.
An evening rainbow in distant skies
"Anywhere will do"
"Fields of Sheep"
Ah, my back feels so warm.
What's that all about?
What is going on?
Wait, no! Stop!
Come on, come on, hurry!
I'll figure out some way to come back and get you!
If I get too hungry,
Then he climbed out of his car to try to escape, only to be attacked by sheep.
All right.
That's a lot to ask.
All's well that ends well!
Hey, stand me up now!
It's not like you were going to eat me.
--We're here. --We're here.
It was a very popular pastime for our country's citizens long ago.
I'm happy to hear they're doing well.
A motorrad isn't a tea table, you know.
Just go and turn into a hammock already.
I'm sleeping here.
And what about when you wake up?
Until I come with a good idea...
I'm going to sleep.
No, the shaking is light now,
Going to stick out your thumb?
Are you a traveler?
Um... So this really is a country, then?
While we're at it,
Sorry, Hermes.
It wasn't originally designed to carry motorrads.
There are two reasons we're constantly moving.
That's nice.
so you might be drinking it at lunch tomorrow.
I guess that's true.
Oh...
We'll find out in four or five days.
We can talk tomorrow.
A clean bed, white sheets...
Would you mind if we watched?
I see.
This is... Wow...
We would like to open discussions, so could your representative
we will have no choice but to defend ourselves and resolve this with force!
What bothersome people.
so we can pass through in less than half a day.
We won't allow that!
our sturdy wall will defend us!
We have a path now.
Then let us take it.
Should we attack with the laser?
I'll explain things to the children later.
What if we shot it with a persuader?
If you wouldn't mind,
causes some degree of bother to others just by existing.
Which one?
It's more like a floating island than a ship.
Okay, Riku?
That's perfect.
It's all right if you rough them up a bit.
making demands and calling them "petitions."
I can't believe it.
I'm glad to hear it.
Boy, I'm full!
How cute!
Hello, traveler.
You truly are kind, Shizu.
Traveler, stop right there.
We need to talk.
This country is governed by us,
Whatever happens to anyone is their own fate.
We won't reach the continent for a while.
And you're Riku, right?
There was once a ship named Tifana.
Yeah.
Then they could've just landed the country on shore.
Plus, as machines, the Tower Clan didn't think they could protect them from other countries.
That girl isn't part of the original ship country.
I'm sorry.
But...
I'm sure I'll visit wherever you settle down someday.
I'll happily welcome you when that time comes.
However, it wasn't happenstance!
Shush.
Is there something over there, too?
To dig holes when you have to take a dump.
Someone actually used one of those?
I see.
Our best mechanic performs maintenance on it,
Kino's planning to leave this country by tomorrow evening.
Hey, traveler.
You'll catch a cold if you go out dressed like that.
What's his deal?
But he suddenly came around asking, "Where did she go?"
Unable to bear it, a doctor told him,
But few have been able to last long with him.
and why we'll keep lying to him.
Kino, your turn.
I'll get dirty at some point anyway.
Later.
My siblings safely escaped to a neighboring country,
One day our spies reported news of a coming revolution,
I was very happy.
Do you think they'll pass my message on to her?
Not my friend's way of life as a spy for the royal family...
You...
Yeah. There might be things I don't know, too.
Yes.
Do your work.
and handed her over to us.
She was an orphan, apparently,
I believe my future is being tested right now.
This world is wonderful.
When that time comes,
Come on!
Those herbs are poiso
I didn't want to live life as a murderer,
Please. I beg you.
I'll show you.
How's that?
I'm not dead yet.
And not noticing the poisonous herbs was their screw-up.
Either way, their luck just ran out.
Ain't no one left to complain about it.
What?
Well, whatever.
Made an orphan,
But to her incredible fortune, they accepted her as an immigrant.
Why, indeed...
It was about a country with a tall clock tower.
What is it?
We're running low on food and fuel, so we'll need cash.
Let's use the rest to buy liquor and other things we can trade easily.
Make sure to sell high, right?
There are a lot of police officers.
So there you have it.
He's in the detention cells underground.
I'll leave him behind.
Yes.
What about the gems he had or the money he exchanged them for?
Man, I knew you'd come,
Oh?
so they leisurely loaded up a cart full of weapons and ammunition.
Sure.
the highest point in the country, and made their stand.
dropping it to the basement.
Ker-smash!
What? What do you mean?
She didn't do that, either.
Huh?
Master didn't kill those who ran, and she didn't shoot those coming to help.
Why not? What for?
they caused huge problems for the people who worked there every day,
causing as much chaos as we may in the meantime."
The various directors have demanded urgent response from the police.
Do you two have something you'd like to say?
Good morning.
So that's how it ended, apparently.
and safely left the country.
It's octagonal. This must be it.
Sorry to change the subject,
But what do you think would happen if Master visited here again?
But I plan to learn.
So be mindful of your behavior.
That's why most countries don't accept outsiders.
I'll... kill all of you.
We believe the remains found at the scene...
Incidents like this occur once every few years in this country.
which received them like radios and controlled the people.
Those unlucky enough to receive the transmissions
However, it is possible the outposts are still operating on generators.
Well, that, too.
Oh! And?
Why?
Now you all can rest easy
Stop it! Give him back!
No! Please, don't!
Wh-What?!
So we're leaving the country.
but the new outpost is operating perfectly.
I'll be spending the day with you instead.
I'm fine.
I think Ti thinks about a lot more than we assume she does.
When we departed, too.
Uh-huh. Let's go together.
Observe and report.
That's easy!
It's just a single girl, after all!
The people we should target are those
Just like yourself.
Have you already heard, traveler?
Yes!
so they measure it proportionately.
and accrued a great number of points does something wrong,
Figures.
Then you must have a whole lot of points built up, huh?
It's the first time anyone's ever accrued this many.
Yes, that's right.
I've managed to accrue all these points,
I've always wanted to!
Yes.
I'm impressed.
Yes.
All the restaurants in our country will prosper!
We're interested in your cooking, traveler!
Well, that's true.
Right.
However!
Another traveler has put a twist on the dish and left us the recipe!
"May I get a raise at work."
I'll go ask about immigration.
Because I'd rather act than wish.
What a lovely wish that is!
Immigration's out.
from Master's stories of her travels.
What?
When we get inside, don't forget to clean me off.
Easy, now. I'll explain.
I consented to the treatments and entered the country to stay for three days.
From the traveler Kino.
But rest assured. You were no different than usual.
As proof of that, take out the envelope in the right box.
I don't remember anything!
Who knows, huh?
Figures.
I guess I got a little too excited from riding so fast for such a long time.
Let's continue down that road a little more.
Nearly the entire population of our country lives here.
Yes!
I don't really understand, but...
I see...
Tomorrow afternoon, right?
I wonder if dwarfs live here as well?
This is just a backdrop.
They set this up so the people don't feel as if they're living in a confined space.
Yes, come in.
Hello there.
What kind of person?
Okay, this story won't leave the room.
Just you watch, I'll definitely go there!
So then you started writing to each other?
He's happily fulfilled his dreams and works hard.
When I take the medicine, I feel bad for a while.
The border is in the other direction.
Are you lost?
As I thought, I felt like I was being watched.
And then, Kino let me fall over.
Logue is actually in a place very close to Inertia.
So it will continue, in order to save the lives of many.
Then the package is for you.
I'd like to stay here for three days.
Kino!
And this is my wife.
They set this up so the people don't feel as if they're living in a confined space.
So, let's talk about our travels.
Hm? You want to go there?
But I've gotten used to it.
He's living with his family in a pioneer village now,
One year ago.
we decided to write one letter each month.
I'd like to give him this bird broach!
Yes.
But Logue definitely didn't die in vain.
Well then, it's about time I took my leave.
Let's have a long talk, then.
ikutsumo no yoru koete
After many nights

Concealing my tears that seem about to overflow
Welcome home, Kino.
Every time, I yell and yell, and you don't wake. It's your own fault.
As usual.
And here are the vegetables and bacon.
They told me they were anxious for your opinion.
Kino.
You're welcome.
A life doesn't have to achieve something to be considered meaningful.
Get ready.
So it didn't work after all.
Preparations okay.
Well, she's better than she was at first.
So to start, I'll teach you to raise me from a fallen position.
Given?
and you do not know if that is where the man you got your coat from came from.
Starting tomorrow, we will begin intense training. Do you understand?
Yes!
I wonder if Master was always this kind.
Must have been.
You should head to that house first and explain everything to the person living there.
When he was ten, he said, "For you, Mother", and gave me a handmade brooch.
But I'm truly happy you came.
Give me back my Kino.
Kino.
She'd have them drink paralyzing medicine and then with the knife...
that is, people who are outside the walls, are beyond judgment.
That is good.
I will teach you more.
an1I woke up before the birds.
an1Yesterday, I could not yet see it.
In order to do something
Every time, I yell and yell, and you don't wake. It's your own fault.
Good morning, Shishou.
To get things in order because the gunpowder seller is coming in the afternoon.
That's right.
But there are still things I need to teach her.
Simply being a good driver does not guarantee winning the race.
I worry about that in the long run.
And here are the vegetables and bacon.
Yes, thank you as always.
I've asked before, but are you sure you don't want to live inside the country?
In addition, I am no longer alone.
You're welcome.
Till next time.
Let's go.
So to start, I'll teach you to raise me from a fallen position.
or you have no right to ride a Moto-!
But...
Of course, that may not happen.
Please!
I understand what you have said.
I'll be praying for your good fortune.
I'm lending you this to protect you on your journey.
I wonder.
Even so, I get the feeling that "Shishou" has a strange ring to it.
Maybe it means something.
Perhaps it's a common name in foreign countries.
Whaaat?!
This must be it.
Umm...
Yes.
But I'm truly happy you came.
I'm home, Teacher.
You've cut your hair.
You're welcome.
I will.
Kino?
is what saves the traveler after struggling to the bitter end.
That's luck.
But it was accurate up until here.
So, do you keep traveling because you saw birds too?
Hearing that makes me feel very relieved.
If you can call it that.
Looks like I'll finally get to eat lunch.
Please answer a few short questions.
Please type how many are in your party
Thank you very much.
And very cheap!
The thing is, it's REALLY cheap
What?!
Cheapskate.
I'll think about it tomorrow.
Yeah, that one!
What if we just established ourselves here?
There are people here.
Plus, if we stayed longer, we wouldn't be able to go to as many countries.
Whoa...
That was a bit extreme.
You can't tell what I'm thinking?
That you should be considerate of other people's pain?
That's what everyone thought.
but I couldn't tell her how I felt.
but she was similarly disinterested.
You're being too cocky!
to be able to read other people's thoughts and be read yourself.
Do you think this is it?
When he gave me that last look, I felt like he was thinking,
So I answered with, "Thank you."
How long have you guys been here?
We've been here since the beginning of winter.
Kino-san, thank you so much.
by stealing the lives of other creatures.
if similar circumstances were to befall me.
It's not a bad thing, because a rabbit wouldn't help me out.
I don't think so, either.
It just means you're helpful to me in all sorts of ways.
So we can leave them, right?
She just couldn't stay away from the cool guy, you know.
And on the day all the men return home safely from the north,
Yeah, you could say that.
we trade human beings.
That might be true for Kino, but what are you going to do with me?
How kind of you.
I see.
I have them all over.
What are you, a knife dealer?
Because I was unable to help you guys.
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
Kino?
Come on, Kino.
I don't believe in it.
But some fortunes turn out to be right, though.
Yeah, that!
because for her, this is a journey to forget.
I see.
May I ask you a question,
Why didn't you?
May I ask you a question,
That's easy.
You're right.
He sympathized with my ideal against violence.
But if we had really encountered bad people,
Someone needs to preach the ideal!
I see.
At this rate,
I really appreciate such encounters.
Would you allow us to take shelter from the rain?
Please come this way.
Pardon me, sir.
I have brought a traveler, who came here seeking shelter from the rain.
I see.
I am a man with no material greed nor fondness of rank or fame.
The country where I was born,
If you kill someone, you will feel that you are stronger.
my brain developed antibodies against my self-consciousness.
If all people became like me, the country would fall to ruin.
Let me think.
There is no such thing.
There was no way he could have known how to restore me.
I am from the country where he was born.
they continued to conduct research in our country.
And at last,
And you're it?
What?
the endless expanse of Earth,
I think that's fine.
Do you?
I wanted to know why there are so many mummies lying around here.
It's too haphazard for a graveyard, I guess...
Please let us enter the country for sightseeing and rest.
Please go on through.
Do you have any Persuaders?
All the citizens also like to live peacefully and quietly.
These were used in the past
After all, we're having a war tomorrow.
There you go!
It's not like the wars of former times.
it was only a small settlement consisting of several dozen people.
Once a country becomes large,
That would be explained in the next corner,
or execution of the Tatatans.
Many people died during the war that kept on going tirelessly for years.
Utos, my eldest, was blown away along with enemy soldiers by friendly fire.
Yes.
Nothing would change, if I only insisted on stopping the war.
you will understand how I feel.
Of course, I feel sorry for the curator because her family was killed,
You will now come with us to our village
I understand how you feel,
but I do not want to die.
Where do you like best among all the countries you visited?
There, I was treated with kindness enough for many other travelers.
and the girl who has the name of a flower.
"Kids throw stones at travelers."
It makes me curious to know
Honestly, Kino, you're so into these things.
It may turn out to be a really memorable and unforgettable country.
Really? A traveler?
The whole country welcomes you.
Somewhere with a shower that isn't too pricey, if possible.
Ours is like that!
What's wrong, Kino?
Let me see...
So... Kino-san?
If you don't mind, would you let me guide you around this country?
I'll think about it.
Grandpa!
I'd like to ask you to repair a Persuader.
I'm closed today.
Thank you.
I used to always have it on my hip when I was traveling a long time ago.
and become a brilliant tour guide.
and they'll go home with many wonderful, unforgettable memories.
No matter when or where it is,
the stars shine upon the world in the same way.
Is that right?
There is...
What are you going to do now?
What shall we do?

The most important thing for a traveler
The map is right after all.
This map WAS correct a month ago.
Oh, I see.
A traveler's purpose in life is to travel.
Huh?
Please enjoy your stay!
It was good.
What?!
I'll think about it tomorrow.
What if we just established ourselves here?
Just as I thought, there's no one here.
Everyone is alone.
And even then,
The reason why I only stay for three days in any country.
Hey! Move, darn it!
You can't tell what I'm thinking?
The Land of Visible Pain?
and machines have done most of the work around here.
If everyone else is communicating their thoughts to one another,
I was very much into music,
We would deliberately think of unrelated things
to keep the other from reading our thoughts,
You really don't know how to do anything!
we had to distance ourselves enough so we couldn't read each other's minds.
you just couldn't live a normal life.
Since then, many years have passed with no children born in this country.
Oh, okay.
So the beautiful world...

No, there is no country around here.
I will be in the back room recharging my energy.
About that old lady...
Both of you work?
This area is heavily wooded,
It was good!
Yeah.
Oh, I haven't slept in a bed for so long.
I wonder, just where do they actually go?
I was not given that information.
What do you think?
Dinner...
I can't fix it.
Great!
Perhaps I need a little more grease.
No. I am all right.
When she was looking at the family, her eyes...
Please take me to them.
I am so glad...
The three of you, huh?
A few days later,
I don't know, either.

About what?
I don't think it means she has forgiven me yet for killing her fianc.
May I ask you a question,
since you are my senior when it comes to traveling?
Why didn't you?
Because I'm not a god.
Kino, which woman are you talking about?
Thank you for listening to my story, Kino.
You may have just been lucky.
He sympathized with my ideal against violence.
Even if it is many years after I die.
Why do you push yourself so much?
I don't feel I need to hate him anymore.
Because he tried to kill her, fearing that she would seek revenge.
You love her, don't you?
They were all killed without the chance to fire a single shot.
She may kill herself if she realizes the truth.
Are you the wise man?
The Great Wise Man is resting downstairs.
He is sick.
But I do remember I was in jail for committing some kind of crime.
What is the root of all desire that leads to crimes
If you kill someone, you will feel that you are stronger.
You have forgotten what I just said.
There is just one thing I am thankful for.
Before my grandfather died, he said,
"There is no such thing."
Are you all right?
Thank you for everything.
they succeeded in making humans with no self-consciousness and no desires,
Yes.
All I can say for now is that I no longer have a job.
Your journey isn't all that different from that Wise Man's.

It doesn't look like a country where they live peacefully.

I can show you the answer tomorrow.

I'll be your guide today.
Oh, it's going to start!
To me, it looked like nothing more than the massacre

We don't know about the hearts of the people living there, though.
Wait for me!

I'd like to ask you to repair a Persuader.
Let me think.
in this forest where there was no one who hated them.
I'm at the head of the stream.
of how the people of this country feel about this place.
Yes, I'd love to.
Yay! All right!
I'm so looking forward to it.
They get married awfully young.
Thank you very much.
I want to ask you a question.
Do you know someone like that, traveler?
It must have been out of concern for your safety.
It was fun today.
and they'll go home with many wonderful, unforgettable memories.
Really?
Congratulations!
The one thing I've always had is good luck.
Well,
Whoa! Kino?! What's gotten into you?!
Thank you.
See you again sometime.
It was a good country.
Ironically, no travelers came since we had changed our attitude.
When we started giving up because there were only three days left,
Furthermore, only the adults know this fact.
What shall we do?

I have some portable rations,

I will stay with you until you are able to get up and move again.
If I didn't help them out,

But maybe not?
Good grief, what's so great about that thing anyway?
I'm glad.
Hey, is it possible that you really do like that ring after all?
I thought for sure that she'd pick some spoiled, rich boy!
Are you married?
What's the Homecoming Festival?
several teams of men leave to do business.
and then at the end of winter we go back.
It's a really magnificent festival.
We're treated to free food and booze.
Of course, it almost didn't happen this year because of us.
we'll give you a warm welcome.
I'm ready.
Because we take a lot of pride in delivering our goods without a scratch.
So please don't give us any resistance, okay?
All right, now turn around with your hands up. Slowly.
Get rid of all of them!
What used to be their "goods".
Kino?

Why is the world coming to an end?
With the world ending soon, money is useless.
My heart trembled when I discovered this passage.
It was all a metaphor for the arrangement of the stars!
We have been preparing for this day for many generations.
Don't panic, let us now say our final prayers with sincerity.
So what do you plan on doing?
so no one can say for certain that it's impossible for the world to end
What's going on? We're all still alive!
No, there must be some mistake.
Everyone, please calm down!
You want to get going soon?
No, everyone always tells me that I can't dance at all.
Yes.
If one "tradition" is unsuccessful, they move on and set up a new one.
that country has denied all of their old traditions.
and watched over that country's traditions.
the words were broken down, in a past without tears...
He lived happily with his wife and child,
but it successfully communicated his deep sorrow.
Overwhelmed by the sorrow,
Surprisingly enough, the girl had perfectly memorized her father's words.
I do not know what number that girl up there is now.
It wasn't a very fun country to visit, was it?
When nineteen cold moons have crossed the sky
What's that?
Yes.
You came from that country, didn't you?
A book of prophecy was passed along to our country.
Take care, traveler!
Goodbye!
So the beautiful world...
But, you must have been a child at one time, right?
the sound of these insects' chirping echoes up to the sky.
If you are staying for three days,
You've come to the right country for that.
When nineteen cold moons have crossed the sky
Yes, it is said that it was published long ago in a land far away,
My heart trembled when I discovered this passage.
We have been preparing for this day for many generations.
Don't panic, let us now say our final prayers with sincerity.
Nobody knows how the world began,
Nothing even happened! What happened to the prophecy?!
They are really coming in handy.
Everyone, please calm down!
Yeah, I won't be shocked no matter what I see.
Whoa! You're a traveler?!
Then that's perfectly fine! Oh, yes, your permission to enter...
I'm announcing your arrival to the entire country.
Welcome, traveler!
Traveler, dance with us.
Goodbye.
Take care!
What kind of tradition should we do next time?
I am a scholar, who studies the traditions of that land.
Kino, you should have tried those cat ears on for them.
that country has denied all of their old traditions.
And we will continue to do so.
"The Sad Land"
Inside the closed in walls of the July that has come and gone,
It makes my heart ache.
What?
A sad country?
For him, words were things that flowed naturally from the depths of his heart,
and being someone unfamiliar with sorrow,
The exact meaning of the poet's words was unknown,
Only a bird with broken wings can sing the truth...
With light only silence...
that poem could be heard again.
The spent country made of glass...
How about it?
It seems like they are very grateful for it over there.
Oh, excuse me.
Our researchers deciphered the day it would all happen.
"When nineteen cold moons
When something I have faith in begins to fall apart
Hoshi no kagayaki ni mimi o sumashiteru
And find myself listening closely for the radiance of the stars
Aoi sora no tsuki no you ni
Or what?
Perhaps it was rude of me to ask.
Some place on the cheap side with a shower would be great.
Sure!
This way!
Huh?
Wait a little while longer and this guy will be moving around.
Somebody has to ride him and make a pact with him.
Of course!
Sorry for the wait.
Yeah.
If I had to say, I guess my job is traveling.
or things that you think are wrong.
This is a terrible thing.
I'm just Kino.
But, I turn twelve the day after tomorrow,
so after that, I'll be happy, even if I have to work at the inn.
Hermes, we're going to ride together and go on a journey.
Is there no other way that I can become an adult by just being myself?
She doesn't want to have the Great Operation done?!
You can't do whatever you want,
What's the meaning of this?!
I will guarantee your safety until you leave this country.
This is a land of adults, after all.
This man jumped out in front of me,
So you don't mind dying?
Then what's going to happen?
The pact...
Imagine that your body goes right down to the tires.
Don't turn with just the handlebars, lean your entire body to turn.
What are you doing?!
Stop!
Kino...
I am Kino!
You... Hermes!
That's not too bad.
even if my heart is full of sad words...
Touku de furidashita ame
It has begun to rain in a far off place
What's that?!
and the rail is all rusty...
Yeah, it's my job.
Exactly how long is that?
Yes, I suppose so.
It sure looks like it, doesn't it?
Oh, so you're a traveler.
There's something I would like to ask you.
Would that be all right with you?
We're working.
There's no way the machines would be wrong,
It's really tough on us. Some people get ulcers,
And the proceeds from those resources come to us automatically.
And that's why humans need stress?
Well...
Excuse me, may I ask you one last question?
headed to?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I'm not exactly sure.
Strange, isn't it?
But it's nice, because it really makes them easier to remove.
where are you-
Well, it's going on fifty years now, I suppose.
Well, my mother became ill and couldn't work,
tell me a story from your travels or something.
where are you-
and accomplished our revolution with almost no bloodshed!
Kino, we should be leaving soon.
What would you do if I called a vote right now
Touku de furidashita ame

Although, that only counts if it lives up to its reputation.

Hey, now, little boy, I wouldn't if I were you.
Please stop calling me "little boy".
Will this do?
This place is totally run down.
Are you serious, Kino?
Okay.
When did this all start?
The king is totally hedonistic.
But the husband got killed in the next game.
Starting tomorrow,
You're one of them, Kino.
I don't think so.
Ouch!
You saw it under the bridge.
Welcome home!
They're cute children.
That trick killed everyone else.
I was brought up to be no more than a killing machine.
Please stop calling me "Missy". It's embarrassing.
I'm Kino.
Miss Kino.

Put on my favorite play!
Oh, no!
But stupidly, his wife became afraid
I'm afraid I don't understand this art stuff.
Have I met you somewhere before?
Is that right?
as a special case.
You are exactly right.
from continually doing this sort of thing.
Then why do you continue?
taking everything with me!
Please excuse me.
What? No way!
It was my mother who taught me the basics of combat.
I needed to go beyond the mountain pass.
I won't shoot any more, so come on out.
Really.
Don't you need to follow your master too?
What do you want?
That's all.
At any rate,
But I've never heard of a final match between two people
Are you going to give us information on the opponent?
Me?
I wanted the excitement of life and death.
Father?
I'm not kidding! It's true!
So the beautiful world...
what kind of magic would you want?
Is it?
We've been stuck with each other since we were kids.
We kids took the liberty of calling him that
Help!
and made me live in the warehouse that she had purchased cheaply.
It was because I surprised everyone with the devices I made
just a wild fantasy?
Ouch!
...and so,
I'm not falling for that.
Come!
I slept well.
So, if a board is secured at an angle and you run at a high speed,

That's why you wanted to move the bronze statue.
Do you think humans can build machines that can fly?
but we have yet to see a machine that can fly.
If not,
I keep receiving complaints from your neighbors.
Please listen to me, Nimya.
but I imagine you already spent
In that case, I'll help you.
Right!
That's it!
No good!
to catapult it out in one shot like a Persuader bullet.
It flew?
I'm flying...
Nimya!
We should get going now.
Yeah, I know.
No reason.

I escaped from that country.
No, there isn't.
I just couldn't stand that place.
Yes, sort of...
and this is all you have?
Yes!

He might have been captured by the Castle.
No.
an underground organization that stands against the Castle.
I guess he found how fascinating books were then.
Won't you join us and fight together with us?
he suddenly retreated to his room
"I have written everything of the world."
And they say that book is still in the Castle.
He must be near.
Give it to her!
Damn!
they can no longer distinguish between reality and fantasy.
"Are you reading that ancient book again, Kino?"
"You can experience the world of the book as if it were real."
"Forget that the world was ruined,
It came to your hands.

Follow me.
I knew it, that book was identified as harmful.
Here is the isolation ward,
around the world into harmful ones and harmless ones.
It's the Author! Catch him!
Thank you!
This is it.
I'm the Minister of the Department of Reading and Welfare.
But he found a secret passage and escaped.
Oh my goodness!
How do you know that, Hermes?
Losing myself in the forest, I nestle up to the sky

So the beautiful world...

Encore!
Or what?
When I first met the traveler called Kino,
It was when I was 11 years old.
What are you doing?
When I asked them to sell it to me,
And don't adults have to always work at some kind of job?
Then that's not a real job.
We have to do them to live, right?
But everyone in this country does their job with a smile.
so I'm going to the hospital to have the operation.
Adults are people who have jobs, and that's a very hard thing.
But still, you must do them.
According to your definition of an adult, I don't think I am at all.
So what in the world are you, Kino?
I'm pretty bad, aren't I?
She's a failure! A horrible failure!
you do understand that every country has
You will be disposed of.
What should I do now?
If you stick around, you're going to die, right?
or rather, it'd be the same.
First, get on the seat in the back
Then what's going to happen?
Don't turn with just the handlebars, lean your entire body to turn.
When we tilt, you've got to keep your body down!
Who would do such a mean thing?
Oh, so it's been your voice.
I am...
I wonder if these are blossoming out of season?
Who would do such a mean thing?
I'd like work that I enjoy or gives me satisfaction.
Because of the caterpillars?
in the forest, it's easy to go in the wrong direction.
but I can't move this cart easily.
Did you remove the grass and polish this rail all by yourself?
Well, up we go.
There we go.
but it's probably been about that long,
so I was told to polish it the best I could.
This country was widely talked about, even among the travelers.
"A Land Where People Do Not Have To Work"
This country is beautiful, isn't it?
Excuse me. Hello.
Oh, so you're a traveler.
if only humans did all the work that the machines currently do?
Exactly. That's our job.
That's right.
You're awarded points depending on how hard the job is on you.
Isn't it an amazing idea?
they'll slack off and become lazy.
We need something in life
Do you like living in this country?
Excuse me, may I ask you one last question?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
And they have yet to tell me to stop.
I would never work!
You're welcome.
But it's nice, because it really makes them easier to remove.
Oh, traveler,
I've got all the materials I need right here, so...
so I had to support the family.
I apologize, but could you please go around?
"A Land of Decision By Majority"
It was necessary!
all he ever did was just play around.
when everything is determined by vote.
Nothing could be more dangerous!
How many executions have taken place so far?
And then, half a year ago my wife also died.
You're right, Hermes.
That'll be great!
I appreciate the offer, but no thanks.
to return fire on someone who has a persuader pointed at you?
Will do.
If we realize we've made a mistake,
Be happy, you're number 24.
It means you have a chance to finally become a first class citizen.
A first class citizen?
or serve as slaves.
How would I know?
But only when your opponent accepts your surrender.
Hey, now, little boy, I wouldn't if I were you.
I'm Kino.
This way!
The fights.
Oh, yeah.
Kino-san, it's your turn!
The wife surrendered and got out.
I said, "I won."
Congratulations to all of you who made it past the preliminary round.
Starting tomorrow,
the king will be here to watch the games.
Come on, don't be like that.
Welcome home! Welcome home!
Tell your mom that I think I'll be able to come home early today.
The current king.
now that there is no one left to rebuke the king.
It should be quite a shock even through the armor.
That trick killed everyone else.
No. I don't understand.
At least, that was the plan.
I refuse.
Kill him!
That's how it should end.
The four of you here are the ones who survived to the semi-finals.
Hm?
I felt no hesitation.
this morning's show is the great masterpiece of the century!
And in turn, the stage is the world!
The truth was,
the prince laughed from the bottom of his heart
You guys go too.
I told you to go!
Woman, will you not marry me?
from continually doing this sort of thing.
We will eventually meet our ruin.
and it always tempts me.
Yes, just as it did when I killed my father.
I am certain to follow the path of destruction,
I'm sorry.
Won't you please surrender?
What?
As you know,
When she was sick in bed, she told me that
When I came running back, she was dead.
and have everyone give their mothers white flowers on that day.
It really is hard to win without killing, isn't it, Master?
You've done well.
Liar.
Kill her!
I los-
because I got woken up early this morning.
I doubt a motorrad can show such consideration.
Don't you remember?
I met you at the east oasis some time ago.
but what made you change your mind?
I remembered her face at that time.
But I've never heard of a final match between two people
I'm afraid I can't do that.
I was just bored with life and with the world.
Father?
Is it?
I forgot.
Nimya?
You'll never get permission!
who brought cultivated fields and crops to this land,
because he was a weird old man
living alone away from the town.
went to study abroad when he was young
I imagine what the old man learned abroad
He had a sad end to his life.
Though I had failures more often than not.
that I had almost forgotten.
It's messy,
I'll tell you the reason why I wanted the bronze statue moved.
So, if a board is secured at an angle and you run at a high speed,
I rebuilt an engine I picked up at the edge of the country
I'm impressed that you came up with the idea.
That's why you wanted to move the bronze statue.
Yes,
How can I help you?
I can't believe it!
You, too?
I just want you to be an ordinary wife.
That way, we may not need to move the bronze statue!
That's it!
What's going on here, traveler?!
Nimya!
We need a long straight road to let it land safely!
Very much.
that the traveler came to this country.
I am truly grateful beyond what words can express.
I didn't think the machine would really fly.
Kino!
But it flies...
Yeah.
but this is all I have right now.
but is this it?
All the books brought here from around the world
But what if their decision is wrong?
Critics cannot make any wrong decisions.
That's about what I expected, though.
he read many books before they were screened
Since you're a top class persuader shooter,
I can't do that.
but we haven't received the manuscript yet.
and finished writing a book in two weeks.
as if there's something magical about them.
of becoming a character in the story.
What?
Some become so involved in the books,
those that have passed the screenings,
"Yes, father. I love this book," replied the girl.
"You can experience the world of the book as if it were real."
Oh, the traveler from yesterday.
You mean, they completely believed themselves
supposedly located in the Castle.
Just as I wrote in my book.
for the story in which you are the main character.
All people live in a fantasy
What nonsense!
There's only one way out of this hell.
The book written about everything of the world is there.
I knew it, that book was identified as harmful.
Don't any of you understand the charm in this?
Are they the critics?
I guess so.
Here is the isolation ward,
We will let you sort all the books collected from
The worst kind of people?!
I received this key from your fellow member yesterday.
Arranged?
We tried to take advantage of that
to show you our appreciation.
They're crazy people who ruin other people's pleasure.
Oh, my goodness!
She is too.
Let's go, Hermes.
Okay!
"Everything I think of can be written there."
I wonder if he's reached the next country by now?
Are you really sure I can keep this book?
Or?
That's not the problem here.
On top of that, the suspension feels funny and
the steering system and the wheel bearings are getting rickety.
I didn't expect to see anyone in a place like this.
What do you think? Isn't it nice?
I will ask them about you when they return.
This is the lab belonging to the person who created me.
This is the traveler, Kino-san, and the motorrad, Hermes-san.
Hi.
Welcome, traveler.
May I ask you another question?
Then, where do you go to work?
You're right, sweetheart.
What?
I'm so pleased!
Yeah.
After seeing the facility in the basement,
It was like watching the theater of the absurd.
Please watch the bottom of the valley very carefully.
A country.
I suppose many people must have lived there supporting one another.
The country we were looking for just might be...
I thought about that,
Alright! It's perfect!
So, it'll be postponed, huh?
Would you like me to take a look at the problem?
Thank you very much, Granny!
You're in no condition to be moved upstairs.
Yes.
Don't you want to know, Kino-san?
Who we are.
The country at the bottom of the valley
would be less pressured and that disputes would disappear.
She devoted herself to her research.
She spent many hours at the lab, day after day.
I see.
We rescued her and treated her in the basement laboratory.
For 54 years and 341 days since then,
Are you leaving?
Yes.
If you leave,
I can be your child. I can be your lover.
We're of no use.
I see...
Hm?
The Japanese government
Where's Mom?
and the Council is in a heated debate.
Gotcha!
That was so fake.
Huh?
Huh?
Ow!
What?
You take being half-asleep to a new level.
It doesn't hurt or anything.
Sorry.
But if this has anything to do with that weird creature I saw last night...
F-Fail?
What about my right hand?
Sleep.
Is something wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
talking right hand weird
Nakamura-san, your laundry...
Even if I went to the cops, they'd just think I'm crazy.
It's morning...
Did you really come from outer space?
You probably would have become
A mother and her daughter were killed.
But, you and bugs...
Please stop talking.
Me... with my animal host.
It intends to fight.
What?!
Fight?!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Look.
It was living off the dog's organs and digestive system, as I'd suspected.
It's like I'm talking with an insect
that doesn't have a shred of empathy.
Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.
"Life must be protected."
Seriously?
What's wrong with a little fun?
Whoa!
I suppose I should change my face, just to be safe.
for those creepy parasitic creatures.
But I can't just keep calling you "you" or "him"...
Hey, Yuko!
U-Um...
What the hell was that about?!
C'mon, gimme a break...
There are pretty graphic videos being upped to the net, too.
but a fanatical cult or something.
Listen!
I have never considered the life of any other being valuable.
I would do everything in my power to prevent them.
I don't even want to hear that kind of logic.
I'm going to fight for humanity!
Stop right there!
like the arm to the more complex head is not possible.
But you won't have a choice once I cut off that human's head.
Hold on!
I value only my own life.
M...y...
like the Mincemeat Murders.
You like animals, right?
Corny!
Gosh, I drank way too much!
No way.
but even if you feel that I'm close, you should stay away.
Why do you think that?
Shinichi.
But the way you talk to her gives her all kinds of hints.
Come at me.
I just heard gunshots, too.
Seriously?
Huh? He's gone.
Yeah...
The Metropolitan Police just held an emergency press conference.
No problem.
But by the time morning comes, I've forgotten most of it.
that I remember them pretty clearly.
so you shouldn't have anything to be afraid of after that.
That's unusual.
You're talking like an old man, Izumi-kun.
Come on, let's go.
Uh, I had a hard time breathing, all of a sudden...
I really care about her.
See you later.
without any doubt...
Two below, too.
But in this crowd...
Our eyes met,
A parasite, running for mayor?
Revolutionary
That dream again...
The first possibility is, by assuming a human identity
If that is the case,
But it wasn't just you.
What are you thinking about?
I just want to know how many of them have gathered here.
Aren't you curious to know how others of your kind have evolved?
Well?
Mitsuo!
I need to talk to Kana.
But we will never develop what humans call "sympathy."
I'm assuming you wouldn't want to observe your own
It wasn't him.
I told her everything I knew about parasites.
Show me how your right hand can change shape.
That's not it.
If you don't like me, just tell me already.
That solves the problem, doesn't it?
Hey, since I told you my secret,
She said she can tell me apart from the rest,
but does she really have that kind of power?
C'mon, look.
Give me a break!
Sorry.
That female, Kana... Her power has grown stronger.
So, because of that...
It'll be fine!
I can just bluff.
she'll just be dismissed as a high school girl talking nonsense.
How about tomorrow?
But we have a problem.
Whatever you do, don't go near the train station.
Incoming Call Izumi Shinichi
and she may not be sending one out right now.
I'll see him soon!
No, I detect a signal from my own kind.
Wait, if Kana detects that signal...
Kana...
before, too...
He's the one who found the victim.
No wonder he was upset.
But who killed that parasite?
No human could do that.
Are you...
Could it be that...
Hey, Izumi-kun.
Yeah...
Yeah.
Yes.
He sounds like he could be a threat.
I've changed your diaper.
There, there.
Oh, it's Mommy.
I have it trained well, don't I?
Thank you for the help.
Please come again tomorrow.
Yes, that's right.
A woman?
Things going well with your girlfriend?
but you've heard about Izumi-kun, right?
and he knew the girl who was killed.
Sorry, I have to go take care of something.
Was his right hand moving in a peculiar way, for example?
I'm the one who's strange for being so calm about it.
I won't.
go back to the crime scene?
and what he's doing now,
This might be a strange way to put it,
Do you comprehend the position you're in now?!
Migi, stop it!
What's one more death?
There is no reason to hesitate!
I'm tired.
He got away.
It means that, although he knows a lot about us,
Izumi Shinichi is a parasite!
Izumi!
Izumi!
Read the next page.
They'll come.
Please, hear me out!
It's about Kana-san.
You canceled our date that day
That's not...
But sometimes, I can barely stand to watch you.
Don't try so hard to go it alone.
How can I believe that nothing's going on?!
It was just as well.
he'd start treating Murano like a monster, too.
Yeah, the man we ran into before...
Why didn't you say so sooner?
We might as well track down everyone involved in their investigation, and
No.
But you've already helped me before.
I remember it well.
About his name: we decided "Parasite" was too confusing
Yeah.
You look exhausted.
I did go to a doctor, see?!
Please calm down.
I may not look it, but I've calmed down quite a bit.
I see it now!
W-Wait!
But first, we'd like you to hear our side of the story.
He's modified his face so that you won't learn what he looks like.
First, please listen carefully to what I tell you.
At first, the P.I. was taken aback,
I'd never believe it under normal circumstances,
but given that there's a monster right in front of me,
So you're sticking with the whole "a P.I. never reveals his clients" thing, huh?
So cute.
is the "selfish gene."
the body of an animal is merely its DNA's puppet.
What matters is not its species, but itself,
in fact, merely behavior to better the transmission of an individual's DNA.
and even others who are of an entirely different species.
Who holds their baby like that?
Coexist, huh?
From a pig's perspective, humans are merely monsters who feed upon them.
I have reasons why I absolutely can't forgive your kind!
I'll kill you!
I think I will lose if I fight you now.
Come, let me take a look.
Fortune Telling
It's fast.
Yeah, that's great.
They're so fast!
This is nothing new, though.
I knew,
this must be one of the dining areas coordinated by Hirokawa's group.
That means our actions constitute
Anyway, we need to get clear of this place as soon as possible.
He even suspected me of being one of the monsters.
Do you want your father to be killed, too?
What?!
From this day on,
I have a wife and child.
I won't ask for help from any other human.
but I just want to save as many people as I can!
Why are our opinions so incompatible?
I suppose it's unavoidable.
However, I would like his body to be brought back intact.
Why?
This is my chance!
Don't be so eager.
You should just stay on the move...
I guess I can take a small breather.
A taxi?
I guess they gave up.
Maybe I was wrong...
I'm glad you're okay.
There are three of them in his body!
Teito Private Investigation Agency
I'll take care of him.
Parasyte
It's hard to comprehend that
Why not produce more of your own?
What?
Man, you really like to run.
Let's aim for the legs, as you suggested.
No way!
I don't sense independent thought in his arms' movements.
Rather than aiming for the legs or torso, go for the head.
What's wrong?
In an instant, he assumed control over his entire body
and became a single lifeform.
F-Five?!
and only I can unify everyone.
It appears we have traveled quite a ways while I was asleep.
No way!
It's not my fault.
Chief.

Furthermore, Kuramori-san's office,
Kuramori Family Massacre Possible Revenge Homicide
It's our sixteenth time meeting in your dreams,
Lose?
He was acting like something really bad was going on yesterday, too.
You are a mystery.
Why were we born?
Yes, the strongest signal we are capable of emanating is our intent to kill...
However, it makes me happy to realize that parasites, myself included,
My body's muscle strength exceeds yours.
Yeah.
My lower body!
It's not... me!
Is it Hikawa?
Please stop!
Shit!
How dare you?
you should strike them down in a single blow without making a show of it.
The strongest signals we emit are animosity
is friend or foe.
That's right.
It's unlocked.
Huh? He left?
Dad?!
because you're someone who's halfway between human and parasite.
Where is Ryoko?!
He's not here.
I mean...
I can tell something's going on, at least.
I see you're worried about him.
Sorry! Go on without me!
That's good to hear.
could kill a... human baby...
Tamura Reiko is on the move.
Are they here?!
We won't let her get away!
Kuramori-san?!
Kuramori-san!
What's your name?!
I've killed 38 so far.
About Gotou, the man who recently pursued you...
Don't come any closer!
You are Tamur a Reiko-san, correct?
Why are you here?
Who am I, Ikeda-kun?
even this should be able to find its mark.
but I'm afraid I have no choice.
I'll take full responsibility!
No way...
She's coming toward us!
Wait, Shinichi.
Stop fire!
For what purpose was I born into this world?
another would arise in its place.
If I'm to stop my journey, that is fine, too.
In the end, I didn't do anything to it.
"Thank you"?
It felt... rather pleasant...
She's dead?
Welcome back.
I don't think there's any point in seeing them.
Humans...
Detective, I'm actually innocent.
Please believe me!
I should calm myself down, one more time...
I'm going to have you meet five people.
He is responding slightly to my telepathy.
What's wrong, Uragami?!
How could you put such a hottie in front of me?
Is he actually...
His focus may drop.
Th-There's no mistake!
Izumi-kun, thank you for waiting.
What I think?
But mentioning Kuramori to you has no effect.
But... Migi...
it wasn't all that different from the kinds of things I did.
If you're referring to one Tamura Reiko was holding in her arms,
Why?
No.
You go ahead.
saved me.
Conference Room
and Yamagishi-kun will oversee the core operation
Eyes, I see...
Oh, wait.
I'll return them once I make copies.
Yeah.
Listen up!
Izumi!
Wow.
Yeah.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'd like your help.
Everyone here is trying their best to forget what happened!
like normal high school students.
I hear you saw Hirama-san and his men put down one of them recently.
but I'd like to hear your opinion
But I think it'll be effective.
and just "us" on the surface.
Huh.
It can't be.
They're claiming they're the police?
Not through the screen like this.
Am I even going to be needed?
Migi, you can't tell how many there are?
Switch the route.
What was that sound?
Hey, what's going on, huh?
Just in case, we'll wait a few minutes to assess the situation
What's going on?
Hey, c'mon.
So it's this vehicle.
They're all on top of each other.
What's the matter?
Huh?
Quiet, everyone!
Shit!
Forget it, let them go!
Huh?
you'll accompany the joint team formed by the Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads.
Stupid.
Humans had the upper hand from the start.
What's the holdup? C'mon!
Seems to be pretty effective.
In situations like this,
Understood.
C'mon.
Hey, you, behind me and to my right.
Looks like they've chosen the winner of the Kayama Fantasy Literature Award.
Not again...
It doesn't even surprise me anymore.
Again?
Approximately 30 meters away.
It's nice to meet you all.
She's looking at me.
Listen up.
After doing five laps around the field,
Well, let's just monitor the situation for now.
Oh, um, well...
I'm jealous!
Guidance Office
All right.
Why are humans so irrational?
That's why I want more data.
Uh, do you have any plans today?
We don't know that yet.
Did you try asking that to your right hand?
That's all there is.
Hey, are you all right?!
An intruder?
and evacuate to the school grounds
She is approximately 150 meters away.
Evacuate using the stairs near Wing C
Don't push. Stay in line and keep moving.
I have a plan.
No way!
What we want?
A "wall of meat"...
Don't come near me!
Oh, um...
What's the matter, Shinichi?
That is how animals live.
Your Japanese is really good.
You understand human speech so well,
It's not that I want to die.
What separates us?
He's one.
That's right.
Next time:
that human numbers must be reduced immediately.
That the crime of pollution
is far greater than the crime of manslaughter.
fit perfectly into the beautiful hierarchy of nature!
Hirokawa...
Prioritize the prosperity of all life over that of the human race!
Or should I say...
What's the matter?
For a human.
U-Uragami...
Oh, wow, it blew his hand right off.
It's of no concern to me now,
How do you even work?
I predict the direction of fire based on the opponent's eye and hand movements.
I'm just a wild organism.
There is too much interference,
I don't know!
I have no idea!
It's just a feeling.
We can't give up that easily.
No.
We'll pit military forces against him again.
How?!
Apologize.
I apologized, okay?!
Yeah.
Izumi-kun...
And I'm so close to graduating.
Huh?
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Let's talk.
I've called Migi cold-blooded a lot,
In the end, I'm trampling over those around me in order to live.
Let's run.
Listen.
It's unlikely that his entire body is armored,
require a tremendous amount of energy.
But the angle of attack is still poor.
There!
Well done.
Thanks to that, we made many good memories as friends...
I should go.
You lost your right arm a long time ago, from the looks of it.
Besides, you look like you've been crying.
Shin-chan, then.
have been keeping watch day and night,
Uh, who're you?
I think he looked like you...
His... name?
I don't know how I can ever repay you.
What?!
And its legs!
It has to be!
But see this blood? It's all Kitayama's!
I can't just abandon them.
But you...
Dear...
or even in the whole world.
to require less human flesh and thus become more human.
What? What are you talking about?
Not only did I obtain a massive amount of information at once,
So, I will stop all surface activity for the time being.
What do you mean, "Huh?"
Well, I should get going.
I'm going to flip the switch.
But that's okay.
Really?
but in a broader sense, they were our kindred.
Wait here.
Be honest, like me.
What are you getting at?
Both Izumi-kun and I have gone through it.
You're the monster, jerk!
I think this girl's going to be more fun.
I'll get to her in time!
Toys are so easily broken...
I know.
Three, he says.
We were all born here on Earth...
we will lose.
That'll make my defense practically impenetrable.
That is our advantage.
What we can do that A cannot
What is this pipe?
The weak, cowardly human attacked?
Pushing the pipe through his back gets rid of the "spout."
It makes no sense.
As time passed and life settled down again,
I don't want to attract attention over something like this.
Th-Then...
What are you talking about?
When I took over this human's brain,
Calm down, Shinichi!
Die.
I got a call from your school, so I rushed over!
She must be Tamiya Ryoko's mother.
It can't be...
What's the matter?!
that I can separate from you.
Now that I've matured without eating a brain,
A trip?
but I'm making tempura right now,
H-Hang on, Shinichi.
Are you all right, Shinichi?!
Nobuko, your hand...
Then I guess I shouldn't have been so against it.
Oh, okay.
What's going on with you?
But when I talked to my friends about it, they laughed at me.
Have we?
Not really...
Then let's go a little farther.
Don't tell me this is your first time in a car.
This body will die.
Male or female, controlling his body shouldn't be that different.
Move.
because your body wanted more sleep.
Sleep is beneficial.
That may be the reason.
Interesting...
That's your reason?
You awake now, Four-Eyes?
Are you being serious?
I might regret this now.
You're...
Huh? No real reason...
Ow.
Stop acting like a hero!
Stop it!
Stop!
There are times humans can't back down from a fight!
Why won't he run?
Let her go.
Shut your damn mouth!
It's rejecting me?
I can't even use a body of the opposite sex now.
It's okay.
You're the only one I know who'd go that far,
I'm beat.
Yeah, this was worth rushing over in a taxi.
I'd like to bring Shinichi here someday.
It's not like you can tell how it tastes.
Dad!
Shinichi, what's wrong?
That monster...
What is going on here?
What? My right hand?
You remember, right?
Shinichi-kun!
i1That's why she looked up our address and came all the way here.
Excuse me.
Has my wife's body been found?
but that she'd be staying one more night.
I know it wasn't!
Bye!
By a monster!
i1What?
i1Does he really think he dreamed it all up?
i1Wait.
i1Maybe this is my chance to reveal him.
What?
Excuse me.
i1I'll eventually have to tell him everything I know.
It's not the same.
My physiology was slightly altered as a result.
Yeah.
I lost my cell phone and my tablet when I fell into the sea.
I guess.
I see.
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?
Shinichi!
Hey!
I told you to wait,
Shinichi,
kf
He still has his human brain.
What?!
Huh, now this is pretty unusual.
She didn't say why,
but I think she got sick of my easygoing, indecisive personality...
Forget taking his brain...
I see.
Shut up!
I wasn't sure what kind of monster I'd see.
It must be so hard on you.
and he's always crying over them.
He really does cry a lot...
But I'm also glad.
You didn't realize it?
This requires practice, you know.
That's right.
only accounts for about 70 percent of my original self.
When I closed the hole in your heart,
so my fragments scattered throughout your body.
Migi.
I may just be imagining it.
It was the same earlier today, too.
Uda-san cried like a baby when he met
The hole in my heart, huh?
Jeez, what's your deal?
It's here! A parasite!
We don't stand a chance against her.
At least...
It'll be fine.
Isn't this bad?
You're the second one I've met whose brain is intact.
Huh!
You are pathetic.
Die now.
as if the parasite is asleep.
A monster should look like one!
No, humans don't have that kind of agility...
But...
Shinichi?
"Freezing Point."
and observe without killing him.
Is there any point to that?
our future as a species.
Let me through. I'm going home.
Did you bang Kana?
Huh?
Anyway, there's your answer.
I ate something.
Never mind.
Something that's an important part of being human.
Its internal organs are mush. They're irreparable.
Izumi-kun...
It's dead.
Poor? But it's dead.
But...
But that's not...
Murano...
What?
What did I say wrong?
Not from my perspective, anyway.
If I'd done this in the first place,
No, this one seems like a different individual.
It can't be Uda-san and Parasite, right?
It's coming.
I recently settled on that as my name.
I thought I should start off
I wish I was in the same class as Hide.
What? Like you don't.
Huh? Why now?
What's going on?
I was really shocked when you did that,
I shouldn't have said that he's cold and unfeeling now.
What should I do?
No, how I can trust them?
Forget...
H-Hi...
About the other day, um...
Why'd you have to scare Murano?
You! What do you think you're doing?
Like I said many times, I have no intention of fighting you.
I don't know why I got it wrong just now, though.
I would rather avoid causing trouble,
Oh, sorry. I mistook you for someone else.
His right hand's signal is weak again.
Hide's a real hottie, huh?
Nah, no way.
When people stop trusting each other,
There is nothing to be gained by going public now.
who's given it so much thought.
Or is he watching someone?
About the other day, that was...
most likely all human.
Izumi-kun?!
It's over that wall.
That can't be...
You've finally shown what you really are!
Isn't that right?
You're gonna run?
Friend?
I'm talking to you.
Murano...
Thanks.
I didn't do any of that!
Did something happen between you and Shimada-kun?
Izumi-kun...
It's not normal.
but I'm not trying hard at it.
Why are you different, then?
If necessary,
What is it, Yuko?
If...
Did you just wake up?
Hey, look.
Aw, no way.
Wait, "attack"?
I can't contact my cells due to interference from the dead cells.
What's that you're wearing on top of your head?
Shinichi, control your breathing!
I'm breaking.
I can't...
and three relatively close by.
It'll be okay.
N-No way!
Come back!
There's something I have to do.
yet we did nothing and left him alone.
and made it public knowledge
Huh?
That's why we'll chase them down, and...
so killing my kind has no psychological effect on me.
Until now, we have been keeping their existence a secret to avoid panic.
However, perhaps it is now time to make it public knowledge.
By public,
Although they are sentient muscle,
they possess intelligence on par with that of humans.
If they cannot secure blood circulation,
they may writhe out of survival instinct,
When you pull out human hair, nothing happens.
Well done, Professor.
The idea is to isolate a hair-sized mass from the main body.
If that's the case...
Now, I do apologize for the intrusion,
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your messages.
It's okay.
I see.
Thank you.
Persia!
-You damn Western nobles... -Barbarians of Touwa...
and the Principality of West study side by side.
and the West's student dorm, White Cats House,
I was watching you with my hidden feelings from afar
I decided to become strong enough to change the world
That's all I could hope to do.
Inuzuka, I swear I'll take you down!
I'm sick of these games!
But if I fail I couldn't show my face on the grounds again!
Should I do some recon?
I-- I give.
No, I've still got a long way to go.
Is a strength enough to even change the world.
Whenever I talk about this,
That's why I can't afford to be underestimated by anyone.
Some Black Doggy kid made fun of us and called us weak!
Big sis will take you on any time.
First, I'll reach out to her in secret.
Well, I was...
According to our research, she returns to her dorm alone after practice.
Die!
You've been talking so big, despite being a girl.
That's low...
If you were attacking me...
But if you were saving me, then why?
I'm your enemy, am I not?
Teacher!
influence not to be disobeyed by anyone,
in order to change the rules of this world.
Very well. I won't hold back.
help you out with it.
but you have to show me that you can change the world.
If I can be with you, that's fine.
And so, the two of us...
Oh, hey, Persia.
What a coincidence.
Persia is once again shining like the sun's rays, guiding us--
That's right, because people are around.
This is my first invitation from Persia! I'll make sure it's a success!
He's also Inuzuka's older brother.
Just you and me
I'll show you how true love will feel
I expressed all of my feelings to you
So I could protect you
I'd been going on about how I wanted something shiny, so he bought whatever he could find.
That's not all.
Believe you?
It doesn't involve you, Teria.
This unworthy soul has felt bliss
Whenever Airu administers punishment,
-Awesome! -Thank you very much!
A second son of the Inuzuka family spends five minutes or less on the toilet.
-I'll just wait for tomorr-- -Tomorrow has finally come!
The success of tomorrow's birthday party depends on us!
Get up.
Looks like his spirit's been completely broken.
I'm going to wash my face.
It might look like just a regular birthday to you.
I have to meet with Persia, celebrate, and then return within an hour.
Come back.
You're too loud!
Romio is trying to climb a wall of his own.
I don't know what you're up to, but you'd better make it quick.
I finally get to see Persia. I can wish her happy birthday.
Why are you here? We were supposed to meet
Next time, "Romio and Juliet and the Birthday."
Those Black Doggy barbarians are no match!
Hey!
Inuzuka? What's he doing there?
Boarding School Juliet
My brother is in class.
We won't be able to see each other.
He needs to see the nurse!
I'll live out the rest of my days here in this infirmary.
Oh, try using some feed.
Hasuki!
Get a hold of yourself!
You look so distressed.
I thought I was prepared for this treacherous path.
I want to be with him forever.
It was fun!
I can see right through you.
Hey you...
Get back here! Apologize for slapping my breasts!
Inuzuka?
Right!
But should you be doing this?
One hundred a piece!
This time I'll wish her happy birthday. Then she'll have to...
-Our time is up whenever Airu decides to show up! -Let's go!
How dare you ruin Per's birthday bash.
The White Cats House isn't so weak that it could be besieged so easily.
I won't ever let go again.
Yeah!
This guy smells like serious trouble.
I'm Cait Sith, a second-year.
Did that kill your buzz?
I really like things that are fun, you see.
Persia is above us.
What's this about?
I was called in as support today.
I wanted to watch you for a bit longer, but...
Even if it's forbidden love, we're serious.
-That's why I... -I...
Well, suit yourself.
I'll admit it.
Now I can't kick you at all!
It was faint,
Insane? Who's the insane one, you idiot?
I-I never got to tell you.
Even though I told you I didn't want you to get hurt over me.
I was so, so happy.
I'm sorry for worrying you.
Today's incident made me understand.
I'm going to search for Romio.
Guess we're all in for a punishment.
Hasuki, save us!
He's so hot and cold!
N-Now that's what I call cute.
Let's go, Persia!
Lady Persia!
So, you found a solution.
Everyone's doubts are starting to surface!
After overcoming all those obstacles...
It's more humiliating than you could've hoped. I'm sure you feel the same.
Draw your sword.
A duel with this? This is a real sword!
If we make even one mistake...
Call the housemaster! Hurry!
I love you.
Come, Romio.
You should've backed down while I was going easy on you.
Inuzuka!
Scott, we're leaving.
C-Can you wait for me until then?
I'll wait as long as I have to.
we've confined them to their dorms for a week.
I thought it was strange.
It's so irritating that Persia had to be punished too!
Why?
Romio.
Brother! I want to aim for prefecthood!
I knew you've been looking at me with those naughty eyes.
Don't give up!
Barbarians of Touwa...
and the Principality of West study side by side.
Isn't that...?
Wait for me, Persia.
I will protect you with my life.
I'm sick of these games!
The strength I'm aiming for...
I truly feel that way.
-Let go of me! -Those guys!
-What did you say? -Simply lashing out does not amount to a retaliation.
That's strength.
Going to co--
Inuzuka?
-Here's a mask. -Thanks.
You let your guard down.
Not yours, the girl's!
What? All's fair in a nation's proxy war.
No matter the method...
Another word and I'll devour you!
If I had the courage to enter the dorm she's in and clear up this misunderstanding...
No. It may be hopeless at this point.
Is this... a love letter?
No...
or were you saving me?
Then I'll settle the score with this sword.
I'm your enemy, am I not?
The strength I'm aiming for...
She wants the strength not to lose against men,
and hit you...
I'll only say this once. Our relationship has to be an absolute secret.
Now that we've met, we might as well walk to school together.
That's right, because people are around.
It's just...
I wanted to know more about you.
That's not what I meant!
I guess I just wanted to be alone with you.
How cold...
Inuzuka!
Persia...
I can't believe you! You pervert! You peeping tom!
Wait, wait! I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I've done a lot of research,
What do Westerners do as lovers?
Hasuki would gladly nurse you back to health every day.
Hey, why are you running? Stop!
What is it this time?
Is that kind of thing just impossible at a school like this?
Hey!
It's dark, so we're fine.
Next time I go to town I'll buy a better one.
Hey!
In the West, you use a rosary for daily prayer,
Why don't you take this time to cool your head.
I can't swim!
Help! Lady Persia!
Let's go to Dahlia Park!
Listen to me.
All right. Now I can put the date plan I made for today to use!
He's a relative of mine. He's in middle school.
Then you'll have to defeat me.
Sounds good to me!
Damn it. How did we end up in this boring run of the mill shop?
Whoa, look how Julio's holding the chopsticks!
Julio, let's go to the haunted house!
Come on, hurry up.
Can't you see we're busy?
Zombie!
If you're looking for Julio, he just ran--
Where did she...?
I wouldn't be caught dead.
Inuzuka!
Could you move that foot of yours?
I hope we can get along as well.
As if!
That's completely different from when you're with me.
-Inuzuka! -Battle continues!
but our date was surprisingly fun.
I'm glad I've got to know him better.
-Why? -That day...
Let Hasuki lend a hand.
Stop the car, Sebas.
But we haven't arrived at the school yet.
Hurry, we're going to meet her!
My glasses in space--
-Your whole existence is boring, so I hit you anyway. -That's horrible!
Think we care? We're not on your retainer.
-Inuzuka! -What's come over you?
I'm the leader of the Black Doggies! I'd rather die than be--
Persia is looking at me like I'm a dust rag that hasn't been washed in a week.
He's the worst. That's the enemy's princess.
No matter how big her boobs are.
It's not over yet.
I guess I'll go expose that picture--
I'm begging you. Right now, I know Touwa and the West don't get along.
If you're found out, you'd lose your campus team and popularity for sure.
A picture, then?
Go catch one! There are some in the forest nearby.
Feed me.
I'll cut off your bangs and transplant them to your armpits!
But this girl...
Come now, hurry it up.
If there's anything else you don't understand,
DAY BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY
Sorry, got to go.
It's only natural she'd be angry about it.
I'll have to pull out all the stops.
You've got some guts.
She's precious to me.
I don't want Persia to find out about these feelings.
Buy some time.
I can't get in!
No, it's nothing.
I just kind of felt like you wouldn't be coming back.
No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side.
-If you're found out, I won't be able to blackmail you. -Right.
That's why I'll never approve of this.
That rosary, how...?
-Hey, Inuzuka, I can't find my prized Persia photo. -Can't help you.
I don't need any friends.
Three days before our tests.
You called me here because you couldn't see me for three days?
Am I not allowed to study?
Rich coming from the guy who's borderline failing every year.
-Who's that? -It's Hasuki.
-What was that for? -I said no speaking without permission.
His academics are on par with high schoolers,
All right, now I can show off to Persia. Question one.
-Wake up! -What is that?
But, I'm still getting sleepy--
Just avoid getting caught.
are boobs!
Yeah.
-Well, good luck on your tests. -What was that just now?
If you ever need anything, just ask.
Hasuki isn't someone who'd start rumors.
Did you really think we were clueless?
When I was a kid, I wasn't good at talking with people and being around them.
I couldn't make any friends, so I just studied all the time.
Those words from Inuzuka were my turning point.
I'll tell you everything, so hear me out.
No.
What are you planning to do with the Touwa sword?
You can't be serious.
You're keeping me up.
You're not getting away.
Nothing.
Where'd that Inuzuka go?
Persia?
Let's face them, no running away.
I know you can change anything.
from the bottom of my heart.
Persia!
Good morning.
White Cats will taste defeat! Touwa guys will not be beat!
I'm starting to want it.
Bento?
Shut up! One more word and I'll rip your jaw bone out!
Inuzuka, say "Ah"!
Looks like they've been burnt to a crisp.
I no longer have the luxury of choice.
I thought so!
Do you intend to violate the bento Lady Persia made?
Lady Persia saved me when I'd strayed from the path.
our lunch is over!
I can't breathe!
All of Persia's hard work...
-Forgive me! -I'm sorry!
If you don't want them, I'd intended to eat them myself.
-They're really into it. -Pick it up! You want to lose to the White Cats?
We've been running since morning.
No, Inuzuka already...
Let's both do our best!
Everyone's excited about the dumb sports festival.
Oh, that's right, knave.
You ass!
Who are you? Where did you barge in from?
Talk all you want. It's not like I'm entering.
-Dignitaries from Touwa and the West are coming? -Yeah.
So close! Persia's sweet scent...
Sorry. The stimulation-- I mean--
Well, I see you've gotten serious about it.
It's because of last year's sports festival, right?
False start, false start! He's drowning us out!
The three-day Dahlia Academy High School sports festival has finally begun!
What was that?
Let's go, everyone!
I confess all my love for you, I swear
as you shined bright
I guess I just wanted to be alone with you.
-Lo-- -Found you, Inuzuka!
No thanks! I can handle this on my own.
Persia...
Father!
It might just be self-satisfaction,
but I want you to accept this as proof of our love.
I could ask you the same thing.
I'm sure you intend to attack Persia while her guard is down! You bastard!
The dorm? How did I get here?
But it's okay!
but we have to protect the Black Doggies' good name!
Inuzuka?
It's all over!
But--
Hey!
Of course.
No way.
Help me! Persia!
Who is this little cutie?
With this we can go on a real date.
Art thou a fool?
I could have sworn I smelled Lady Persia.
Please...
don't stare at me so much, I'll be exposed.
He's so cute!
We're your bros!
This town and the Dahlia Academy
It's all reserved.
If you're looking for Julio, he just ran--
Julio!
Yeah, a full day out!
What's wrong? Can't swim?
We were just messing around with Inuzuka.
The wig was starting to make my head itch.
I just went to the restroom to take it off.
Hey, what's your definition of a date?
Eating? Shopping?
Why does it always end up like this?
My passion so intense, my heart yearns
You don't wait for your dreams, you sprint forward
Next time, Romio and Princess Char.
It's the Dahlia Academy Senior High Sports Festival!
I'll secure that MVP title, and make Persia...
The opening ceremony will now commence.
One MVP from each grade will be chosen from the winning house.
Do your best and aim for the MVP title!
Inuzuka, go get them!
Scott! If you lose, you'll be shaved clean!
-That's a harsh punishment! -On your marks.
-Let's go! -You're useless!
Amazing, Somali!
All the runners must run atop this bridge.
That's custom-made, extra-sharp glass.
How will you run across that with your delicate feet?
That wraps up the first half of the contest. We'll now have a one-hour break.
Wait!
There are only three games left! Who will claim the glory?
It's time.
Somali! Thank--!
The current score is 250 for the Black Doggies, and 300 for the White Cats.
What was that...?
Now with the White Cats in the lead, we move on to the coed relay.
-But-- -I'm fine.
You've let us all down. I don't need to tell you the kind of chance you've wasted--
You all feel the same, don't you?
-You think you're cut out to lead the White Cats? -Are these guys Aby's...?
That's right!
We've finally come to the final event, the Cavalry Battle!
The Black Doggies and White Cats are tied at 300 points.
Let the games begin!
Please, Maru.
Inuzuka is...
-Hasuki! -Scott!
What's happening?
Now we'll just take down Inuzuka's unit.
The Black Doggies have three units remaining against the White Cats' 10.
The Black Doggies are completely outnumbered!
Once I found and threatened that water boy,
Come at me yourself.
Why don't you just go on...
Persia! Get out here!
-Let's go! -Come at me!
Finish this already!
I've got you!
Soft... and squishy...
Done in by a boob!
Shaving time. Shall we?
Then where? What do you plan to shave?
Then we can do a dance from Touwa.
If you don't, you won't be able to see me mop the floor with this guy.
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.
Goodness.
I haven't seen her since the sports festival.
Hey there, my pretty, pretty, pretty princess.
Is that necessary? Get it together!
Per-Per's soft little hand...
I'll nurse you back to health. So just sleep peacefully.
Of course, I'll bear the responsibility that comes with it on my own.
But, I'm so moved that she'd come to nurse me.
Your room looks dismal.
I don't care anymore.
I have to avoid people as much as possible.
Oh, here's the big hall where the study session was held.
I'm asking what year in middle school you are. Are you deaf?
Just who the hell are you?
Damn it. Why's he running? It was just a question.
Steam?
It is, it's a boy!
I'm--!
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
If that's the case, it's thanks to you.
Then why did you come here?
-You're making me curious. -It's nothing!
Why are you offended? Just tell me.
I've heard of it. We're allowed to attend it too.
Sounds good.
Hey, take a good look at our uniforms, dummy.
That's the expert pharmaceutical student, Kochou!
No, if they knew I was talking to Persia, they wouldn't bother trying to fluster me.
Where's the sequel to this?
-I'm not going. -Don't be like that. It'll be fun!
Besides, Airu told us we have to monitor the students.
-Hell if I care! -He ran away.
I don't want to sit on that.
-I didn't catch that. What? -Nothing.
We've searched the entire festival.
Crouch down over here.
Go ahead and embrace her!
Princess Char, about how much more are you...?
Those two...
Knock it off, do you want the fireworks to be canceled?
I can't just let you leave after that.
If you refuse, I'll destroy this stall.
Bring it on!
A speed-eating contest. Strength will have no bearing here!
Damn. Two on one isn't fair.
-That's not-- -I heard from someone in your class.
Those two?
Next time we're free, we're coming to hang out! You better be ready!
One okonomiyaki plea-- What?
No. Not at all.
I'm so sorry!
We didn't get to watch fireworks together, but I saw a softer side of you,
Oh, that's right.
...handheld fireworks.
Just one more week until her birthday!
What are you doing? You stabbed me!
Teria?
When Teria takes interest in someone, she follows them around.
You're going to Dahlia Street?
What? I was the one who saw it first.
what Per really wants.
I want to know!
Shell be happy with whatever I get!
How rude.
Even if the wind blows up her skirt, there's no worries!
How lame!
Are we going to wander around all damn day?
He's not a White Cat.
Shut it.
What is it?
Yeah, right. And you're too close.
and got the nickname "Tyrant Princess."
Per was angry, but she was trying to help.
-Don't move. -Radicals!
Give me a break!
But...
An arrow message? From Persia?
What's this about?
I wanna hold her!
What?
He's also Inuzuka's older brother.
What's got you this scared?
What is this? Where did you get it?
Airu overheard us chewing the fat over why you'd have a rosary.
You wouldn't happen to be colluding with a White Cats girl?
If in the midst of this, you're in communication with an enemy female,
Are you an accomplice?
Let go, Teria.
You'll be under surveillance for a week.
Not at all.
These are the results of your hard work.
They're quite good!
Hey. Isn't that Inuzuka with the student rep over there?
The student rep is as majestic as ever today.
Hey, Romio.
-Yeah! -It's tomorrow!
but he keeps his mouth shut in front of the student rep. This is refreshing.
but I'm glad you stayed in line.
to get my brother to drop his guard.
It's not about me! What I'm worried about
Persia!
It might look like just a regular birthday to you.
This view reminds me of
I guess I'm no match in my current state.
My brother's always
I need to get free and clear of the dorm for just two hours.
But it's impossible to get away without being caught.
We've got no obligation to help.
It's not that I like him.
Prefects are supposed to protect and guide the students.
I can say happy birthday.
Persia?
Why are you here? We were supposed to meet
You really weren't prepared for this?
That's what I'd decided.
Romio, about that bra I found in your room.
But what if those Black Doggies try to interfere again?
-Damn! -Calm yourselves!
If Inuzuka shows up, we'll toss him right back out!
Inuzuka? What's he doing there?
You can't run anymore.
My brother is in class.
That's not something new, you know?
Are you fine with this?
You're a bona fide idiot.
Yeah, I guess.
It's so strong.
Classes are over! Take your positions!
Per?
What are you talking about?
You look so distressed.
Dummy! How many years do you think we've been friends?
Sorry, Inuzuka.
I didn't mean to put this on you.
What did you just say?
Sorry, I'm not taking questions at this time!
These cookies... No way...
Her cookies were so bad before.
but you seem fine now.
I've dragged everyone else into this.
There she is!
We've caught you, Inuzuka.
the Aby faction was dissolved, and I was thrown out of the dorm.
You've really toughened up, I see.
I'm repenting for my actions.
Later.
That was a close one.
It's a pleasure, Inuzuka.
I really like things that are fun, you see.
In the corner room on the fourth floor.
Who are you calling...
Sieber, not the eyes!
The rep's tough! Inuzuka can't lift a finger!
I don't like making a mockery of people.
I'm aware!
A first-year of ours is on a rampage at the White Cats House!
When I heard you'd come...
I was so, so happy.
I was lying about not wanting to see you.
Today's incident made me understand.
As a prefect,
I've donned this to understand how females feel.
I might be willing to let the two of you off the hook if you can outdo me in cuteness.
Ready, and...
I have lost.
Well done, Inuzuka!
Lady Persia!
I'll be fine. Persia's watching.
why would you throw it all away to sneak out of the dorm?
-Am I wrong? -You're wrong!
You would come here with no proof, and seek to dishonor me?
Furthermore, the symbol drawn on his calendar.
-Whose bra is that? -Who knows? I couldn't answer if I tried!
Big brother the pervert!
Don't speak to me so casually.
No matter our explanations, this looks...
This is bad! Someone stop them!
I've decided to fight you with all my strength.
When the reps stepped in, The tips of the swords were hovering at their throats.
It was a dangerous bet.
When that day comes,
I knew you've been looking at me with those naughty eyes.
Then someday...
You're hopeless.
Now, go inform them.
FIRST PRINCESS OF THE WEST CHARTREUX WESTIA
Boarding School Juliet
Lady Char!
-Oh, Scott. Long time no see. -Yes.
Hey, tell a joke.
I wasn't finished.
My, if it isn't Persia.
Princess Char, my hair...
We won't be ordered around by you.
I'll corner you even further.
Please! Can't you overlook this?
Do you prefer larger ones like hers?
There's only one thing to do with traitors, a good old lynching.
I just felt like calling you.
I'll overlook this out of respect for Hasuki.
Hasuki.
So, she's not just a princess for show.
Actually, turn around.
Thanks to you, Persia, I think I'll be able to pass this test.
I get to share a room with Princess Char again, I see.
I'll have to pull out all the stops.
Announcement from the principal. Chartreux, please come to the principal's office.
Then I'll just take them all.
-Persia? Why? -We share a room.
If she comes in now, she'll see the photos.
What's the problem? Let's talk here!
What?
Why did you help me?
Don't touch me like it's nothing!
You don't wait for your dreams, you sprint forward
I thought about it a lot since then.
Yeah, let's go.

Yeah!
We're doing the training camp again this year, huh?
-Maru? -What's the problem?
You brainless pigs are only good at squealing.
Cellphones are prohibited during the tests.
Thanks to you, I'll be able to pass.
Thanks.
Does that really matter?
Hasuki isn't someone who'd start rumors.
I've known her since elementary school. I trust her more than anyone.
So you say.
That's not-- Everyone has things they keep secret.
I don't mind when it's for the Black Doggies' sake.
What's so great about that guy anyway?
I had good grades, at least.
Those words from Inuzuka were my turning point.
Why would you go so far for me?
It's because...
Hasuki...
I can't hide things from Hasuki anymore, not with the way she feels.
So hearing how you feel makes me happy, but I can't reciprocate.
I'm sorry for not telling you until now.
I see.
I thought she'd understand if I told her--
As your former friend, I will show mercy and behead you to hasten your death once you've begun seppuku.
I was naive.
What am I supposed to do now?
You could call that a miscalculation, or a hopeful presumption.
I won't let her hurt you.
-I'll settle things here, Persia. -Oh, no!
Plus, there's another reason I've come here.
I'm so worthless.
What are you spacing out for?
Yes, ma'am.
Pulling me by the hand after I had given up
Your dream had suddenly become my dream
White Cats will taste defeat!
-Show me what you're made of! -Yeah!
Don't play dumb.
M--make...?
I said it! How embarrassing.
And in that moment
With only courage to overcome these obstacles
It's fine. But haven't you been cooking since last night?
Water! Wait, water is bad for oil fires, right?
It's not...
Anyway, I'll feed you, so open your mouth.
I shouldn't have to put up with Inuzuka getting to eat it.
No matter how you look at it, there's enough for two.
You bastard!
This is quite the development.
The bento!
I can't give up yet!
you're a surprisingly normal girl with normal problems.
Boarding School Juliet
Inuzuka, you idiot!
Three more laps!
So we agree, for once.
We could put sleeping pills in the bread at the eating contest.
What's wrong? You've been pretty quiet lately.
Who are you? Where did you barge in from?
WHITE CATS FIRST-YEAR ABY SSINIA
-No, I'm upset with you. -Who are you?
Quiet, you delusional girl!
Don't mind what she says.
Once I win MVP at the sports festival, will you date me?
Why are you so upset?
I'm over here.
Are you okay?
Anyway, you're pretty determined about this sports festival.
That would help my father, too.
-All right! -Perfect!
On your marks, get set...
-If you don't fight with all you've got, I'll be angry. -Yeah...
What's with that response?
I said not to enter.
If Somali wins MVP, will Aby like her even more?
-Even if you win MVP, your stupid strength-- -Aby you dummy!
Just you and me
We are tied together by our strong determination Without anyone knowing
Boarding School Juliet
Juliet and the Sports Festival
Do your best and aim for the MVP title!
-Try to at least be useful. -Ready...
He's made up for last year's disgrace!
The scores are even, so the victors will be decided in the second half!
The seventh event is the "Stick Down"!
It's time.
Aby is my god.
Persia takes the lead!
You've let us all down. I don't need to tell you the kind of chance you've wasted--
You will regret this.
All as planned, so far.
Just wait it out for now.
I couldn't even go to Persia's side when she fell.
All I do is lose.
How could someone so pathetic change the world?
Persia!
Leave the...
beating of that guy to me!
Like I'd let you do that. I'd sooner kill you.
I'll win this in Persia's honor!
-Got it! -Oh, no!
-Can Inuzuka's unit continue like this? -We'll be just fine!
No matter. We already control the game.
The Black Doggies have three units remaining against the White Cats' 10.
Inuzuka's unit is in the worst possible place!
Don't give up!
Only two left! They're helpless!
Those two will never see eye to eye, but they're both at the top of the first-years in strength.
A stun gun?
But I have an addiction that I just can't kick.
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
Cheap, you say?
What do you know?
I'll outdo Persia, defeat Inuzuka, and claim MVP. Then...
My fury has reached its greatest limit.
With everything I have
Who knew Inuzuka was so underhanded?
Romio and Juliet and the Sports Festival
One last push! Go for it!
Finish this already!
Done in by a boob!
There's a jinx that makes the MVP and their dance partner a couple forever.
Shaving time. Shall we?
-Pull yourself together. -Persia!
Jinx? What's that?
We promised we'd have to obey one order from the MVP.
It's not like I'd refuse. Though, I don't know how they dance in the West.
If you don't, you won't be able to see me mop the floor with this guy.
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.
And first-years, the White Cats.
I've received information that cannot be ignored.
You're so hopeless, Inuzuka.
When my body gets weak, my heart always follows.
You've got a fever?
Who would want something so childish--?
Char even told you not to sneak into the Black Doggy House disguised as Julio anymore.
or anyone else decide for me.
I'll tidy it up a bit.
I see.
What's that? Do I own such thing?
Miss Persia, please look at me.
Seriously, you're mistaken!
Oh, here's the big hall where the study session was held.
Found it! The Dining Hall!
By the way, it's supposed to rain this evening.
I'm asking what year in middle school you are. Are you deaf?
Steam?
It is, it's a boy!
Inuzuka...
No, no! What am I thinking?
-You lecher. -I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.
Jeez, your clothes are so big!
Please don't think I'm an immodest girl!
Really? You still have one.
Staying here any longer is dangerous. So...
There's no reason.
You don't wait for your dreams, you sprint forward
I'll have so much fun, I'll miss my curfew.
It's probably bad to let them hear it, even if it is a joke.
They're basically proxy teachers.
These prefects with their perfect grades,
Beyond the dazzling times
Our dreams without limits
Boarding School Juliet
You two, go oversee the festival.
Sounds good.
That would make visiting the stands together pretty tough.
I'll make sure I can slip away for the fireworks.
Festival date!
Nice one, Teria!
Weird brats?
By the way, Romio Inuzuka, the problematic child...
-Are you really okay? -The ants, huh?
I don't want to get involved with them.
A bath? Or, perhaps, the two of us?
Just kidding. Did I get your hopes up?
On another note, we found this.
Why does a Touwa citizen have a rosary?
He's making tons of merry!
It's too early for fireworks, but I'd better go find some ideal vantage points.
I won't be able to meet with Persia with these two on my case.
Look at this.
I don't want to sit on that.
I'm going home. You two have fun.
He's sad because he was rejected.
Could he be...
That's not him!
-If I may interrupt... -Who are you?
-Go home! -That's right!
I think I get it now.
Not games, battles.
-Hey, what should we do next? -That's the end.
Anyway, the terms of my loss weren't decided, were they?
You can't just casually approach them.
I-- I didn't make it.
-I love... -Love?
...handheld fireworks.
BLACK DOGGY STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE AIRU INUZUKA
My passion so intense, my heart yearns
You don't wait for your dreams You sprint forward
You have something I don't, Teria.

I confess all my love for you, I swear
I was watching you with my hidden feelings from afar
So I could protect you
Boarding School Juliet
This is it!
-You're going to rip it! -You're going to rip it!
What are you doing here? What about school?
PRESENT
No! Stop, please!
Shell be happy with whatever I get!
Are you sure?
That would spell the end of your relationship.
Hey! That's basically just strings! Forget it!
You fool! Fluffy lace is obviously the way to go!
Thats perfect! White is definitely her color.
I'll say! You've got an eye for this.
Of course it's gotta be white and lacey.
I just can't decide.
It's a squall!
-Shopping? -Who knows?
What's all this about?
Whatever, just wear it.
In exchange,
You're relieved of escort duty.
You can't be so selfish.
Per was angry, but she was trying to help.
-Don't move. -Radicals!
Trying to lay your dirty paws on me...
This is a chance to give this brat what she deserves.
I hate this girl, too.
Don't get confused. It wasn't for you.
An arrow message? From Persia?
I'll be waiting in the library. From Persia.
So, Inuzuka...
Happy birthday!
It becomes a brawl and the place gets wrecked.
Got it. Leave it to me!
If they force themselves to turn with each other, they'll break down and come apart.
Curses!
Airu... Big brother...
What?!
to have Ako-senpai and Riko-senpai as sisters.
Or would you rather... have me?
No, it's not if I saw them or not... it's...
You've only seen Riko's... so unfair...
Delicious!
Hey! What are you doing?
S-Stop it!
Just a dream...
Keita-senpai!
I suppose.
Plus it should be called: Athletic Department Manager.
A fool's mistake, eh?hard to tell if he means her, or himself here... for looking-N
Ako-senpai.
I - Am - So - Happy!
They're siblings...
Suminoe Keita.
Please listen to this song I wrote.
Why didn't you come earlier?
Didn't you know that if you came, it would cause a huge riot like this?
Ako-senpai and Riko-senpai...
This is...?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
and your mum brought Ako and Riko.
This makes them even greater girls.Changed girl to plural, assuming he's talking about both of them
...our pampered boy.it seems like they're playing off of each others sentences
No, nothing in particular...
After substituting 5 for x, it's 25  5A  30.
I think I understand.
I suppose...
I don't want that to happen!
There are lots of things I want to do with you in high school!Still is unneccessary here since he's not in high school yet. oh, and it's not spoken :P
Yeah!
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't worry!
Why are you dressed like that?
It's more interesting this way.
I didn't mean it like that...
If you're talking about taking care of him, I can do that too!
No good... I can't remember it.
That's right! Just like this.
Look at something: "Look at."
In the year 794, the peace in....
Strawberry panties?!
Of course not!
Tutor?!Same here, if we don't use 'home tutor' in the beginning, we shouldn't use it here.
You see... I've always..."You see... I've always..." is a better TL hereI agree - milky
Kei-chan!
What kind...
What is that girl doing!?Like you've never done it!
Sleeping with you.
Eh?
But there's no need for a test at home...
Isn't that more of a punishment game? Shouldn't we TL the sign? -nt
In that case, I'll have to make it more....like a punishment game? I think tony-san fell asleep during this line -masatrofl, perfect lines indeed!!! like a punishment game, eh?
Calm down... Calm down.
That's ridiculous.
I actually remembered?
This is the punishment of the punishment game.
W-What, a bit nervous...
It's just a punishment game.I bet he feels SO punished right now -masat
You made it?
Could it be?he can see through the cup. badass.
Welcome back, Kei-chan.
This is all thanks to you.
Isn't this great? Kei-chan.
I see.
Mine!
That's not what happened.
Both of you be quiet!Disco! -masat
I gave you toppings too! Toppings!
You're so stingy.
For example, sweets...
Thank you.
Keita, you're fine.
Every night they're so noisy!
Damn it.
Everyone! Assemble!
If it's like this...
Dad, are you there?
And now...
How did this happen...There is no reference to what 'they' said, this looks like another TL errorSuggested: How did this happen?
It's the same as Ako's midnight snack.
Right?again, split these up -masat
Eh? What?
I'll take one more...
P-Probably like this...
Sugar and spice and everything nice!
Go eat a midnight snack!Well, i think he was about to
Liar!
Don't bully Keita!
Ako-neechan.
I wonder if I can?
You can. I'm sure of it.
no matter how much time passes,
I'm back.
Welcome home, Keita.
Only looking at Riko... It's not fair...
Here! Kei-chan.
Ako-nee and Riko-nee are really innocent.
They're just like when we were kids.
See?
These are the boxers that Keita just took off!
Really... Who's being a pervert now?
Enough already, give them to me!
N-No... It's nothing.
Kei-chan, you weirdo.
Man... such irresponsible parents...
Keita.
Kei-chan.
How did you get in?!
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Huh?
Good job out there.
Here, take this.
Plus, shouldn't it be the Track and Field Club's Manager?
In order to make our high school dream come true...
Did you just say Riko-senpai?
I'll escort you, Riko-senpai!
Ako, this way.
The sisters are the same.
They even snuck into the school a little while ago, and confessed to their brother...
Sorry...
Anyway, I'm sorry.
That's all right. Let us through!
Keita.
T-That's...
U-Um... I'm sorry.
Let me see.
You're right.
I don't want that!
Don't worry.
I passed as well, didn't I?
I won't tell you to stop, but roll that pencil a bit quieter.
Ouch...
Are you making any progress with your studying?
I'm sorry.
Not really, there were some things I could remember...
I see...
Which means...
He's a groper, a groper!
What a beast!
That's not fair, Keita-senpai!
If it's for Keita, even I can...
Tutoring you?!
She must have taught you other things as well!
Well, then what kind of studying did you do?
What kind of...?
You did get it on with your sister! check
Rub, rub...
I'm sorry, Ako-nee.
That's not the point. Why are you sleeping here?
I came to study, but you were sleeping.
So instead of waking me up, you wanted to have some fun.
I get it, then I'll just have to make it more like a punishment game.
When was the Tokugawa Bakufu abolished?
In 1573.
It seems I remember all that.
So lighthearted.
A dream, huh?
It doesn't matter, you still can't.
There's still a hidden ingredient left in there too!
But, you know...
Umm... It's got something to do with salt...
That won't work!
So this is my limit, eh?
I won't have enough.
I wish I had more...
What about it?
Keita.
It's not lipstick, it's chocolate.
B-But...
Not at all. It's just chocolate.
Huh, what?
Really?
What's wrong?
That's really true.
The next time you say something like that, I'll kill you.
We used to play around here a lot.
It's not like you're going to start saying that your little brother is the best, right?
Her brother?! Love?!
And you're so popular, Riko.
It might be that.
What is this, those creatures are called guys?!
Boys are so dirty!
They're mean.
U-Unbelievable.
We're probably wearing the true face of a girl.
You should stop by at least once in a while.
This god acts quickly.
More importantly, why don't you pray too?
praying that we could marry you.
Is that really okay?
That's why there are still a lot of people who come here for love.
And this, and that, that one there...
What's wrong?
That's right...
C'mon, let's go home.
Keita!
Girls really are all about the breasts.
The feeling of almost being able to see it and yet not being able to see it...
I need to just forget about it.
I didn't know she was the librarian.
He's not satisfied enough with his two older sisters, so if it's a cute girl then he's indiscriminate!
Huh?
Get out of here while you still can.
Damn this...
What should we do?
This isn't the time to be embarrassed.
Hey, is your underwear all right?
Jeez...
That Kei-chan...
Hey, where are you?
Um?
Yes...
Could it be? Ako-san's love target is...
It can't be! This abnormal relationship.
Right!
Five.
Why don't you try to go out with them as a test?
Maybe we should try that, too.
Yeah...
Get ready...
right now, we have no choice but to endure it.
We've been coming here everyday since you started preparing for your exams.
Stop it already!
Fail?
Oh, yeah...tlc, "I guess so"?Guess so is lit, but whatever works
Eh? What's that? Where's your offering?
You'll receive retribution.
That's not true!
Couldn't we do that now, too?
I knew all of them would wish for passing the exam.
Um? You didn't know?
That's why there are so many people that come and make love wishes, even now.
Y-Yeah...
Whether it's good or bad...
C-C'mon, you as well, Kei-chan?
Akiba residents... huh?
You've tried this before, haven't you?
Never mind that, just come up with something already.
Okay, let me try.
We are going beyond high school vocabulary here... TLC
It's useless.
We are buying an Eroge!
There's no limit to what they can do in drawings.
And it's something you can never show to a child!
No, there's no other choice.
Buying an Eroge...
Were you that dissatisfied, Riko-nee?
I'm sorry.
Anyway, I'm going to take Kei-chan with me, so in the meantime...
Well, she just had something to do.
I'm a female warrior.
Could it be that we share the same hobby?
This is it!
What are you doing here, buying these Eroge?
Got the last one.
I'm buying that one!
Well...
Ah, wait!
Y-Yeah, she should have been back by now.
Well...
Ah! I finally found you.
Well... Umm...
Who's this?
And the one that Riko-san was trying to get...
A relationship like this between brother and sister has no future.
And he just happens to be our younger brother.
That still doesn't mean...
Remember, it's first come first served!
We're going to have a good long talk about your sisters, just the two of us.
I'm going to show you how to put a stop to this forbidden relationship.
Excuse me.
Miss, what kind of cosplay would you like to order?
At this shop, the men dress up as military commanders for the women.
You have to pull yourself together.
What were you thinking, Sensei?
Did my sister cause any trouble?
This game came with a special comic from a manga that I really like.
So that's what happened.
Don't worry.
Forgive me!
Next time: WhWhat?! A dripping wet midsummer delusion.
Hmmm, what should I do?
Here!
That's just great.
Eh? Pool?
You think so?
I'll just look after it for the time being.
Ako, hurry up!
One... adult ticket!
Y-Yeah... It's just like you, Mikazuki.
Wait! They can see them!
You have to fill up the space with a pad. That's common sense.
Just forget it,
Are you talking about Mikazuki-chan?
Maybe a Peeping Tom?
OK, Ako!
Ako-nee, Riko-nee, what happened?
How lucky that you came from club practice.
Kei-chan, don't look!
Be it good or bad, we didn't bring a change of clothes.
I made a fool of myself again.
Keita-kun looked really embarrassed.
Oh no, I might really like this scent.
If I keep doing this...
If I keep doing this, I'll go insane.
Jeez... What have you been looking at all this time?
Sensei, I can't...
It's okay,
it's already like this.
Keita-kun, smell your Sensei to your heart's content.
Sensei... No...
How is this Keita-senpai, do you find me sexy in my happi?!
And go Wasshoi!! Wasshoi!!
In this case, "slut" is closest to the original meaning.
Don't forget to bring the plates back.
The three of them started acting completely different all of a sudden.
How wonderful.
It is, isn't it?
Yep, a real storm.
What are you saying? He's going with me!
I don't want to!
Hey!
We should go somewhere quiet, if we want to relax.says breather again
I'll come with you, so just let go of me!
My old yukata is kind of tight as well.
Keita!
How did this happen?
Kei-chan, do you want some too?
You kept complaining that you wanted the same one as Onee-chan.
Please, hurry up!
Again?!
Kei-chan!
Are you okay, Nee-chan?
So you're still afraid.
Huh? You don't remember?
You're such a scaredy cat.
L-Like I'm scared, I'm not a kid anymore.
Riko-nee.
Congratulations!
Like at these narrow places between the stalls...
a summer night rendezvous to climb the stairs to adulthood!
I told you to hold it.
You both look horrible.
Kei-chan?
Keita?
Next time: When times are tough, pray to the gods.
The summer has ended and the leaves have started to turn red.
If I'll end up laughing or crying all counts on how hard I work this winter!
Your old man never fails to catch the biggest tuna!
You should accept favors from your family.
But every exam student should have one, right?
The gods won't to listen to all of their prayers.
I've got it!
It's my turn this time.
I know all I can do is make a headband!
Ouch! That hurts!
you're still a kid, Keita.
Say it properly.
it was just an accident and I saw it by chance!
But I can't stop.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Doing stuff like this!
Then why don't you get out of the kotatsu?
Keita... You don't mean...
Just as I thought, Keita got bigger too.
I'll take responsibility and take care of him.
just the food and the victory headband might not be enough.
Pubic hair...
Let me have a look if you're so worried about it.
Well well, you just have to think about it for a bit.
Jeez... You idiot!
Here I go, Ako-nee.
I got one.
That hurt...
I told you that you can't, Kei-chan!
Ako, don't you think you've become really perverted lately?
I was perverted long before all of this.
How should I feel about that?
Keita...
Welcome back.
But I was wrong.
Ako, you go to bed already.
Stop that!
Stop!
But...?
Don't you ever open it!
Please, give me the strength to pass!
It always felt breezy, but now...
What about his studies?!
What are you saying?
39.2 degrees.
Yeah.
Just relax.
Keita, you're sweating.
I feel like I'm going to faint.
Are you guys still going to continue?
Keita.
I'll just leave everything to you guys.
Have a safe trip....faggotry again
You'll be fine.
Ako-nee...
Yeah, somehow.
he's just another exam student right now.
I mean, BEGIN!
Of course,
Yes, "that".
Well, that's settled then.
Mine?! Why?!
You're such a scatterbrain.
If you can tackle it as your usual selves, you'll both do just fine.orig. If you just go for it like you normally would, it'll be okay.wut
That's right.
Yeah, he was the best.
Who cares...
Even more than us, his older sistersliteral: elders.TLC'd
I'm back!
Riko-nee?
When I think back on it, maybe I was a little strange as well.
If I don't make it, then there's nothing I can do about it.
but I was able to give it everything I had until the very end.
Huh? They really are sleeping.
What can I say...?
You sure did it, Keita.
Yeah, yeah!
Wow, that looks good!
You're wearing a different scarf today.
It cleans it all right up!
It'll clean off so well, you'll be shocked!
We should be okay now.
Yeah, we're finally here.
It's none of your concern!
Eh? No way.
Keita-senpai!
Don't you worry your pretty little head about it!
As colleagues, we'll do our best to look for a high school next year!though colleagues sounds a bit off
Huh? Where's Keita?
Isn't that right, Kanetsugu-sama?
"I'll definitely get into the same high school as you two."
Come to think of it, wouldn't it make more sense for me to apologize?
Coming...
Ah! Kenta!
This board is for those who have been put on the waiting list for acceptance.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee... I did it, I really did it!
Huh?
I was able to make it...
Yeah!
What?!
Kei-chan, congratulations on passing your exam!
That's right! Our glamorous highschool life has only just begun!
What would I have done if Mikuni didn't bring me that acceptance letter?
Ah! Senpai!
Yeah. But aside from that, our buttons-- wait, what?!
All of his buttons are gone!
You even said that you'd save two for us.
You're awful, Keita-senpai!
I'll start.
And fourth...
O-Okay...
Here we go!
There's no way that that's going to turn him on.
It doesn't seem like I have the right to refuse it, so let's just get it over with.
This kid doesn't know when to stop. TLCWe can't underestimate this kid.
Embarrassing hairs? I don't have any of those. You saw that, didn't you?
Last come, best served, eh?
Kei-chan looks really turned on!
Nice one, Riko!
But, but... don't you think that changing what you already wrote down seems a bit too selfish?
This is...
Oh yeah, Suminoe-kun doesn't know that I'm going to Tamahide High School as well.
Thank you.
Phew, I finally said it.
Goddamn it.
Kei-chan.
Just deal with it.
Give us one of your buttons.
That's already gone!
Why?
Kei-chan...
aogeba toutoshi wa ga shi no on
ima koso wakareme
iza saraba
Riko.
Just wait for me, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Even if you get chased by those dogs again, we'll be here to protect you.
Really?
But you're a boy Keita, so one day you'll have to stand up for yourself.
a spoiled little boy.
If you lie, we won't forgive you!
These fantasies...
Or have a bath?
You saw Riko's, didn't you?
R-Riko! When did you...?
These are the boxers that Keita just took off!
It's your fault for sneaking away.
We're the only ones here tonight.
Why?
Huh?
It's already become like this.
Keita...
I-I suppose.
Keita-senpai, please wait a little bit longer.
turning down the recommendation to try to get into our high school yet...
Teacher!
And Riko-senpai.
I - Am - So - Happy!!
Get out of the way!
Mikoni, are you ok?
T-That's...
I have something really important to do today.
So you two should just hurry and go home.
I guess we did something unnecessary.
This is...
Ako-nee and Riko-nee came here for this?
N-No, but...
So Keita, are you going to marry Ako?
...a spoiled little boy.
I will teach you Ako-sensei's secret studying method.
Next time, a lesson with just the two of us.
Kei-chan?
Don't worry.
Hold on!
Damn it, I can't lose my focus!
I guess so.
Ako has always had excellent grades.
This isn't something to laugh about.
Oh my, what a shame.
Oh, it seems I have nothing to say in this matter.
Okay, let's change our strategy.
That's because this is a special lesson.
"be glad to."
"F-Finally!"
"Look at."
"To be happy while doing something."
I'm sorry!
So, you aced your English test right?
You don't get these grades just like that.
Something like this, I guess.
Then I have to give you a reward for working so hard.
I'm sorry, Ako-nee.
So instead of waking me up, you wanted to have some fun.
Don't change the subject.
If you hate it that much, just answer correctly!
Whatever, this is just a game, right?
Riko!
So lighthearted.
Thanks for the food!
Welcome home, Kei-chan.
Good for you, Kei-chan.
And lots of other great stuff!
You are both at fault!
I'm already tired enough from exam-studying!
Really?
Keita-senpai!
I made this during home-ec!
And then like this...
Using money just feels wrong.
This is impressive, Riko-nee, you really outdid yours-
Are you done?
Oh, sweets!
Keita, you're so focused right now.
This time I'll put some on your tongue, so stick it out.
Oh no. It's getting so wet.
Hey, do you remember?
Some sugar and spice, and a lot of other wonderful things!
Girls are like really sweet candy.
Oh, sweets!
Next time: A Lover's Capabilities
Bigger breasts are...
These curves... I can't hold it anymore!
Nothing.
You don't have any interest in girls, other than Ako and Riko-senpai.
I'm home.
Of course, but...TLCIs "but" better or "however"?
Woah! I've recovered my health!
Damn it!
Test into high school!
Concentrate!
I'm taking exams!
Kei-chan.
Of course, I have to apologize.
W-Why is that guy here of all places.
being overly friendly to a high school girl.
He's not satisfied enough with his two older sisters.
W-Wait a moment.
No, Suminoe-kun is wiping my...
Where did you go?
Again, over there.
Yeah.
Aren't they cute?
Are you forgetting that you also have daughters around that age?
This is boring...
Well, yeah...
He's a boy.
What should I do?
If you showed some interest, they'd be lining up to be your boyfriend.
But, you might have a point.
They're violent and perverted.
Keita-senpai!
You should stop by at least once in a while.
This god acts quickly.
Thank you.
What are you doing, what about your offering?
When you were little, you used all of your New Year's money here,
That's not true, if you ask the gods, it can be done.
Why not?
This one, as well.
Because... Because I can't help it!
In a place I don't know...
My sisters will...
Kei-chan?
Gosh, without even knowing how we feel.
No, don't, Suminoe-kun is...!
Oh my, what a youthful scene.
Girls other than Ako and Riko...
Dispel my lust.
Kei-chan.
This won't do, I need to wake up!
Let's go!
But I don't even know her name.
We've got to take care of his health while he's studying for the exams, right?
But... The timing...
Kei-chan, where are you?
We have no other choice, we'll have to do "that".
Get on.
Stop it.
No no no!
Hey, Keita!
Where did you go?
Uneasiness at Akiba.
What the hell is this all about?
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
If you want to hide a tree, you should do it in a forest, right?
There's got to be a way to get around it and view those adult sites.
"Piss-mania."
"Lesbians."
It decided...
We are buying an Eroge!
There's no limit to what they can do in drawings.
And it's something you can never show to a child!
Riko, you know what to do, right?
That's right.
Buying an Eroge...
I'm sorry.
I should have noticed...
Get real.
I get the feeling you guys are hiding something from me today.
But I don't want them to do that.
Kei-chan, are you done changing?
What's up with that outfit?!
I'm a female warrior.
Hey! Keep it down!
S-Sensei...?
W-Wasn't that...
Just let go of it... Already...
What are you doing here, buying these Eroge?
I'm buying that one!
Ah, wait!
Maybe I should go look for her?
Thank you very much.
Well...
You must be... Suminoe Ako-san's...
And he just happens to be our younger brother.
This is bad, I have to do something about this kid.
Cosplay?
At this shop, the men dress up as military commanders for the women.
It's a kind of flirting game.
Well, if you say that while I'm wearing these clothes...
You've got to be stoic, just like the warriors in the Warring States era.
For one, I think they're the greatest sisters I could have.
I'm going home.
What were you thinking, Sensei?
I've found you, Onee-chan.
Thanks, Onee-chan.
Since I'm under-aged, I couldn't buy it.
Samurai code...
Yes, of course.
Seriously.
Next time: WhWhat?! A dripping wet midsummer delusion.
There's still 10 days left until my next payday.
If all goes well, I can overcome my financial difficulties.
But I'm a teacher. I can't just start gambling, or my reputation would...
How many cups of instant noodles could I buy with this kind of money...
A swimsuit should be practical in the first place.
Y-You both... look really great.
Wait! They can see them!
A pad?
I don't need a swimsuit.
It can't be helped.
You want to wait?
Maybe a Peeping Tom?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee, what happened?
Even though we told you that there's no problem, since we aren't blood relatives.
But that is nothing to be ashamed of.
Wh-What are you doing, changing here in front of the guys?
It might be a little...
I made a fool of myself again.
There.
Oh no, I might really like this scent.
Wearing this jersey while I'm naked...
Sensei, I can't...
It's okay,
Oh, that won't do,
B-But...
Huh?
Why am I wearing this jersey?
You've got it all wrong, Sensei!
Do you want to grope me?!
Yams from Tottori are just 80 yen!
They seem to have calmed down.
This is what the ideal relationship between an exam student and his sisters should look like.
Taking a breather, taking a breather
You see, it's so crowded and so hot
Don't be so unreasonable,
Ah, that's right.
I'll come with you, so just let go of me!
Are you all right?
Is this okay?
This looks delicious!
It did!
Hello little chicky, hello.
What's this? All of a sudden...
Nee-chan!
Are you okay, Nee-chan?
What are you saying, Riko-nee?
It was when we came here when we were little.
You're not afraid, are you?
I have to stop them. It's my duty as a teacher, as an adultfscx200-
That's what education, no, love, that's what love is all about!
Kei-chan!
I could say the same about you.
Keita?
The summer has ended and the leaves have started to turn red.
The gods won't to listen to all of their prayers.
Thank you!
I'm so glad.
OK, let's do this!
No problem.It's "osomatsusama", just a reponse to "gochisousama" that weeaboos don't know :P Moshi
We've got some apples for dessert.
Your height for example!
Gosh...
D-Did what?
I'm sorry...
Sorry! Was that too strong?
...nothing.
Then why don't you get out of the kotatsu?
Aren't you going to eat the apples?
Of course I'll eat some! I'll eat them!
You sure collected a lot.
you might start doing unnecessary searches.
Who would have thought that you really would count them...
H-How does it look?
Will there be any results with just this little?
It's fine. It should get more powerful once we add mine.
But how am I...
Really?
Don't! Not there!
This is way too embarrassing to be doing it in front of someone else!
Kei-chan...
Actually, there is one thing I feel I should reflect upon. meh
But I was wrong.
How did we end up making such an embarrassing thing...
We completely missed our chance to go back since we were so in the moment.
There is one thing you have to be careful about with this charm!
Well...
All we can do now is take care of him, I guess.
...to get taken care of.
But you see...
Keita...
I'm licking his sweat off.
Why are you licking only my nipples?!
I feel like I'm going to faint.
I'm all covered in sweat.
Just lie still.
They're really trying to cure my cold...
I'll just leave everything to you guys.
We can't do that.
Riko-nee...
Honestly, thanks a lot!
Hey, are you okay?!
What's this? I don't even... What was that all of a sudden...?
Keita, you idiot.
Yeah, somehow.
First off, your exam ID is on the top right of your desk.
I can't just discriminate against him.
Regardless of any difficulties, I must do what needs to be done quickly.
You mean you're shivering.TLC'd
Let's call a truce.
AHH?!
I forgot my exam ID!
Seriously?
What am I doing to do?
Kei-chan!sup dear?
Good luck!
But Ako-san,
why are you sleeping in my bed?
Don't tell me you're going to say, "I breezed through that?"
Ako-nee?
They really are cute.
What can I say...?
It's finally here!
Kei-chan will get accepted no matter what.
I always knew you could do it!
That's my boy! Way to go, Keita!
You didn't forget anything, did you?
Look, this is my "lucky item."
It cleans it all, guaranteed!
Viva our high school days, Riko-senpai!
Something is definitely wrong.
Get her to stop this foolishness at once.
But to accept the challenges that it brings on is also the way of love! But, accepting that head on is also a way of love.
Why...
But keep in mind that if I manage to get in next year, we'll only be able to spend one year together.
S-Sure...
Okay!
Umm... Mikuni... Mikuni Miharu-san, was it?
Suminoe-kun?
This board is for those who have been put on the waiting list for acceptance.
orig. We've send out the forms to both those who've passed and those who've been put on the waiting list.Those who have passed and been put on the waiting list for acceptance both will have their forms mailed.
Kei-chan...
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
Thank you, my middle school life.
I, too, will be a high school student this spring.
That's right! Our glamorous highschool life has only just begun!
Loosen up a bit, man!C'mon, talk back a bit, will you?
You're awful, Keita-senpai!
You promised it to Mikazuki-chan?
Sheesh. You guys are persistent.
Ladder Lottery!
Out of all of the prizes, this collar is the only miss.dud, maybe?
How.. how could this happen?
Next up is "The right to have Keita-senpai flip my skirt"?
Yeah, I wrote this one.
"The right to be able to censoredOO alone with Keita for 5 minutes in the P.E. storage shed...?"
Good point...
Oh yeah, Suminoe-kun doesn't know that I'm going to Tamahide High School as well.
Thank you.
Don't worry! I don't care if you're a quick shot, Keita-san!
Don't say such things!
And why were you passing up on my graduation ceremony? Just how irresponsible can these parents be?
My my, that was your dad's.
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Thank you for everything up to now. I'm almost a high school student, huh?
Riko and I... will do this together...
Kei-chan.
Keita.
Didn't we promise that we'd get him off together?!
Kei-chan's button.
For us?
How should I act when I bump into him there?
Riko.
Let's just stop.
When it really does happen, I want...
Well then.
Liars eventually become thieves, you know that, right?
Guess I don't have a choice.
I guess we're going to have to hold his hands.
Keita.
Kei-chan.
Let me kiss you good morning, I'll smooch your sleeping face.
be1I think of that smile of yours.
Which will give us Ako-senpai and...
What are you filming?
I-I'll pay you back for this.
Really?
Oh, that's okay.
Bring it on.
What'll I do?
Oh god, it's still leaking out.
Oh no, I...
I can't hand this in!
I'm also good at this!
That's...
Is that so?
I didn't get anything.
Huh?
What are you saying? Mikuni-san is still in high school!
I'm not into grown-up women whose boobs can't compete with high-school girls!
I'm not smaller!
You're gonna need a checkup.
No, nothing's wrong.
Already off.
Eighty-seven?!
I wonder if Keita-senpai likes them big?
Same as last year, huh?
I'm not going to lose!
Yes, we're all girls here, but come on!
What? Dammit!
How about now?!
Oh, right!
Exactly 38 kilograms.
Why did you do that?!
So we ended up getting...
Actually...
I can't wait!
If you have a PC, you can use the internet.
Hide a tree in a forest, right?
But why only me?!
What are you doing? Let's go.
We were up all night, too.
It's designed to keep children away from porn sites.
What do we do?
You've tried that before, haven't you?
It's gonna catch that!
Peeing, urination, piss-maniac...
Wait, Kei-chan, it's a misunderstanding!
Failure is not acceptable.
Leave it to me. Mission start!
Kei-chan, this way, this way.
C-Cosplay?!
A female warrior.holy cow those cat ears are real she just moved them! -masat
Ako-nee, w-wait!
This calls for education!
Doing perverted things are bad! Koutetsu-tenshi Kurumi reference, is there a official way to translate this?
What's she doing here?
Lucky! There's still one left. The last one is mine.
Y-Yeah. I bet she'll be back soon.
Thank you very much.
S-Suminoe Ako-san?
Sensei, are you by any chance... an otaku?
Help me with this, Kanetsugu-sama!
Ahh, I finally found you!
Even if siblings love each other, they won't have a future!
...because we're not related by blood to Keita.split -masat
And you, don't you care that your sisters say they love you?
This is the time for a teacher to shine!
Excuse me.
Cosplay?
In this store, the man would put on armour and allow the woman to serve him.split, please check time - Nanakotoadjusted -masat
F-Flirting game?
Then I shall do as you say!
Ahh! Nobunaga-sama! More please, more please!TLC Added, please check time - Nanakoto
What were you thinking, Sensei?
Thank you, Onee-chan. You bought the game for me.
But that's an eroge...
You two get along well.
Mikazuki, this is embarrassing!
Keep it together, Yuzuki!
But, but, a little is fine, just once more, just five minutes!
Next episode:
and that's fine
No way! I'm not going to let you capture me!
This is summer vacation! At the ocean! An adventure!
What'll happen if you don't don't take this opportunity to liberate your body and soul and let everything hang out?
You need to burn as brightly as the summer sun!
Kei-chan, let me join in.
Keita!
That's not good.
Kiryuu-sensei's clothes?
So take off your pants and underwear!
I'm sorry. I'm such a...
Enough of that, settle down!
Who'd think a younger girl would be so scary?
This has been a valuable experience.
But you've been putting up with it up so calmly.
What's with this?
You're used to it?
I think I know where this is going.
I'm just playing. It looks like you'll have to stop seducing me!
No, this is not...
Mikadzuki, it's me!
Squee! This is it!
Mikadzuki, you're still in your uniform.
Here, put it on a hanger.
If my sister catches us right now, we won't know what to tell her.
Your uniform isn't that wet.
That's dangerous, Mikadzuki!
A real guy only has disgusting thoughts running through his head!
You'll always remain a virgin if you keep that up.
Don't you have any prospects at your school?
You have your back turned like you're embarrassed.
What's this?
A large peach, and a small peach...
You're right, that looks very young.
Onee-chan!
Suminoe... kun?
I... I'm back.
Then, I'll be going braless!
I swear as a teacher and by Kanetsugu-sama that I will straighten you out!
and that's fine
He's our HONEY BOY, our SHY BOY and we'll split our love for him evenly
I think of that smile of yours
So this room...
I-I knew it!
Keita, what are you doing to us?
Suminoe-kun cant possibly be normal!
Any healthy high-school boy has a couple of those lying around!
I-Is that so?
Well, Id like to, but...
Summer break is when boys and girls get into all sorts of mischief...
Its more than enough!
Allow me to confess.
Wait, does she have a thing for me?
Your erection got bigger.
Sensei?
Oh my!
How are you? Im Keitas father.
Im his teacher, Kiryuu Yuudzuki.
By all means, take your time.
How would you like some sushi in return for making a man out of Keita?
I shouldnt have done a home visit.
You only realized that now?
At least I now know where youre coming from.
That was awesome.
This is getting even fishier!
I dont see any porn.
We wont let you jerk off to other girls besides us!
If youre going to masturbate to someone else...
Then masturbate to me, Kei-chan!
Hey, Ako-nee
Keita-dono!
Huh? Dont you know, Riko?
He's our HONEY BOY, our SHY BOY and we'll split our love for him evenly
Always under the same roof
That's normal, I'm happy for you
Embracing
His older sisters names are Ako and Riko.
Honestly, why are our parents going on an overnight pleasure trip with the neighborhood association?
Ill take care of Kei-chan for you.
overlapIll answer the phone whenever you call!
there were reports of lewd acts when the basketball team
Tonight well be all alone, together.
Either?
So you might as well get it out of the way now.
My ice cream will melt!
W-Well...
Your brain cant function if it lacks sodium.
Damn you!
Kei-chans resistance to my temptations has been steadily waning lately.
Kei-chan, youre kidding, right?
It must really stink by now.
How could something so embarrassing feel so good?
Suminoe-san?
Oh, watermelons?
Sure.
If youre going to poke fun, do it after tasting the real me.
Isnt it obvious?!
But we arent at school!
You caught us before we got there!
Why would I do that?!
...always trying to get a jump on me!
God! God! God! God! God!
Youd make a good hall monitor if it werent for your kid brother.
Dont try to fool me!
You swear?
C-Cross my heart.
And whats this thing thats been knocking on my door?
You didnt even have to lick her there.
collected a lot of sweat!
Hey! A little help?!
Wait, Ako-nee!
Ouch!
I'm sorry.
Stop it!
I'm not in the mood, and the bath doesn't exactly remind me of the ocean.
I just took a detour on my way home,
since there was something I was asked to pick up,
But...
I can't believe we're sharing an umbrella.
I'm wearing them now...
It also smells kinda different.
So, Keita-senpai...
Um... let's see...
If you can, I'd like to use your milk.
weren't you joking with me rather coolly earlier?
Oh crap!
You're going to have to take it off no matter what now!
Don't, you can't!
Mikazuki? Are you not here?
Did you get it?
What are you planning to do now?
But that's dangerous!
But that has nothing to do with...
That's a fantasy world, so it's fine.
No...
Me?
Why should I be with Suminoe-kun...?
I didn't think she'd be interested in real boys.
I guess the fun has to wait until next time.
I'm surprised we didn't get caught.
No... well... I didn't think anything...
Doesn't matter; just put something on!
Your front and back is split in two...
We worked really hard to get it like this in one day
Watch how our hips move!
Aren't we supposed to be the main characters?
Why not?
Does this really...
...have any merit?
I don't care if he's obsessed with huge breasts!
I'm going!
Didn't we agree to stop doing things that might distract him from his studies?
Ahh! I want to get into his bed!
Well, this is how a boy's room looks like.
Slut SisterX2!!!
But who the hell would call out the title that loud?
N-No... Lately my sisters don't enter my room...
Yes, isn't that natural?
What would you do?
Riko, your jokes have become severe lately...
Just like any other girl!
Well, not those kind of holes.
Shall we try a rehearsal?
There's no way I would do something that embarrassing! I would rather sit on-
Kei-chan!
This the first time for both of us, so we have to follow the book accordingly.
They are hard!
N-Nothing...
That's not true!
No! If you do it that strong-!
Really?
No... It's almost as if I were being sucked by Keita...
No... This is too strong!
I'm coming!
Kei-chan!
Riko!
Ako!
Did we want to go that far?
The actual performance will be with Keita.
Didn't you just hide something?
...That you're definitely more perverted than Riko-nee.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
A threesome is dirty after all!
What's that?
so stealing a march on me is a no no
You are our Honey-Boy, Shy-Boy, let's split his love into two halves!
Let me watch over your future
Jeez. Its your own fault for skipping meals for two days straight because of your pride.
And we get to see how much all the cute girls weigh!
There's no way in hell we'd let this perfect chance get away!
Never!
No way.
Never!
Ahhh. The line to the toilet made this take forever.
You think Im gonna let you catch me?
I'm definitely not going to lose!
Tamahide is doing their physical checkups today.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Alright!
What should I do?
Replace! Replace! Replace! Replace! Replace!
If you have so much trouble pissing, let me help you!
Now I'll try like this...
I have confidence in this one.
Yahoo! I win!
Today was the release date of that thing you wanted.
And I went out of my way to stand in line since morning just to buy it for you.
Im not losing this time!
To make us measure up at the same time as this monster-tits girl!
See? Look.
That cant be. Im an adult and I havent even been there...
I've got no interest in someone with boobs which're smaller than a highschooler's!
So rough!
So slutty.
Just measure me already.
Our weight comparison competition!
That Ako! Shes taking off her clothes to win?
I know it is only girls in here, but its still inappropriate!
Even after all that I'm still 10 grams too heavy?!
Just 38 kg.
Doing the obvious.
Kazuki! Did you get that?
Hey! Hand over the camera!
Kei-chan, you...
Right, Kei-chan?
Good point. And I hear Kiryuu-sensei and the others are coming along too for some reason...
Seriously?
Okay! Well protect Keita from the others.
What should I do?
I'll give you a massage to show my appreciation.
That's great.
Toda's with them?
Which one should I wear?
Well, I guess you won't be needing this then.
Here you go. That will be 2500 yen.
Yeah, just one pair.
I don't need a swimsuit.
It can't be helped.:D -masat
As a teacher, I was just trying to get you back on the right path as a person...
When you were at our age, weren't you more promiscuous?
Suminoe-kun?
Well, that might be...
It's not only Ako-san and Riko-san; I bothered their little brother Keita as well.
Following Uesugi Kenshin's sudden death, in the sixth year of the Tensho period during the Otate War,
I'll keep showing it to you until you get tired of it... to help you concentrate on your studies.
Your sisters' are a little disappointing, aren't they?
Sensei.
Yo, what you doing! Get yo' ass out of bed!
Huh?
I'll give you a kiss!
In this case, the word "slut" is closer in meaning.
Come and buy it!
How... How is it? Does it feel good?
A-Ako-nee!?
I'll leave your supper on the desk.
Just leave it outside when you're done.
Those three have become pretty lively lately.
At least let us have one more look!
Annoying.
Is this all right?
I'm fine with sticky.
Because it's a festival? Is it because it's a festival?
Kei-chan, get it out.
The toilet...
He's coming with me this time!
Kei-chan!
When we got lost and went into a forest...
You used to be such a scaredy-cat.
Go? As in go where?
Very well.
Let's go!
I said wait!
...her best.
Hehe... I'm this year's Ms. Mikoshi!
Let's go!
Both of you are in awful shape.
O-Oi! Where are you going?!
Doing your best, aren't you?
OK, let's try hard. Thanks, Riko-nee!
I sure will, for your sake as well!
You're eating like you haven't had any dinner.
I get the feeling I'm going to pass with flying colours! We do use british english, right? -Pipelynx
Riko-nee, what are you doing?
You did it on purpose.
Surely, you know where your foot hit me.
You already accidentally saw my pussy. "tamatama mou bobo mita" bobo is crude slang for "cunt", so I recommend at least "pussy" - EroYatsu
Don't say pussy! "bobo to ka iu na!" EroYatsu
Don't stare at me like that.
Is it disgraceful for a sister to get off on her little brother's foot?
At least say you'll take responsibility.
These are just thin sweatpants so I can feel her toes...
You doing this alone worries me.
I'm not!
Oh, there's something that looks good.
Pubic hair.
I counted them!
So that's that.
Now that I've calmed down, a greater problem arises.
It hurts, Kei-chan!
I don't have that many. I'm going to look like an infant!
What are you saying?
I pulled one out.
Now then...
The truth is, I have something I really need to reflect on.
I now know that each and every one of them is extremely important.
It's done!
Let's make it clear that the contents of this charm will stay a secret between the two of us.
I understand. I'll never open it. "Zettai" makes it have a little stronger emphasis than just "won't" - EroYatsu
I put it on, see!
Now I can show it to the world.
Keita came down with a high fever just before the important exams.
What are you saying? As you are ill, Bee: TLC said "rely" is more fitting, so I reworded it this way. orig: Leave the care of the patient
It won't work. I'll be a junior high schooler forever.or I'm doomed to be a jhs-er forever.
Idiot! What the hell are you doing now? or "...doing right now?" lit. at this moment, implying she's doing something that shouldn't be done in this situation.
Ah, hey!
That hurts!
You got excited.it's probably 'you'. kanjiru is the verb 'to feel', and it seems like keita is the one doing the feeling of the licking
Ah! She's whispering something into his ear!
Eh, even Ako-nee!
Ah, stop it!
Hey! Stop doing as you please right now!
They're really trying to catch my cold.
Keita.
My head and body feel light!
Hey, are you OK!?
So you really did get it?! Huh?
First, the exam voucher should be in the upper right side of the desk.
U-Um...
What should I do, what should I do?
What should I do?
Ako...
It was just laying on the desk. You're too careless.
Good luck, Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
That's not something a high school girl should say.
She's slowly losing it because of her cold.
Kei-chan.
I pray for you to pass the exam.
My sisters are with me...
That's why... I'll definitely...
Why are they sleeping together?
Well, it's better than when they're fighting.
I did my best until the end. This is all because you were both there for me.
R-Riko.
You did it, Keita.
A little longer, I guess.
You can't come in!
Huh? Ako-nee.
That scarf is different from the one you usually wear, right?
Isn't it mine?
Look.
How about you start to like me, Ako-senpai!
I got these drink service discount coupons from the karaoke in front of the station, and some other coupons... - NeWbY
This is definitely weird.
Be quiet!
Keita-senpai!
Huh?
Let's try our best in next year's entrance exams!
We wanted to give you a surprise...
Secretly, the two of us...
We're sorry.
...sorry!
I'm always troubling you two and behaving like a spoiled child.
But...
Mikuni.
This is?!
I was surprised.
I'm really sorry.
I repeat...
You will catch a cold, Keita.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
Kei-chan...
Accepted...
Kei-chan, congratulations on graduating!
From spring onwards, the three of us will be together again.
Thank you, my middle school life.
We got over this dark exam lifestyle.
Mine!
Damn you, Keita!
OK, since it's like this...
Each person will write down one of their desired mementos and we will use them to play Amidakuji.
Anyway, you should write something too.
Just do whatever you like...
Keita-senpai, focus on me and burn the image into your mind, OK? TLC -Pipelynxbetter way to phrase this? - Nanakoto
Kei-chan isn't dissatisfied or anything.
Nice, Riko.
My, my, isn't changing the conditions for yourselves a bit unfair?
If I remember correctly...
but you should find someone at your new school.
Be careful!
It's OK! I don't mind if Keita-senpai is a fast one.
Who is it...? Who is controlling me?
Keita-senpai, give us your buttons!
S-Stop it! These are for my sisters!
This is...?
Keita.
Since it's new year, I'll try my best at wearing this.
Yeah.
You just said you hadn't changed.
Keita, you lied.
We'll hold hands, I guess.
That's not it.
I wonder if I can?
Forever.
A spoiled, little boy.
Just what is the reason for your lack of sleep?!
You're not lying, right?!
Now, let's try this again.
Welcome home, Keita.
You saw them, didn't you?
Me?
Keita didn't wanna look at your small boobs.
You're being a pervert.
Enough already, give them to me!
Don't worry about it.
Instead, here you go Kei-chan.
Did you need something from them?
We can't do this!
All the other third years are busy studying, but you still exercise in the mornings...
Ako-senpai! Riko-senpai!
Please listen to the song I wrote.
Why?
Even if you guys like it, I don't!
Only Ako and Riko-senpai, that's so unfair!
Don't be embarrassed.
Are you alright, Kei-chan?
I realize that it's bad, but I just couldn't concentrate.
You have to get it together. If not, then you're not going to get accepted into high school!
I get that, but what's with that outfit?
That might be, but...
it's just...
Not that!
It can't be helped, I just taught you the wrong way.
I thought that you wouldn't forget if I teach you this way.
"be glad to."
What a beast!
Studying is you top priority for now.
What's going on, Keita?
Trying not to break the skin...
Next is the cucumber.
Rub, rub...
W-What is she doing?
Yeah.
She's finally helping me study for those tests...
I'm sorry, Ako-nee.
N-No! This is just fine...
If you hate it that much, just answer correctly!
In 1333.
There is just...
That's right, this is a punishment game.
What kind of studying is this?
That I couldn't help with...
So lighthearted.
You mean...
Thank you.
I'm back!
And just a pinch of something wonderful.
Because this isn't a kiss.
So sweet.
A kiss to you.
No, mine is!
Wait a second!
Kisses are banned!
Do your best!
Well, if youre still saying something like that, I won't put it in for you!
It sure is!
I've been getting more gray hair lately... Well, I guess it can't be helped...
Perhaps I should start preparing for an exam, too!
Like what?
No, no, no.
From the start, you've got to give your enemy...
Give your enemy...
Thanks.
Ready to do "this" and "that" with you...
And they do even more amazing things than they do for you at school, huh?
I-It's not like that!
Keita-senpai!
What is this all of a sudden? I don't understand any more...
Alright! I'll just have to borrow some.
Dad, are you in there?
Oh! Sweets!
Keita.
And now...
Lipstick?
It's just chocolate.
Together with Ako's cooking, I want to support you while you're studying.
That's right, support you.
What's more important, I really want to start eating that chocolate. May I?
I'm sorry I dirtied your pants.
Riko-nee.
Hey, do you remember?
Sweet... spot?!
I-It's not what you think!
Next time: A Lover's Capabilities
D-D-D-Do you guys need help getting changed?
Like they say, he's a man so he must stand erect!
We used to play around here a lot.
I want to have those wonderful days back!
Dad was saying that men are supposed to stand alone sooner or later.
If you showed some interest, they'd be lining up to be your boyfriend.
W-Well, actually...
We can't keep running around with a brother complex.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Once in a while, you have to go home a little early.
Where am I going? Home, of course.
Riko-nee?
But, what are you two doing here?
Well, we were just... You see...
We've been coming here every day since you started studying for the exams.
And we've been really praying for you, that's not very cute of you.
praying that we could marry you.
Are you sure about this?
That was all you had saved up til now.
Both of them is impossible.
That's right. And since we're here, we can just have the wedding now.
It was to get feelings to bloom and win someone's love.
Doing this won't do anything!
Thank you for being so serious... But even if these people confess here...
Just watch. I'm going to get in Tamahide High for sure!
Ako.
What's up with this? It's awkward.
I mean it!
I smell a lucky pervert.
You can't lose to cheating!
She was looking over here... I wonder if she's still angry?
O-Of all the places, why is that guy here?
If you let your guard down for only a second...
Like any sister would.
I'm about to burst.
This door is way too strong.
Ah, don't...
Ok, I got it open.
What should we do?
It's ok, I'll do that myself.
But...
We've been through a lot.
I'll take it to my grave.
Where did he run off to?
I'm for curves...
I see how it is!
Ones with this kind of feel...
Welcome back!
Nothing really.
No, but still...
Or in the hall.
My gosh!
Mom, could you give me another cup of coffee?
Yeah!
Did you hear about the new trick that Ero-Demon is using?
That's...
Eh?!
Ah, don't...
Here goes!
Huh?
Ah! A bathroom!
This is bad!
It's no use.
But it looks like it's a little bit too high up.
Stop it.
All of this is Mikuni's pee.
Hell yeah!
U-Um...
I would've been happier if it was a game console.
Keita, you're still a little kid.
A-Ako-nyan?
I see...
But why is it only me?
That's just...
Ako-nyan!
It says it can't connect.
It's got to be something to avoid the filter.
It decided...
No, there's no other choice.
Ako-nee...
Pictures?
Welcome.
Jeez... I'll give you hand.
You don't have to point that out.
Come on, just take 'em off already.
Hey! Keep it down!
No way... I guess.
More importantly, wouldn't I lose all my standing as a teacher if she saw me wearing this outfit?
Just let go of it... Already...
What is this? Some new kind of a shock? TLC
No more...
Chasing a dream, or something like that.
Y-Younger brother?!
You dropped it.
K-Kei-chan?
But, Kei-chan is...
At this shop, the men dress up as military commanders for the women.
Our most popular character right now is Naoe Kanetsugu.
Both of them are your sisters.
You've got to be stoic, just like the warriors in the Warring States era.
Like I said! You're siblings.
For one, I think they're the greatest sisters I could have.
Yeah, that's right.
This game came with a special comic from a manga that I really like.
I was so troubled by it that my sister said she'd buy it for me.
Did something happen?
That's it, Onee-chan!
You're uploading this on your blog?
I'll make sure to hide your face.
It was my performance that got you out of trouble, so you can't complain.
If I only keep doing this, I'm gonna end up a fool.
Keep up the good work, Keita-senpai.
Isn't that right, Keita?
My sisters in swimsuits...?
Then, you're staying home, right Riko?
'Sup now.
Ako, hurry up!
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Keita.
One... adult ticket!
A manequin-san with this pose was wearing it!
Which means that... You're also...
Th-They're so expensive.
Even though the admission alone is quite a blow...
Just what should I do, Kanetsugu-sama?!
To follow him all the way here, maybe she's...
Are you alive?
And this!
Jeez, what are you doing, Kiryuu-sensei?
But that is nothing to be ashamed of.
It might be a little...
It's not only Ako-san and Riko-san; I bothered their little brother Keita as well.
I've got to make sure I wash it properly and give it back.
The smell of a boy's sweat...
It really tickles my nose.
It's okay if it's only for a little while, just this once, right, Yuuzuki?
It smells a little sour, which is actually good.
If I keep doing this, I'll go insane.
Look here, your teacher's breasts are nice, right?
There's no turning back now.
Aaah, Keita-kun's tongue is inside of me!
That's right!
Do you want to grope me?!
Broth and meat and hard-boiled eggs
Don't forget to bring the plates back.
This is what the ideal relationship between an exam student and his sisters should look like.
Well, they do say that an exam student has to cram during the summer.
How wonderful.
Taking a breather, taking a breather
We should go somewhere quiet, if we want to relax.says breather again
Why am I getting all excited right now?
So we ate one with the three of us.
Did something like that really happen?
Are you okay, Nee-chan?
You're such a scaredy cat.
This is a festival... of just the two of us. meh
Congratulations!
I've got to make sure none of my students cross the line.
Keita!?
God, I'm so sorry.
She was peefscx200-
I have to be brave and...
I-I don't need her to!
Then, how about me?
This is the last leg of the race.
Thank you!
Damn you, Ako.
Like I could say that!
I'm not letting you go. I'll show you that your sister isn't a little kid anymore.
But I remember it...
Even now, really clearly...
I feel like I'm going to lose myself.
No, I want you to look at me.
Yeah, this just won't do...
I might not be able to become a bride anymore...
Then why don't you get out of the kotatsu?
What the hell are you two doing?!
just the food and the victory headband might not be enough.
That Riko, asking me such things in a place like that...
I was just tricking you into telling me.
I've calmed down, but there's still the problem at hand.
Please, take only one.
How would I know?
Wait...!
I told you, it's fine!
Together with this, the contents are all ready.
I'll never open it.
W-What the hell is this? Just what did I get?
I've got it with me, look!
We should have just given up on the whole idea!
I'll do anything if it helps him get better.
A kiss to you.
I'm sorry.
39.2 degrees.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Regardless of fever or God's interference,
Kei-chan...
That's why...
The one that's interfering is you!this sure looks shit in italics
Why are you licking only my nipples?!
Well, then I'll lick this one!
Stop!
Let's do this!alt: Heavy-ho! Bitches, here I come!
I'm off....faggotry
You don't have to see me off.
Riko-nee...
I love... you.
Keita, you idiot.
What's that? It's scary.
Alright!
Well then everyone,
W-Well then, I'll start handing out the question and answer forms.
So there's no problem anymore.
Now all you have to do is take the exam.
You're such a scatterbrain.
That isn't something a high school girl should say...TLC'd
It's okay,
When I think back on it, maybe I was a little strange as well.
I did the best I could.
You're trying to make a fool of me again!
There's a lot of problems, but...
Ako.
So will this look good if I put it here?
Yeah, that's good.
Hey...
Right? Right?!
No, me!
It cleans it all right up!
Sliding, sliding...
We should be okay now.
We did it!
Oh, man! That's bad. How could I forget to put them up?
That's...
You know, keeping you girls worried all the time, clinging onto you two and whatnot.
Let's eat it.
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
Yay!
But this year's...
I can't believe we've finally graduated.
Loosen up a bit, man!C'mon, talk back a bit, will you?
C-Congratulations on graduating.
A-And... about before, well...
Well, you see... after the ceremony, a bunch of juniors came up to me and... y'know.
I'll start.
Amida-kuji, Amida-kuji,
Sen wo tadotte.
So Keita-senpai put your hart and soul into, you hear me. TLC: complete bs againKeita-senpai, take a good look and burn the image into the back of your head, okay?
It's more like she's too clingy.
What are you trying to make Mikuni and... me... do...? TLC: closest match that actually sounds like english I could come up with'd
W-Wouldn't you normally do that with someone your own age?
Don't worry! I don't care if you're a quick shot, Keita-san!
Yeah!
We've found ourselves a powerful rival, but I'm definitely not going to lose!
After all, in the olden days you'd be a fine adult already, Keita.
HMM?!
Keita's "other" graduation ceremony.
Thank you for everything up to now. I'm almost a high school student, huh?
Kei-chan.
Well, we'll just have to take turns, won't we?!
Why?
For us?
A graduation present for us. lit.: memento of his graduation
aogeba toutoshi wa ga shi no on
omoeba ito toshi kono toshitsuki
ima koso wakareme
an9Now is the time of our parting
I wonder if Keita will be happy with this?
It's nothing. It's just... that...
Is that so?
Keita, you liar.
Kei-chan.
Thank you, Ako-neechan, Riko-neechan!
So lucky, our Keita...
Sorry for the intrusion...
Rubbing his pants with his scent and sweat on it...
You're at fault, you were trying to steal a march on me.
Eat your stew!
What "neighborhood association trip"...?
Tomorrow is the parent and child meeting. What should I do about that?
Heavy...
Today is different! I said stop-...
Stop sniffing!
Looks like I'm still on time.
No way...
Why you ask? And why have you come here?
We are... annoying...
That may be fine with you, but not for me!
Really?
No, not really...
How much do you think makes this?
82... No, 83...
I don't want that! There are plenty of things that I want to do with you there!
Hold your horses!
Ouch...
I don't care...
I want to take care of him, too!
So today it's not in your suits.
So, over your whole body...?
On my inner left thigh is ..."Look at".
It means...
Nani nani wo shite ureshii
No, it's not like that!
I can do it, too!
Hehehehe!
Do your studies... With your teacher's body...
Sleeping together!
About ten minutes ago?
Now we have to get prepared for it!
I-I'm sorry about that...
And I thought about not interfering with you.
Girls are candy.
I'll give you a kiss.
Mine is sweeter!
Wait!
Well then, let me give you a kiss as apologize!
No, I will do it!
NO!
Today is a homemade Chinatown-seafood special!
Wow! It looks delicious!
Eat it with your favorite toppings!
But once in a while
Ho, for example?
That should be right in this case, isn't it?
That's no good.
I-It's not like that!
That's not fair! Why is it only him?!
Behold! It's settled!
And...
Come on Senpai, please eat- AH!
W-What is it, Suminoe-san?
Don't hold back, just tell-
But before i knew it... I grew to like it...
And now I...
B-Because I said that kissing is not allowed!
T-Thanks for the food! Thanks for your chocolate!
I have a bad feeling!
I'll do it for you...
Yes...
What?! No way!
Wrong!
He's late.
It can't be helped, that's what puberty is.
Only standing on man's own feet! Just kidding...
You sound like an old hag.
Ako, do you have a brother complex?
Loving... her own little brother?!
No way! The one she is in love with is her-
But how?
Why are such guys so persistent?
I'm remembering some things from the past.
It can't be helped, if it comes out he will hate us.
Ready?
Yeah...
No! I won't let you go home for today!
This is the least we can do for him, right?
It worked...
Well, you know, that is... Look!
Everyday?
Fail! Fail! Fail!
Rather than that, why don't you give it a try, too?
Ehm... I pray that I will pass the exams.
I even threw in my New Year's gift!
So who are you going to marry in the future?
That's rather impossible.
That's not true! It will work if I pray to god!
Originally, this place's god is the god of love.
Anyway, for your love to bear fruit you have to win it.
There are some with our names on them...
Thank you for your serious feelings.
What are you talking about?
What is it?
Kei-chan?
Yes...
Me too!
Those hips! I can't hold it any longer!
Young men's novel
Yes!
Yeah I have!
So if it's a cute girl he wouldn't hold back!
No! No! No!
Huh? Is she going home?
Thank goodness, now I can finally...
Finally away...
You-! You damn-!
You don't have to do it, I'll do it myself so stop!
Ahh... This is all her pee...
Yes...
To pee in front of a classmate although I'm already thirteen...
AHHH! What are you doing?!?
A, B, C...
Gymnastic Storehouse
The sanctuary only adults know of!
"The foreboding Akihabara"
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Please take care of me, Master!
Akibanina huh?
It says it can't display it.
You've tried it before, haven't you?
You got it, Ako? Ero-Games are an important step to adultness!
Have you understood, Riko?
I'll buy an Ero-Game.
We have finally come to Akiba, it would be such a shame not trying it out!
You, be quiet please!
No way...
J-Just now...
Running away is win
THIS IS IT!
A-Anyway, I'll confiscate this!
"Confiscate" you said... And what did you buy just now?
Perfect timing!
K-Kei-chan?!
Right now the problem lies elsewhere!
Love between brother and sister won't have a future!
What I think?
I feel happy I guess...
What should we do?
It's a popular flirting game.
Please shoot me!
Those two are you older sisters!
In this game there's a comic character of my favorite manga artist.
Someone who was about buy it
Educational guidelines...?
Yes, of course! She's really a reliable sister!
That's not the problem!
Bring your pool stuff, right?
They said they'll come.
Your intention to see them in their swimsuits is so obvious.
You should just take the promised article for that...
Ah, here they come.
B-But it's my duty to lead them to the right path!
It's common sense to fill them out with pads.
W-What is it? I'm not wearing pads!
There shouldn't be a problem if I stay by the pool side.
What should I do?!
But this is a rare opportunity to get some information.
What is this... Someone help me...
Good thing he had club activities.
A bit?
And she's worried about us.
Not do I only cause trouble for the sisters, but for their brother as well.
I have to clean this and return it.
It's the smell of sweat... Has it become stronger?
After returning home from work...
The smell is wonderful...
After Uesugi Kenshin's sudden death...
But...
Sensei... This is...
No! Only sniffing!
Huh?
Now I remember!
Slut... Slut...
Doing this and that...
Riko
Yes, before the storm.
Kei-chan will be going with me to the festival!
Wait! Please wait!
Let's go and relax.
Maybe it would have been better to stay at home and learn...
No idea...
Eh?! No thanks, I'm fine!
What is that... Suddenly I...
What are you saying?
What are you talking about, Riko-nee...?
When we were lost and entered the forest...
As if I'm scared now, I'm not a little kid anymore!
Summer, which is filled with the feeling of freedom, is the most dangerous season.
I won't allow it between siblings!
Wait!
Yuuzuki did her best...
TL Note: Lol we even asked a Japanese and this weird TL doesn't sound too off... To be exactly he had no idea as well...
Ahh... Riko-nee...
Am I like the midsummer fairy?
He! Right?
Wait! Ah!
You two look awful!
I can't hold it any longer...
There's no other choice but to do it here...
Impossible...
Aim for Tamahide High School!
I'm telling you, I'll definitely catch one of those tuna!
Dazaifu?
Well then, I'm going to make you some tea.
Oh, thank you!
OK, I'll give it my best! Thank you, Riko-nee!
For a successful exam!
I can't help it! It's so delicious! Your night snacks are the best!
Yay!
Thanks for the food!
Just kidding!
Ako-nee, it was delicious...
Uh? O-Oh well, that's why I said sorry...
But you seem to like it more this way.
Tell me, where is this?
You will see soon.
To use my brother's foot to please myself...
Yeah... Really bad...
I might not be able to become a bride anymore...
What's been happening...this whole time?
Don't say such nonsense!
This is to be expected before exams.
Ako-senpai and Riko-senpai!
Have you come here to pray for passing the exams as well?
Oh, well now that it has become like this I have no other choice but to pray to God!
Oh, I have to go. See ya!
No, I'm not!
Ako, Do you have some?
Ah!
One...
Like I said... what are we-
But, but...
What?
What?
Oh right! Why don't we have Keita pull them out for us?
...pull them out?
I.. I don't want you to..
You really are an idiot.
I'm pulling now, Ako-nee!
Yes, but I'm okay now.
I said stop it, Kei-chan!
No way! I haven't!
As if I could do something embarrassing like that in front of others!
I realize that now...
Well...
Thanks!
It's handmade.
You'll definitely fail!
Thank you... Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
It's attached here, look!
T-r-e-a-t-m-e-n-t!
Yo  Evening
Hiru  NoonLunch
It doesn't matter how hard I worked if I can't take the exams...
Or rather, while I'm standing here quietly, what the heck are you doing to the sick person?
Jeez... You don't love him enough for that!
You two, don't have a quarrel.
Huh?! You're whispering something in his ear!
They're serious...
Kei-chan...
I'll leave everything to you...
I'm revived!
What was that... all of a sudden?
Senpai, fight!
Well then everyone.
To discriminate him is just unreasonable!
Even if it's a long rocky road, I ought to succeed it smoothly.
I understand, Kanetsugu-sama...!
Of course.
It's not there! I forgot my admission ticket!
Hey, are you listening?
Hey!!!
You really are twins in situations like this.
Hey, Ako-san, why are you sleeping in my bed?
Pass your examination safely.
My sisters are by my side.
That's why I will...
I'm home!
I did the best I could.
W-W-Why didn't we open our eyes midway?!
It's a nice day!
Next time: Good day, ejection failure!
I knew you were going to make it.
What is it?
I don't get it, but somehow it feels like I just had a weird dream...
Ah, you are talking about me and Keita's right?
These books are from my relatives who are running a cram school. If you want, you can give them a call.
Adios!
Such... Such things are...
I don't believe this, it must be a lie.
If you keep staying like that, you will fail next year, too.
Snow?
We couldn't read the atmosphere...
We clamored thoughtlessly...
In fact shouldn't I be the one to apologize?
Keita!
Ehh? But...
Cheers!
Ah! Kenta!
Suminoe-kun?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mikuni didn't bring me the letter informing me that I passed,
Oh Mikuni, hello.
Er-Erm about that time, well...
So- sorry! Since it happened so suddenly.
You promised Mikazuki-chan?
Let's start with me.
Err second.
There isn't anything anyone forgot to add in, right?
The one that appears to be the least popular is the collar of his school uniform.
Could it be that...?
It seems that my opinion does not matter, let's do this quick.
Do...?
No, what's with me at a place like this?
Suminoe-kun...
How come they have been ignoring my graduation ceremony? To what extent are these parents irresponsible?
It's frustrating but I have to acknowledge you!
Rather than that mother.
Keita...
What are you doing?
This place is?
How come..?
It smells good.
Riko.
Is that true?
Keita, the octopus boss will get mad.
But this is Japan!
Don't "good morning" me.
Will you be okay having only that yogurt drink?
Oh, that's right! I heard about what happened the other day.
Even though you're my brother, I love you, Kei-chan!
Oh honey.
Kurata-san across the street was so excited that something finally happened.
I'm leaving!
You're forgetting your goodbye kiss.
Keita. Why are you all worn out this early in the morning?
Quit it with the weird fantasies, you idiots!
Why are you two in my room?
In other words, we're asking if you want to do it.
I sent you some vibes.
What are you doing, Ako!?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it. It'll just take four or five days instead of two or three now.
Kei-chan, just let me know if you need help with anything. I'll do whatever you want.
Sign: Bath
How am I going to wash my body?I think I know
It's not like I can have my sisters come in and wash me.Yes you can
Speaking of which, I've been okay with my sisters kissing me recently...
Wait a minute! Being okay with it is a huge problem!
Enough about me. What's that, Ako?bleh
I don't mind. We're siblings.
Peek-a-boo.
Therefore, I am going to leave right now!
Turtle?
Red sea turtle, blue sea turtle, yellow sea turtle?
Hey, put some clothes on before you do anything!
If I stimulate him like this, Keita will definitely wake up.
I need to recover as soon as possible.
Wait!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it...
Don't let that sparkle fade until the day we meet again
Hold your memories close and step forward
Looking up at your constellation I envision that smile
Don't let that sparkle fade until the day we meet again
be1And we'll split our love for him evenly
Ohhh... Stop...
so I joined him.
seijou da, ureshii yo
We're siblings, you know!
With a stepbrother and his stepsisters, it's just like any other man and woman.
You're forgetting your goodbye kiss.
And it'd even be perfectly acceptable for you to engage in forbidden love!
Let us in, we'll be quiet.
But if we're already inside...
Why? We'll be quiet.
Okay!
And there you have it.
I can't help it... Exams are coming up.
Geez, Riko, stop twisting everything around.
You don't need to worry about it!
Me too.
I'm fine. I'll manage with one hand.
Sign: Bath
Bath?
It's not like I can have my sisters come in and wash me.
But, but... you're naked!
So I came to take care of you.
It sounds kind of dirty when you say it.
Huh, what?
Shit, my hand... I must have twisted it again.
Morning already?
Huh? Since when was I in my room?
Oh, another letter?

Hold your memories close and step forward
Looking up at your constellation I envision that smile
Shine, my heart, until we meet again
We can come back and relax again tonight.
Hey, where should we go next?
Even though it's fake, this is...
Oh wow, this is amazing!
They're only pictures; they're not even real!
Oh, Ako...
Without a doubt,
A family bath?
We're a family, so it's okay.
You can come in now.
Yeah, right.
What's wrong, Kei-chan?
O-Oh, thank you.
My body is suddenly getting hot and...
You'll be boiled alive if you sleep in the bath, Riko-nee.
Fully naked, fully open!
Nooooo!
Kei-chan...
Wait a second.
A never ending spring of life that flows out...
Hey, Kei-chan?
The night air is refreshing.
Huh?
How is it?
It's been quite a while since we've been like this.
Your breasts!
Hey, because you were moving around so much, my Yukata came off.
how you're rolling it with the tip of your tongue!
I didn't imagine it would be this sensational.
You're sucking too much!
really disappointing.
I must have done something weird.

be1Ako, are you awake?
be1Come help me out a little.
be1Okay.
be1Recover quickly and come downstairs!
be1Oh, wow! You're so popular, Keita!
be1And you said studies, but...
be1I've decided on my high school based on a sports recommendation.
be1What the heck are my sisters thinking?!
be1Keita.
be1How dangerous!
be1Oh, really.
be1Bad boy!
be1Only you...
be1What are you doing, Riko?
be1Hey... in what kind of world do people enjoy looking at their sister's panties?
be1Oh, what's Keita doing over there?
be1Why are you getting all red and trying to let it pass?
be1My pants...
be1By the way, where's Kei-chan?
be1Just when I was going to give you a boxed lunch for school...
be1You were eating it yourself up until last year!
be1It's fine, since you're a boy in puberty!
be1It's just because I didn't have breakfast and...
be1It's a lunch from the convenience store and...
be1Yeah, it's absolutely fine.
be1Stop it, Ako-neechan! It's embarrassing!
be1I love you so much!
be1Kei-chan, I'm not doing this because you're my brother...
be1Ako-neechan, Riko-neechan!
be1I'm sorry...
be1Since you're going to a school far away starting from next year.
be1Well...
be1That's why we felt so lonely...
be1For being a naughty sister.
be1But, if I disregard the recommendation that they gave me...
be1Woohoo!
be1What?
be1You mustn't do that kind of stuff to Kei-chan!
It's already morning.
I've got to hurry or I'll be late for school.
Oh yeah, Kei-chan! You can't move, right?
Later, Kei-chan.
I will too...
Now...
What are you doing next?
Don't do it anymore.
The cool eyed, magnificent, and elegant discipline committee president.
What are you doing, Riko?
Hey... in what kind of world do people enjoy looking at their sister's panties?
Kei-chan...
Geez... In the end, the only reason they do that is so that they won't lose to the other one...
It's your fault for attempting a sneak attack...
Because I felt like it...
Hey!
What are you doing, sisters!?
You're up early today, Keita.
Kei-chan...
Oh, you're early Keita.
Geez, Kei-chan...
Here you go!
It's just because I didn't have breakfast and...
Y-You guys!
Do you think I'll believe a story like that?
So nobody should give a damn if I want to fuck them like crazy!
Well...
You won't be lonely if we stay together...
He must have hit his head.
Hey! I want to rub on Kei-chan's thing too!
Stop your sneak attacks!
Hey, what are you thinking?! Urgent Announcement!!
So then, Urgent Announcement!!
Kei-chanfnArial
Oh, good morning.
No, well, I came to wake Keita up too, but...
Well... as I was watching Keita's seemingly happy, sleeping face,
But...
If you're not blood related, then you're nothing but a man and a woman.
Oh Mommy...
Geez. I'm leaving!
Oh hey.
My, my.
Were you up all night studying?
Be honest!
What were you doing all night with your sisters?!
Don't get any wrong ideas!
You've thought about it too, haven't you?
See?
You do, right?
They told me it should heal within a few days if I rest it and keep it wrapped up.
I just happend to punch my desk...
Thank you...
Oh? Yes...
Keita, me too.
Oh then I will be going off to take a bath.
Ouch...
It seems impossible.
I sometimes see them as girls, now!
Since it hurts, I should hurry up and wash myself and get out.
Don't worry about it.
You might want to sport a bit of common sensefscx200-
Is it my fault?
Don't fool around!
I did self-censor my self by avoiding terms like 'threesome'est: she uses term 'nirinsha' two-wheel-vehicle which means tho girls giving a man sexual service
I mustn't get aroused by my sisters!
Oh no!
K-Keichan?
Kei-chan?
Hey, before you do that, put something on, first!
Ouch...
Because of self-hate, I can't face you in person so I will leave this letter.
Oh well, it can't be helped.
It looks like you have a fracture.
It'll take 3 weeks for it to completely heal.
You should be happy.
We're getting ready for entrance exams you know...
You can tell me that, but...
Excuse me...
Oh I'm fine just listening to you two sing.
Geez, you're so gloomy.
Huh?
S-Seriously?
Thanks to that...
My legs won't work.
This isn't the time to say that!
I haven't peed my pants since preschool.
Huh?
Are we ready now?
I'm taking them off now.
Okay, I'll just be outside.
Behind me... right now Riko-nee is...
How perverted.
Why are you bringing that up, now? Text: Crying
I...
Huh?
Y-You got it wrong!
Sign: Karaoke Dynasty
I'm not.
She looks so happy...
I believe you, so...
Will you share some of your cheerfulness with me?
Put your tongue out.
And because of that, I haven't had any skin-ship time with him lately!
Wh-What about you, Riko?!
At this rate we'll shrivel up as women!
Kei-chan!
He's been studying by himself the entire time.
Let's see...
Well...
Any healthy middle-schooler should have at least one!
No, no, no!
So? Have you peeked at it?
I can't believe he bought this!
It's a porno about a guy who has sex with his sisters.
I want to look at it, too!
These perverted things are immoral!i don't approve of this ecchi shit, guys
Wait!
"Yet"?
He wouldn't!
I'd rather do this than to have the two of us be separated from him.
but maybe red would be better.
I'm a little hurt by that...
S-Sorry, Ako.
I'll be going on ahead.
Dummy!
Wh-What's with that pleasant moan?
Your hips are taking a break.
Come on!
I said stop!
I never would've imagined that Keita's smell and this stimulation would feel so good!
Riko... Hurry!
C-Come closer!
Keita!
I won't stop.
you don't seem to be satisfied either, Ako.
I can't stop...
Right. That was only practice...yeah, yeah.... RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT.
I'll be back late, so I won't need dinner.
Now, let's do the usual.
That's what you think!
Meanwhile, I'll...
It's cold...
Now come over here and lay on your stomach.
You're right.
As per the master, "To like is better than to know."
O-Oh, really?! What do you listen to?
Where? Where?
I was so close to trying out new spots. semi-bs'ed
Yeah, it's okay.
Hey...
He's gone. could be interpreted as "I came"
I can't study like this.
Good night.
What was that all about?
A kiss.
Oh, just a kiss.
Oh crap, I'm losing it again. However, Ako-nee's tongue really feels good.
What a pity, you guys got found out before you could leave any hickeys.
Hauu....
Well, I do this all the time.
But I can't fall asleep feeling like this, either!
Normally, if you heard their voices, you'd be disgusted and wouldn't want to do it at all, right?
Yeah
Wherever.
Get out!
So, what?
This is interesting, I like Riko-nee's reaction.
A-Amazing! It's like there are hundreds of hands touching me. lol i have no idea something along that line I think
What am I doing?
I'm Suminoe Riko.
9th volume limited edition of the kiss x sis manga.
But if I do that, will you two not be with me anymore?
Huh?
Always. Forever.
Ako-nee... Riko-nee...
If you're lying, you're dead! it's on?we can't just leave this alone?
No!
Give me that!
Why don't you go caress the one that smells like detergent?
Eat my stew.
Kei-chan. She looks better with her bangs down
Wait! How did you get in?!
Why not? This is just a greeting.
Don't worry... It's okay!
It was just a dream...
Oh well, next time...
Don't sniff it!
Sensei.
I have a headache, so I'll be leaving early.
Idiot, I'm telling you it was a dream.
Ako-sempai!
I'll take you where you need to go, Riko-sempai!
Maybe there's some truth to those rumors.
Hey, wait right there.
Please listen to this song I wrote.
Would you stop already, Ako-nee, Riko-nee?
Thank goodness.
Th-That was... But...
If you two come here, it only causes me trouble!
Ako-nee and Riko-nee, you're my sisters.
No, but...
Are you planning on rejecting their feelings?!
Kei-chan finally started cramming to get into Tamakiri High School!
Huh?
Keita, why are you not getting enough sleep?!
Wonderful days
Shut up!
I'm glad they still like me, but...
Geez! Forget about that and stir the stew so it won't burn, okay?!
Wait! Where did you get that from?!
Ah... My stew!
Well, drink up, although it's only cola.
Ah... Um... It's nothing.
We're siblings! We can't do this!
Good job today! eff not having a tl for otsukare...
Oh, it's okay, it's okay. I don't care about the other club members. tlcit's fine - 1569
After school, huh...ZOMG HE'S NOT GAY!!!!!!!!
Okay...
Nothing will get accomplished by just by sitting here. Might as well go.
I'll take you where you need to go, Riko-sempai!
Huh?!
What the hell?!
Ah Kei-chan!
Ugh, you're annoying!
Oh, it's just those two siblings again.
If you two come here, it only causes me trouble!
I don't care if it's okay with you, it's not okay with me.
Looks like we did something needless.
That Ako-nee and Riko-nee came here for...
Um... I'm sorry.
Don't do this in front of everyone?
Don't say something so stupid.I love this dad lol
Eh?
Oh my! Or will it be Riko?hell... why not both!

Keita, you're still a child.
But still, there are lots of dreams yet to be fulfilled.
It suits you Ako-nyan.
Can't wait. Can't wait. Can't wait.R: So I guess you don't like literal translation, huh?
What is this?
So you tried that too.
Is it too advanced?
Piss fetish.
I couldn't win at all against the fourth stage boss.
But you want the real thing, right?
What is it?
And where is Riko-nee?
Are you girls planning something?R: dunno about using "guys" when talking to a group of girls... I just had that word .;
It's for memories. Memories at Akiba.
Welcome.
What kind of outfit is that?
You don't have to point it out.
How annoying.
Hey, quiet down!
Oh, sorr--
How about you?R: non of your business, brat.
Ah, don't worry about it. I'll go and look for her. So wait!
But before, you happily bought it.
Sensei, are you possible an otaku?
Thinking back, there was a rumor about Ako-san liking her little brother.
What are you three thinking about?
This kind of abnormal unhappiness would happen.
Keita and us aren't connected by blood.
What should we do?
But Kei-chan is...
You're quick to jump to conclusions.
Excuse me.
Sexual play?
Take my triple shot gun!
The most popular one is Naoe Kanetsugu-sama armor.
They're not anywhere.
Oh brother, your castle is going to fall.
Worst thing?
You bought the game for me.

Sorry.

Well, well, just look here.
Wait up.
Ako-sempai! Riko-sempai!
Keita-sempai, me too!

I could spend this money on so many cups of Instant Ramen at the 100 yen store...
Wow! Amazing!
Who cares. I don't need a swimsuit.
What is it?
Hmm, somebody's in there already.
One more time!
Okay, Ako.
Wh-What do you mean? As your teacher, I'm just trying to prevent you from going down the wrong path.
Hey! I got it!
Um, I only have this, but if it's okay with you...
Roll, roll, roll... Taking off the wet stockings...
Don't worry about it. You can just return it like it is.
Keita-kun was really embarrassed.
I should be used to this from school...
I can't... stop!

Hey, hey, tonight is the summer festival!
I'm in trouble.
And I really want the limited Kanetsugu-sama figure which gets released tomorrow.
Damn it.
Ah, Kei-chan? What is it?
Toda said there's absolutely no other choice.
That's suspicious...
If I take one step forward, I can meet my admired Kanetsugu-sama in an air conditioned place.
But I'm a teacher, a model for students.
Does it suit me?
Ako-nee... Riko-nee... They look amazing on you.
Geez, sempai! Look at mine, too!
I know, right?!
You two going flower picking?
I'm tired.
I got so excited because I haven't been able to go out with Kei-chan in a while.
Are you alive?
Take this, pervert!
This is okay, right?
Kei-chan, don't look!
Is that really okay?
It's smells like sweat.
It must be hard on Mikazuki-chan, having that weird teacher for a sister.
After all, I'm naked...
Naked?
I'll just wash it in five minutes.
This smell is amazing...
My naked skin against this jersey... It's so good!
Aren't you naughty.
Sensei.
The line that I couldn't cross with my sisters...
I'm going to cum!
Yo, what the hell are you doing just laying aro-
That's right!
I can't return it like this!
You're misunderstanding us, Sensei!
So hard...
The pool?
Toda is with him too?
Yes, yes. It's just as I expected. They sure do love you.
I've got the promised goods.
Even more, if all goes well, I could be financially sound.
They're...
Ah! Kei-chan!
They can't!
Kei-chan.
Does it suit me?
The pretty mannequin was wearing it and posed like this.
That top is fascinating!
Wow! Amazing!
What am I supposed to do, Kanetsugu-sama?
Hmm, somebody's in there already.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee, what happened?
Even if it's not okay, nobody brought an extra change of clothes.
if you get into Tamahide,
Does the scent of sweat gets more smelly?
However, it doesn't really feel bad...
If I keep doing this...
For your punishment,
My breasts are pretty big, right?
I can't.
Huh? Why am I wearing a jersey?
Slut...slut...
I hide it from my real friends
Both of us are here
It turned into true love before I knew it
How's this? Does it feel good?
Well, it's not like I found it.
Okay...
How nice.
This is a test taker's day to relax.
Don't ask for the impossible.
Fear and pain is just the beginning.
It's way too crowded.
I should go back.
an8No, it's this way!
S-Suminoe-kun!
Kei-chan!
It's fine. We'll meet up with her eventually.
Riko also wants you to have a pleasant time.
Why am I getting so nervous?
Eh?
Are you alright, Nee-chan?
What do you mean by still?
We went to a summer festival when we were young.
Then we can go a bit further, right?
You're not scared... right?
Let's go.
A summer with an air of freedom is the most dangerous season.
This is a battle to climb the steps of adulthood during the mid-summer night.
As a teacher, as an adult, and yes, as a human!
Oh crap. Run, Keita.
For the students' sake, I have to put my life on the line.
The heavens must have bestowed upon me a chain of misfortune.
Kiriyu Yuzuki, go.
Ako, what's with that look? You're all sticky.
But why were we laughing?
When you let out a loud voice, you feel refreshed.
blur4I spoke to him once
blur4Our eyes met three times
blur4Could it be... Wait!
blur4
Eh? A charm that works well for exams?
I learned this from a book.
Well, it's not like I found it.
It's already that time?
They've calmed down, yet there's tension in the air.
Oh... I see.
We have a plan.
It'll start to feel good, soon.
It's nothing.
But a festival has to be like this.
They asked me to come,
I am not! Look, this way is better, right?
Kei-chan!
Yeah, just relax. Relax.
Kei-chan, you wanted to eat the same thing as me.
Ako-nee!
What is this?
We got lost, and while we were inside the forest,
Then we can go a bit further, right?
Good.
Ms. Mikoshi?
Kei-chan...
Ako, what's with that look? You're all sticky.
How are the special summer courses at prep school?
Alright, turn over.
The students say summer is a challenge.
We're close together and it's night time...
An unforgettable summer memory.
This is a test taker's day to relax.
Let's go. Off to relax, off to relax.
A quiet place is more suitable for relaxation.
This way is much better!
No, it's this way!
Kei-chan!
Why?
Riko also wants you to have a pleasant time.
Looks good.
Eh?
This time it's this way.
We went to a summer festival when we were young.
We got lost, and while we were inside the forest,
It's a festival.
No way...
How is it? Is it sexy? Is it bewitching?
Am I a mid-summer fairy?
Kei-chan...
Ako, what's with that look? You're all sticky.
Jeez, what a summer festival...
Pee...
Keita?
Crying or laughing, it all depends on how I do this winter.
If we can't find an answer in reality,
Our futures will always be connected
I want you to look only at me
I can't be bothered by onlookers, so I've got to study.
Although it's somewhat clich, it's the usual superstitious stuff.
Ow, ow!
It's your fault.
But I still remember the feeling of your hand when you touched it.
Riko-nee, what are you doing with my foot?
Or rather, I can't.
What's been happening this whole time?
Where did they come from?
I'm not!
Being able to count all of them...
It can't be.
I was just messing around with you because we're twins.
But... but...!
Kei-chan, I'm embarrassed.
Welcome back.
Did you pull one out?
I apologize to all those men.
Ako, you should just go to sleep now.
It's too late.
Listen, what's inside is a secret between us two, okay?
Huh?
Thank you.
If you open it, you'll fail.
Kei-chan, where's the charm?
A place that stands out...
blur4Teddy boy, our precious steady boy
blur4I will love you forever
blur4
blur4This love war
What an unreliable guy.
It's not like God is going to listen to every single one of them.
I'm glad.
It's for a successful exam.
Let's eat!
But it's really good.
Are you okay, Riko-nee?
You can't do that.
Tell me, where is this?
It's nice, Keita. It's so great.
Your foot is pretty big.
I might like your foot better than your hand.
It's your fault. It's not like I can't stare.
To get off on my little brother's foot...
Kei-chan, sorry for making you wait.
Keita, you're sweating all over.
I'm think I'm going to
You're not going to eat any apples?
I am, I am!
Where did they come from?
With this small amount, will the charm still work?
Right?
Then I'll leave the charm bag to you.
Oh yeah, since there's an opportunity, why don't we ask Keita to pull them out?
If we're going to make one, we should hurry.
Or did you want the option of putting one in with pee on it?
Keita.
I thought all the men that didn't have a lot of hair and were trying to evenly style it looked uncool.
I now know that every single one matters.
Ako, you should just go to sleep now.
Inside here, you and I are entwined together.
Where is this from?
What?
I want you to think of it as us and treat is as such, but...
If you open it, you'll fail.
I'm off.
Kei-chan, where's the charm?
If it's like this, I can show this to everyone.
Give you a kiss.
I think I understand.
There's a lot of things I want to do with you in high school!
You used your Striker Sigma V.
Yes!
All right, I'll do it!
Damn! I can't lose focus like that!
Don't worry, he has me teaching him!
Ako, you've always had excellent grades.
Wait! I'm dumb because of you?!
Even if you say that, you're not able to help him study.
The triangle's inner angle is 180 so the second triangle is...
All right! Change of plans!
Meaning?
My right thigh says...
Sorry.
To look at, "look at".
Studying is the most important thing right now.
Today, we're studying history. I wish I had a tutor like this.
You don't normally get good grades like that.
It's just... Ako-nee has been tutoring me.
Hey, what kind of private lessons are you doing?!
She's probably teaching you things that aren't school related right?!
Let me see.
Rubbing... Rubbing...
We really don't have to do a test at home...
cH1914CDchink!
1573.
How about the Kamakura shogunate's downfall?!
1333.
Tick... Tock...
It kind of makes my heart race.
Kei-chan, you can't! Wow, he got pretty far with his sister...ew....
This is a punishment game, after all.
That's why I told you to leave Kei-chan to me.
It's all thanks to you, Ako-nee.
Thank you.
Good for you, Kei-chan.
Dad's gonna catch the king of all tuna one of these days.
How are your studies coming along?
It's coming along here and there.
You're giving it your all, aren't you Kei-chan?
I'm on the final stretch now.
A headband?
I guess this is needed for a graduating student.
Kei-chan, it's time for your late night supper.
It tastes great!
That's a relief.
It was really good.
What are you doing, Riko-nee?
Your height.
Say it clearly.
We've shown each other our naked bodies in the bath.
Soaked?
No, don't stare at me like that.
It's your fault. It's not like I can't stare.
Doing this!
Sorry, was that too strong?
You don't want to?
What are you two doing?!
Did you come to pray that you'd pass?
I'm surprised you got so many.
Oh, there's something that looks useful.
Cleverly saying...
Ah, how refreshing.
They're so loud.
Now that I've calmed down, that leaves the other problem.
With this small amount, will the charm still work?
Come on, spread your legs.
No.
It's okay, Kei-chan.
No!
Oh... That hurt.
Wait.
You just came out from the bath.
And now the inside is complete.
There's a warning that comes with this charm.
That can't be!
Is this what they call youthful indiscretion?
is to be taken care of!
My imagination and my delusions are going out of control!
Endless happiness
but they still found out
Daytime
39.2C.
I never thought I'd be disqualified due to absence.
you've been studying from dawn till dusk, haven't you?
Kei-chan.
They say that if you pass on a cold, you'll heal faster.
That's why I was trying to take Kei-chan's cold.
Riko, you think that's just superstition, don't you?
After the exam, I'll let you release it inside of me.
You're going to keep this up even though I'm covered in sweat?
No.
They're honestly trying to cure me.
Keita.
It's warm.
All right!
If it's you, Keita, then you'll be fine.
Do your best.
Ifscx200-r?
What just happened?
Oh, no! My fever is getting higher!
Keita, you idiot!
Keita-senpai.
You really were nursed by them!
What am I thinking?
Charge!
I'll do my best, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Of course.
Hey, are you listening to me?
What am I going to do?
You're so careless.
Besides, sleeping alone is lonely.
I'm sure of it.
I was calm and I finished at the end.
I'm back.
They're pretty cute when they're sleeping.
blur4Strange that we both love the same guy
blur4Hey! He's here!
His exams are the day after tomorrow!
Sorry.
Let's just nurse him back to health.
I licked up Keita's sweat for him.
Then I'll do it, too.
After the exam, I'll let you release it inside of me.
I was just licking his ear.
Hey!
If you don't make careless mistakes, you'll pass.
Even if I have to put my professional life on the line,
I'll be handing out the answer sheet and the questionnaires now.
You're talking about that, right?
It's okay, just calm down.
Ako, you're so helpless.
Don't worry about it.
I was calm and I finished at the end.
I'm sure that I passed.
Suminoe-kun also took the test here?
When I think again, wasn't I a little strange?
What can I say?
Let's just nurse him back to health.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I never thought I'd be disqualified due to absence.
What are you saying?
I'm sorry for not being able to attend the same high school as you two.
you've been studying from dawn till dusk, haven't you?
It hurts...
Keita, you're sweating.
It's like how a cat licks her kittens in order to clean them.
Idiots, why are you licking my nipples?
There's something hard down here.
I was just licking his ear.
Just stay still.
Leave everything to me.
Do your best.
Keita, you idiot!
All right.
he is still a test-taking student.
Isn't that right, Kanetsugu-sama?
Charge!
If you go back to get it, there should still be time to spare.
What should I do? What should I do?
Hey, are you listening to me?
You left it on your desk.
Keita.
By the way, Ako-san, why are you sleeping in my bed?
Before we knew it, he's become so reliable.
Keita.
Suminoe-kun also took the test here?
No! Don't cry, Riko!
He tried so hard.
Oh my, Keita is my child.
Since both of us love you,
shouldn't we look for it in our dreams?
Let your curiosity run wild!
Our love is better doubled than halved
Yeah, it should be.
It is yours, but...
This is today's lucky item.
Hurray! Hurray!
It has.
Go and have a look.
Now we're in the same high school, Ako-senpai!
Hey, what do you want to do on the graduation trip?
Eh? About what?
Don't mind it! Don't mind it!
Where did you go?
So we secretly...
Yes.
Where did you run off to?
Um... Suminoe-kun?
A letter of acceptance will be mailed to those who passed the exam, and those who made it into the open spots.
Thank you, Mikuni.
You're going to catch a cold.
Kei-chan...
Got accepted!
But kissing and hugging is prohibited at high school, okay?
blur4Let me be beside you more than anyone else
blur4Strange that we both love the same guy
blur4Hey! He's here!
blur4I want to do something about him
Before that, Riko, Kei-chan, and I
What?
It looks kind of plain.
Ako, how's the cooking going?
My happy, lucky, wonderful school life depends on this announcement.
No, he's with me.
That scarf isn't the one you usually wear.
So this isn't for me?
That's why you'll definitely pass.
He tried so hard,
It's not true. It's not true.
It's not like you understand how we feel!
Eh? About what?
Keita-senpai!
Please do something about her.
Huh? Where's Kei-chan? Huh? Where's Keita?
Kenta!
So we secretly...
Yes?
Kenta is my dog at home.
Kenta!
This is--
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
Got accepted!
Congratulations, Keita.
Once again, it's the three of us.
Next time: One, Two, 3P.
Congratulations!
As expected of my son.
My happiness is also your happiness.
That's why you'll definitely pass.
Now we're in the same high school, Ako-senpai!
How about skiing, Ako-senpai?
He tried so hard,
You're great! You're great, Keita-senpai!
Huh? Where's Kei-chan? NHuh? Where's Keita?
Right, Kanetsugu-sama?
Where did you go?
One that I would go to the same high school as you two.
Keita.NKei-chan.
It's a little...
Kenta!
As soon as I found it, it was already like this.
I was so surprised.
Well, I'm really sorry!
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
Congratulations, Keita.
If we can't find an answer in reality,
It's a secret, but what I really want is...
Kiss me
Man, it's finally over!
Hey.
Next time I see her, I have to thank her.
Congratulations on graduating.
That incident? You mean...
Hmm, what are we flirting about?
Ah! Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
Hey!
Ah, all the buttons are gone!
How could you, Keita-senpai?!
You promised Mikazuki-chan?!
Ako-senpai. Riko-senpai.
I'll start off. Number one.
Follow the line.
What is this? What kind of people are they?
She has more common sense than Ako-senpai when it comes to this.
Saving the best for last, huh?
Stop it.
A sound argument.
This was...
Of course we haven't; we're siblings.
Well then, Mikuni.
Look out!
Another powerful rival has appeared, but I definitely will not lose.
We'll do it together.
Why?
I can't choose between you two.
Our graduation memento.
This is a new year, so I'll wear this and do my best.
Suminoe-kun.
Riko.
Whenever Kei-chan...
Thank you, middle school life.
We finally graduated!
What are you saying? At least make a quip back.
If Mikuni hadn't delivered that letter of acceptance to me,
who knows what would have happened?
Hi.
Um, that incident was...
How so?
Why are you here?
We obviously came here for your button.
Write down what you want.
Then why are you here?
I just went with the flow.
Next is for Keita-senpai to flip your skirt?
This is the one I wrote for myself.
Jeez, she did it so shamelessly.
Well, let's get back to it.
Go ahead.
Sorry, but I'll pass.
If I remember correctly...
Are you trying to do something, Suminoe-kun?
People usually do this with classmates, right?
I'm glad.
Time is up!
No, but... this is...
Right?
So why didn't they come to my graduation ceremony?
Whenever you decide, let me know.
I don't want any of us to be jealous, so this is the only way.
No.
Just that one!
I'm sorry, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
For our sake.
chooses one of us.
It can't be avoided.
Thank you, middle school life.
We finally graduated!
What are you saying? At least make a quip back.
That incident? You mean...
Ah, all the buttons are gone!
How could you, Keita-senpai?!
Damn you, Keita!
What now?
We came all the way here. To leave empty-handed is...
Ako-senpai. Riko-senpai.
You're annoying!
It's a splendid backup plan for the poor lambs
My opinion hasn't been noted.
Okay, we're going to start.
The one without much appeal would be the school uniform collar.
Keita-senpai, make sure you take a good look and engrave it into your mind.
We've done it so much that he should be immune to it.
But at this point you can't seduce someone with just your underwear.
In front of everyone?
Okay! Don't hold back, and go ahead!
Saving the best for last, huh?
do...
Really, time flies like an arrow, and now he's already graduated.
Seriously...
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
Kei-chan.
Keita.
Stop! Where are you planning to take me?
Keita-senpai!
Keita senpai, I'll take your second button!
I'll save this one at the very least.
That's for my sisters.
Kei-chan.
What a lovely scent.
For our spoiled Kei-chan.
It's nothing.
But I just couldn't concentrate on studying.
Don't worry! Starting today, I'll do my best to help you study!
Yes!
You can't right now.
Right now, you have to concentrate on studying.
All right, I'll do it!
That's not what she meant.
What kind of parents do I have?
"be interested in"!
What an animal. need better words
Keita's pretty daring this early in the morning.
bH I G H ! T A M A K I R I G O F O R I T !
Even I can...
Rubbing... Rubbing... Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
No, no. Right now, I'm your teacher.
Study your teacher's body well.
Ako-nee is genuinely helping me study...
When I came to help you study, you were already asleep.
So instead of waking me up, you thought you'd have fun sleeping with me.
Okay, so today, we're going to have a test.
I didn't mean it like...
Tick... Tock...
This is a punishment game, after all.
You know Riko-nee, this was a punishment game!
What is this?
Oh well...
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
Good for you, Kei-chan.
Sugar, spice, and a special hidden flavor. Alluring Sweets !
Even if something else happens,

You're so lucky, Keita,
We're siblings.
I'm back.

look at mine, too...
Bigger by two centimetres.
Even though them liking me makes me really happy.
Hey! What are you doing?
Kei-chan should be getting out of the bath soon. he appears to be bathinglit:should be getting out soon-N
It's because I trusted a certain someone too much!
Oh well, drink up first.
Weird Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
It's already become like this.
L-Lies!
Let's go to school, too...
Keita-senpai!
You've worked hard.
The parent-teacher conference will be important.
For our high school dream to come true...
You're just dreaming.
Let me lead the way, Riko-senpai.
No! Kei-chan!!Dunno, doesn't she say "Nooo, Kei-chan!"? -masatYes she does. Masat TL from now on-N
What's going on outside?
Ouch. Hey, bro. There's only ONE Hino Akiharu
I don't think so at all!
Ako-nee and Riko-nee came for this?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Only AkoRiko-senpai.
This makes them even greater girls.Changed girl to plural, assuming he's talking about both of them
Kei-chan will always be...
Next time, a lesson from the two of us.Same as sign above... so pick what you want to do with it-N
I'll give you a kiss!
Nothing.
Eh?
I suppose...
Don't worry!
I know that, but...
Right now you have to focus and study.
That's the spirit! Kei-chan.
Damn it, I won't lose.
Oh yeah, Kei-chan, what do you want for a midnight snack?
Though, you can't borrow your mum.under grammar laws you do not capitalize mom
I want to take care of Keita too.
I can still take care of my little brother.
I don't know what to say to them.
No... I still remembered but...
If I do it like this, you won't forget what I teach you.
"At... last."
Today's lesson is History.
In the year 794, the peace in....
If it's for Keita...
Strawberry panties?!
Y-Yeah...
AhDoes this line really need a sub? She is moaning.-milky
Forget about that. Study, study!enough of this?And random caps in middle of lines
Eh?
Then I'll reward you if you answer it right!
Ako-nee!added this -masat
What year was the Tokugawa Shogunate defeated?added 'the'. These shogunates are not 'one' person but a regiment, more like a group, so using 'the' is necessary.-milky
What year was the Muromachi Shogunate defeated?
This is the punishment of the punishment game.
Something like this...
I-Idiot! Why am I getting nervous too?
Don't make me wait too long... Kei-chan.
Because it's a punishment game...
Please... Hurry...
W-Wait.
But if it's a place that can't be seen... then it's fine.
Oh well.
Sorry!
I made it! My grade went up, look!grade or grades?
Isn't this great? Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.
You're the one who interrupted me!
That's not what happened.
You should be reflecting on what you did.
No more kissing!
Woah, it looks delicious!
Green onion, fried sweet dough, preserved pickles.
Absolutely not.
Keita, you've been getting midnight snacks from Ako-nee, right?
I already knew... it would turn out like this.
When we look at it...
Sweet, sweet, sweet.
Amazing, Riko-nee.
B-But.
I'll take one more...
Yes.
What are girls made of?
You two...!
Right, Riko-nee?
Riko-nee...
Next time, qualifications of a lover.
Um?
They've improved in every way!
Shock!Gaoo means shock?Gan
I'm going to change.
D-Do you want me... to help?
We're finally going to a different school from Kei-chan, huh?
Yeah... even if that's true.
But how do I do that?
But Keita's so lonely...
Don't say that... just try to date someone else.
As if! This is so irritating!
Me?!
Sticking to your brother complex won't do you any good.She says brother-con again, so make sure "brother complex" doesn't get edited out.
My hopes are destroyed. Guys are way too dirty.
Here he comes.
It's at times like these when I hate that we're twins...
You should do some activities too.
Hey, don't pull me.
Kiss
This is as much as we can do, huh?
But, Ako has been coming here for a long time.
So? Which one of your sisters do you want to marry?
For love to come to fruition, you must earn affection.After you've been in love, you'll receive love.This is an odd maxim-type line that doesn't translate well in condensed form. Best I can do with it.
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong? Keita.
Purposely distancing myself from my sisters...
I'll get into a relationship with him.
You don't have to clap so hard...
Ako...
But!
What? That's kinda creepy.could also be unpleasant
Suminoe-kun is... My...
I'm for curves...
Huh?! You actually think that way?
I'm home.
Welcome home.
You're annoying me.
Oh my, what a youthful scene.
Damn it!
What the hell am I thinking!
So she's actually the librarian.
being overly friendly to a high school girl.
No!
He's looking... He's looking over here.
I can't... I can't hold it anymore!
This is...?
Thank goodness, now I can finally relax...
Suddenly...!
Kei-chan, where are you?
They should lock up properly.
Come on, hurry up.
Please...
Found him!
Uncensored?
Cute.
It says it can't be displayed?
It's a filter!
Sorry...
Ehh? A photo?!
Geez. I'll help you.
Pipe down already! Manners have been declining in Akiba lately.
Ah... Yes...split -masat
You're misunderstanding, this is about...split -masat
I'm buying that!
Where did Riko-nee disappear to?
S-Suminoe Ako-san?
Now that you mention it, back at the cosplay store...
an7The lewd twins opening up to their younger brother. Golden shower time until the morning!
Kei-chan?
We just love Keita!
First come first serve!
It's a popular flirting game.split, please check time - Nanakotoadjusted -masat
Anyway, let's keep looking.
What are you guys doing?!
What were you thinking, Sensei?
But I'm under 18, so I can't go and buy it.
But I really, really wanted it, and when I was agonizing over it, my sister said she would buy it for me.
What a kind sister I have!
That's great, that's great, Onee-chan!
Don't worry, don't worry. I'll hide your face.
Keep it together, Yuzuki!
But, but, a little is fine, just once more, just five minutes!
And sales of the limited edition Kanetsugu-sama figurine start tomorrow.
What should I do?
Thanks for coming during summer break, even though you're busy studying for your exams.
You're tickling me!
What the hell are you guys doing?
What should I do?
Keita!
How does it look?
I thought this would cheer you up, so I bought it.
You don't have to stare at them so much.
Well, since we came all the way to the pool, let's take a swim together.
Sorry, just wait here.
It's been so long since we went out with Kei-chan. I think I overdid it.
Too bad there were so many unwanted obstacles.
What kind of relationship does she have with Keita?
Maybe a peeping tom?
Stop it!
More importantly, you'll catch a cold if you don't change out of those clothes, Onee-chan.
Yeah, thanks.
Wh-What are you doing!? Changing here in front of the guys!?
It probably smells pretty bad.
Keita will be happy that it still has the scent of an older woman.
What's with this strange feeling of freedom?
You can't! You can only smell.
There's no turning back now.
After all, he said I could just return it as is.
There's no way I can return it like this!!
That's not true...
And go Wasshoi!! Wasshoi!!
Sorry you had to wait!
Supper time!
Huh...?
It's calm, but there is still tension in the atmosphere.
Annoying.
I'll go! I'm telling you I will go! So let go!
I don't know...
Why am I so excited?
Very well.
W-Wait!
Agreed. We couldn't forget this even if we wanted to. This is terrible.
Ah! It's going to start soon!
Are your studies moving along?
Keita, wear this.
How is it?
OK, let's try hard. Thanks, Riko-nee!
Thanks for the meal. Somehow it seems appropriate to translate this, but not itadakimasu -Pipelynx
Pun on "appu"  up and "appuru"  apple
I know I can only make headbands.
What's this about? I'm not letting you kick me like this.
I won't know with just "there".
No. I'll teach you that I'm not a kid.
Clearly, even now...
Uh, what's the matter? Added by Crust, if it's needed.
How's it going?
Oh, there's something that looks good.
And that remark, to top it off!
1, 2, 3...
So that's that.
It hurts, Kei-chan!
Don't ask me!
Ako-nee, as a thanks and sorry, I'll lick it for you.
I said I'm all right!
Do you think I can do something that embarrassing in front of someone?
Welcome back.
Up until now, I've thought that old men with really sparse hair who go to great lengths to maintain it were incredibly lame.
I now know that each and every one of them is extremely important.
What kind of humiliating thing have we made?
But I don't really...
But with my sisters' vigour... this'll be effective for sure!
Please give me the ability to pass! I beg you, I beg you!
I put it on, see!
...this open!
Isn't this what they call imprudence? wakage no itari, TL is straight from jisho.org -Pipelynxlack of discretion so imprudence -himie
Keita came down with a high fever just before the important exams.
"The sakura petals fall before a dying man." I thought this was a quote from a poem or something, maybe not. I think the falling of sakura petals is indicative of death in japanese culture, but don't quote me on that. Bee: so it's a quote? If it is, better leave it like that and just have an explanation note, me thinks
My beloved Kei-chan would never tell such weak lies! yowane  complaints, soft sound; haku  to tell lies
It doesn't matter if it's a fever or God trying to get in the way.
You see, I'm trying to catch Kei-chan's cold.or another word for take is fine here
Your sis will absorb all of your cold virus along with your saliva. I suggest switching saliva with virus, even though it goes against spoken order.
Got it? Relax.
I licked the sweat off his body.
Don't copy me.
I feel like I'm about to faint.ki ga tooku naru means to faint.
Then I'll lick this side!
Stay still and leave it to me.
Could it be that they're doing this on purpose to make me sweat?
Keita.
Ah well, it can't be helped.
It's warm. I'll leave everything to you two, Nee-chan.
You don't have to see me off. Just go to sleep.
OK!
I envy you.
Eh? You're all so cruel.
Pretty out.
What do I do??
Kei-chan!
It was just laying on the desk. You're too careless.
You two really are twins, even at times like these.
Good luck, Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
W-Why didn't you open your eyes half way? It was a really good chance!
It'll be really exciting, somehow!
Sugar, spice, and everything nice. ...
I get it. Girls are like candy. That's amazing.
Um...
Kisses are prohibited.
Eh... what's up with that?
Well, I am selfish.
But what?
Oh, like what?
Thanks.
They're good.
From our point of view, anyway.
All kinds of unmentionable experiences are waiting for you.
This isn't fair. Why just Keita?
Anyway, I shouldn't get involved in it.
I know! I'll ask for a loan.
This is it. oh my...
Kei-chan.
Keita.
Why did I say something like that?
Riko-nee. Nothing, I was talking about...bb retimed to end later
It's nothing.
Let me see it.
It isn't. It's chocolate.
It's sweet.
Keita, your breathing is labored.erotic, perverted?
Sugar, spice and everything nice.
Don't you want to taste my sweetest spot?
Go eat a late-night meal.
Why don't you just eat this?
That serious look and those sweat droplets which sparkled like crazy.
I'll give you a kiss.
What's wrong...?
Why?
That's because...
Kei-chan, your handkerchief? Your wallet? You didn't forget anything, right?
Right? Right?
Calm down a little.
It's with me!
No, it's with me!
Ri...Ri...Riko-nee.
Um...
With this, it should be all right.
Hey, what are you going to do after graduating?
Why? Why?
Keita-senpai!
We wanted to celebrate because you passed your exams...
We couldn't read the atmosphere...
Keita?
I haven't eaten anything since this afternoon.
This. Here. - NeWbY
Huh?
That is... - NeWbY
I repeat...
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
A-Actually, I think so too.
If Mikuni didn't bring me the certificate of passing,
No, I should be the one... Hmm, that, what was it...
Did something happen?
Isn't it obvious? We're here to get your button.
Keita-senpai is an idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!
You promised me you would give me your second button!
Happy
OK, since it's like this...
I'll start first.
Second.
Everyone wrote something, right?
Then let's start.
Amidanokujide Amidakuji!
Go ahead. Do whatever you like.
OK.
OK, don't hold yourself back, just kiss.
She seems to have more common sense than Ako-senpai when it comes to this.
No, you got the wrong idea!
Seriously...
Even if you ask me...
It's OK! I don't mind if Keita-senpai is a fast one.
Keita.
Wait, what are you doing?
Bear with it.
At the very least, even if it's just this one!
I'm sorry, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
I can't choose between the two of you.
Please wait for me, Keita-senpai!
Riko.
Yeah.
Nothing, we're just a little...
We just thought that you've become an adult as well, Keita.
Celebrate Entrance Ceremony
Go away!
I wonder if I can?
You can. I'm sure of it.
Then can I have the usual?
Listen up Keita.
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Now, let's try this again.
You saw them, didn't you?
Only looking at Riko... It's not fair...
Here! Kei-chan.
Huh?
Ako-nee and Riko-nee are really innocent.
I'm gonna take this time to get his clothes.
Now, Kei-chan's clean clothes...
That's right, these aren't just normal boxers.
These are the boxers that Keita just took off!
You should just go rub yourself with the smell of detergent.
Even though it's just coke.
They went on a neighbourhood association trip.
We can't do this!
And you've always asked for this in the past.
This is just a western greeting.
Just a dream...
Aw, and it was such a rare opportunity.
I-I suppose.
Either way, Keita's current grades are borderline.
Today is Keita's important parent-teacher conference.
That's our male classmates for ya'...
Keita.
Sorry...
Suminoe Keita!
Mikoni, are you ok?
Please listen to the song I wrote.
We were doing this for Keita.
I have something really important to do today.
I guess we did something unnecessary.
Could it be that...
Ako-nee... Riko-nee...
But we did cause more trouble for him.
N-No, but...
Even though you say that,...
I don't want that!
Don't be embarrassed.
A kiss to you!
Are you alright, Kei-chan?
I realize that it's bad, but I just couldn't concentrate.
Ako-nee.
Yes.
Hold on!
I passed as well, didn't I?
Geez, what are you doing?
Really?
Are you making any progress with your studying?
I guess so.
Wait a minute! Are you saying I'm dumb because of genetics?
This isn't something to laugh about.
Oh, right!
Let's keep going for a little bit longer.
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's change our strategy.
Which means...
On my left thigh, it says "look at."
Which means "to watch something."
"F-Finally!"
Ah, good morning.
"Look at."
"Being attracted to..."
It was something... "be..."
What a beast!
So, you aced your English test right?
Yeah, the test was ok, but a lot of other stuff happened as well.
Well then...
Sing Nightingale, about Heiankyo.
What's going on, Keita?
I'm impressed, studying by herself.
Yeah.
Today, I'll teach you all about girls.
W-What was with that dream?!
She's finally helping me study for those tests...
TL Note: "Bakufu" or "Shogunate" is a term used for a shogun's office or government.
When was the Tokugawa Bakufu abolished?
I-It was... 1867.
On with the next one.
Tick... Tock...
No way I could...
W-Wait.
You made it?
It's because you butted in, Riko!
Do your best!
How wonderful!
Home economics class handmade cooking.
I-It's not like that!
I've got a lot of problems of my own.
Why are you doing this?!
Huh? It's a chocolate banana, of course.
Anyway, I'll get out of here before I get dragged into this.
Alright, are there any questions?
Huh?!
O-Oh, swe-swee-swee...
How did what happen?
It's not lipstick, it's chocolate.
And then...
This isn't a kiss.
Together with Ako's cooking, I want to support you while you're studying.
See?
Something like this, I think
What was that? Oil?
This time I'll put some on your tongue, so stick it out.
What is this?
Wait, Keita
It feels like my legs will give way at any moment.
Sitting like this is difficult, let's change our position.
Me neither.
A picture book?
While I was working so hard to get dinner ready...
Huh?
This is?
Next time: A Lover's Capabilities
That's weird.
Aren't they cute?
Like they say, he's a man so he must stand erect!
Y-Yeah.
Well, you're right.
That's the Chief of Police... no, wait, I mean incest.
That's what I'm talking about, get those butts in the air!
I've been thinking about the past.
On your marks.
After his twin sisters, it's his junior?!
Ako-nee... Riko-nee...
Thank you.
More importantly, why don't you pray too?
He's going to get punished.
That was all you had saved up til now.
Both of them!
That's not true, if you ask the gods, it can be done.
Was there so much space here before?
That's why there are still a lot of people who come here for love.
Everyone has to grow up sometime.
Come next spring, Kei-chan will make all of that stop.
Just watch. I'm going to get in Tamahide High for sure!
Yes.
Girls really are all about the breasts.
I'm for curves...
It's just ordinary guy talk, the sole relaxation we students get while studying for entrance exams.
What kind of "guy talk" is this?
Huh?
I'm home!
You can't lose to cheating!
Besides...
Those were big, and squishy...
This won't do, I need to wake up!
Ok, time for some studying in the library.
I didn't know she was the librarian.
Hey!
I'm at my limit.
Ok, I got it open.
Not good!
It's no use.
"That"?
Get on.
This isn't the time to be embarrassed.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, it just happened.
About the peeing, I mean.
Let's go! The town of electronic eroticism!
Uneasiness at Akiba.
This is good.
What's with this cold attitude?
You're satisfied day after day!
I bet you don't have any interest in girls other than Ako and Riko-senpai, anyway.
Huh?
I-I'm sorry.
Shut up.
I smell a girl.
Did Keita cheat or something?
Even without those intentions, it just happens... Right, Keita?
You can't lose to cheating!
Mom, could you give me another cup of coffee?
Those were big, and squishy...
I couldn't keep a single thought inside my head...
This won't do, I need to wake up!
Hurry up!
He's not satisfied enough with his two older sisters, so if it's a cute girl then he's indiscriminate!
If you let your guard down for only a second...
Mikuni Miharu!
I'm getting a hit on my sister-radar.
This door is way too strong.
This is bad!
Wait here.
Get on.
But...
Yeah...
Why is this happening to me...?
I'll take it to my grave.
Please...
That Kei-chan...
Where did he run off to?
Dad sure does know what he's doing.
He even won a PC at his company's bingo event.
But it seems like this dream will never become a reality.
The next stop is Akihabara, Akihabara.
C-C'mon, you as well, Kei-chan?
I see...
Say "nyaa".
What should we do?
Never mind that, just come up with something already.
"Peeing."
"Fingering."
I've had enough.
We have to buy an Eroge.
If he finds out...
Actually, you could look at it this way...
Keita.
Kei-chan, over here.
I get the feeling you guys are hiding something from me today.
People's manners here have gotten really bad lately.
Just let go of it... Already...
Y...es...
Suminoe Riko-san?
Y-You've got it all wrong.
Yeah! I was just looking into the contents of these games I keep hearing about, it's just research. TLC
What do you mean you're buying it?
Now that you mention it, weren't you cosplaying before?
What are you doing on the adult floor?
Nice to meet you.
Yes...
What are you kids thinking! Brother and sister, that's just disgraceful.
This is bad, I have to do something about this kid.
Now is the time to show my skill as a teacher!
I'm going to put my life as a teacher on the line, in order to put you back on the right path.
It's a kind of flirting game.
Our most popular character right now is Naoe Kanetsugu.
D-Don't worry about the details.
I've been listening to you quietly all this time, but just what do you know about us?
Hello, Keita-senpai.
But that's an Eroge.
Since I'm under-aged, I couldn't buy it.
If I don't upload some more, I won't get to access more, either.
I'll make sure to hide your face.
Another 100 to go.
The Fire Fantasy game I ordered last month should be coming in.
Of course! That's my man, you're so loved!
If I didn't tell them I was going to the pool, they would've gotten mad at me.
What should I do?
Wait a sec!
Here you go. That will be 2500 yen.
Y-Yeah... It's just like you, Mikazuki.
Just what should I do, Kanetsugu-sama?!
You want to wait?
What kind of relationship does she have with Keita?
To follow him all the way here, maybe she's...
Are you alright?
That was dangerous.
And another one!
Take this, you pervert!
Weren't you doing more things than us when you were our age?
You don't mean...
That Sensei is still...
More importantly, you'll catch a cold if you don't change out of those clothes, Onee-chan.
This will work, right?
Yeah, thanks.
I've only got this but, if you want...
Roll, roll, roll, let's take of these clammy stockings
You saved me back there.
I'll wash the jersey and give it back to you.
It really tickles my nose.
Indeed, being naked and all.
Wearing a jersey while being naked feels great.
You're so innocent.
Sensei, I can't...
Oh, that won't do,
Sensei.
No, even a third time.
TL Note: a Happi, a coat worn by festival participants
Keita-senpai, just forget about the exams for tonight.
It's because you came and interrupted, Riko.
Then, let me give you an apology kiss.
Wow, this looks great!
This makes my all-nighter so much easier!
In any case, you can't.
It gets pretty hectic every night.
What is it?
Don't turn it around.
But I can't just buy some cheap ready-made chocolate.
I want more.
Please, don't hesitate to let me know.-
How would I...
...you were talking about?this is said by Riko- there are actors for a reason, so use it
I can't.
Why?
Maybe I'll have one more...
Sweets?
Were kisses this sweet?
Wait Keita, my strength is almost gone.
Riko-nee.
While I was preparing a late-night meal you...
Next time: A Lover's Qualifications. A Lover's Qualifications
That's it for today, keep up the good work.
Doing this and that
It's just like the calm before the storm.
What are you saying? He's going with me!
We could do that.
What's up!
My old yukata is kind of tight as well.
You're always clinging to him too much.
I don't know.
It's fine,
Is it the festival? Is it because we're at a festival?
What are you doing?
Jeez... You always keep interrupting us at the good part!
Kei-chan!
Are you okay, Nee-chan?
Keep going where?
To someplace darker and quieter. A really nice place.
Summer is so full of a feeling of freedom that it becomes the most dangerous season.
This must be a rendezvous,
I gave it my best.
Isn't it sexy?
Ako, what's with that look? You're all sticky.
I can't hold it any longer, I'll have to do it here.
You really are an unreliable character.
There are exam students all over the country.
Ako-nee's midnight snacks are the best.
From today until the exams, I'll be preparing a special victory menu!
That's great!
Thanks for the meal.
Or should I say scores going upples.
Just kidding!gj nixx Moshi
Well, we did show each other our naked bodies in the bathroom before...
Riko-nee looks kind of cute...
I couldn't possibly be joking about something like this.
I'm wearing thin sweats, so I can even feel each of Riko-nee's toes...!
It's not only its shape, it's hot and feels like it's ready to burst...
This is bad,
Let's see... They say that it has an enormous effect with exams, gambling and other single-match events...
Riko!!
Well well, you just have to think about it for a bit.
What do you think Keita would do if we gave him two charms when he's saying he doesn't even need one?
But how am I...
I'm going to end up looking like a baby.
Ako-nee! Let me lick it to make it up for you!
Wait...!
I told you that you can't, Kei-chan!
Ako, don't you think you've become really perverted lately?
I'm so sorry, old people.
If you open it, you'll fail!
You WILL fail.
Don't you ever open it!
treat-ment.
What are you saying?
...to get taken care of.
You've been working so hard yet you're saying this?!
A-Ako-nee!
Next one's gonna be a deeper kiss, okay?
That hurt!
Jeez.
You did, didn't you?
Keita.
Jeez... I guess I can't help it.org: I guess there's nothing I can do about it.ffs this shit again -nx
I lofscx200-
Keita, you idiot.
Damn, what a lucky guy.
before we start the exam, I would like to inform you about some warnings and the schedule.warnings?
I can't let that happen, even if it costs me my life as a teacher.TLC'd
No matter what kind of a problematic child he may be,
Ako-nee, your exam ID!
Okay?
That isn't something a high school girl should say...TLC'd
Keita.
No, I'm not saying that...
As I thought, they're sleeping.
Why are they sleeping together?
Even when sleeping...
I've got to say, I did a good job of holding back against these sisters.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
There's a lot of problems, but...
Ako.
W-W-Why couldn't we open our eyes immediately?
My, my. But Keita is my child!
Yeah, that's good.
Hey...
It's because my happy-go-lucky-wonderful-high-school-life with you depends on these announcements!on the result of these announcements - you could go as far as saying "It's because my life-long dream of a happy-go-lucky-wonderful-high-school-life with you is dependent on the results of this!"
With me!
TL Note: A pun on the word Ochiru to fallfail.
Adios!
What's wrong?
It's none of your concern!
Keita-senpai!
She's your little sister, isn't she, Sensei?
Education... Teaching...
You know, if you keep up that attitude, you're going to fail next year as well!
Why...
Kei-chan?
But...
Umm... Mikuni... Mikuni Miharu-san, was it?
Kenta!
I did it!
Suminoe-kun.
Yay!
Yes!
Keita-senpai!
I, too, will be a high school student this spring.
Wh-What do you mean?
You didn't really study as hard as you say you did, right?
A-Actually, I could ask you all the very same.
Loosen up a bit, man!C'mon, talk back a bit, will you?
A-And... about before, well...
Just make sure your sisters don't catch you.
Ah! Senpai!
Please, accept these and our fiery feelings!
For those who couldn't participate in the scramble for his second button,
I-I just got dragged along... Kind of...
Now that everyone's written something, did we forget anything?
I mustn't laugh... I mustn't laugh...
O-Okay, let's move on.
My goal is the prize I came up with: to be alone with Keita.
Now, now. No need to feel shy. Just give him a quick smooch!
I'm sorry, I pass.
She has a lot more common sense than Ako-senpai in that case.
This is...
You've already graduated and before you know it... right?You're already graduating... Oh, how the time passes, right?
After all, in the olden days you'd be a fine adult already, Keita.
I'll just go to bed.
If I don't want to become jealous, I've got no other choice but to do it like this.
Kei-chan.
Hey, what are you doing?
The school?
an9The years have passed quickly even in the garden of teaching
I wasn't able to tell him that we're both attending the same school.
How should I act when I bump into him there?
Go away!
Stop bullying him!
And here is one guy, and we don't know why, who lives with them together!
It just went through me when I heard "meal" and "bath".
Jeez...
They seem to be like when we were little.
Kei-chan's room!
Ahh, Kei-chan...
A pervert, there's a pervert in here.
Just give it to me now!
Where are my pants?
Because I trusted a certain Idiot to take care of it!
Well, that's fine, but where are father and mother?
Anyway, tonight...
Tomorrow is the parent and child meeting. What should I do about that?
Jeez, what irresponsible parents I have...
Now I'm safe.
Kei-chan...
You can't do that I tell you!
This is just a western greeting...
Why are you in such a hurry?
OK...
that he wouldn't attend the High School he was recommended for but attend the same school as we.
Looks like I'm still on time.
Riko-senpai you said?!
This school's boys are...
Envious! Riko-senpai, me too! Right here! Right here!
No way...
Sorry...
Suminoe Keita!
Mikuni, are you alright?
We are... annoying...
Is this the reason why Ako-nee and Riko-nee came here?
Ako-nee... Riko-nee...
Kei-chan!
Well, I guess it can't be helped.
Don't spout out such shit!
Keita is my child from my previous marriage,
Intense!
Next time: Lesson for just the two of them!
No, not really...
Kei-chan?
But you got also half of it wrong, huh?
I won't leave it to luck!
Right now you have to concentrate on your studies.
Ako-nee...
Even if you say that... Teaching him is impossible I guess...
But I can still take care of the lower part of his body!
Gosh... Now that is has come to this...
Yeah!
So you bombed your test?
You couldn't remember anything?
It can't be helped. My method to teach you was wrong.
It means...
No, that's fine, make sure to memorize it.
Kyoumi ga aru.
It should be "be"...
Here's a molester!
Today it's gonna be history classes.
Then how did she teach you?
In order to make it more smooth rub it with salt...
About ten minutes ago?
Don't change subjects!
You don't have to be that shocked.
Well, we already did a small test in school.
Oh yeah, if you get the correct answers...
How about getting a kiss from me?
That would be just a penalty game... wouldn't it?
Yes... It's a penalty game...
Please... Hurry...
Ako-nee...
And I thought about not interfering with you.
Next time: Alluring sweets!
So, was it sweet?
It's because you interrupted us!
It's because you let him slip away from you.
Well then, let me give you a kiss as apologize!
Today is a homemade Chinatown-seafood special!
What? What's that supposed to be?
Ihi...
No, no, no, no!
Huh? It's a chocolate banana, don't you know?
I guess there's no other way but to buy something...
Concentration...
Ahh, damn it! I can't concentrate!
Keita...
B-Because I said that kissing is not allowed!
I can give you seconds as much as you want.
I'll do it for you...
I've never put on lipstick before.
She even misspelled it...
This time I want to put it on your tongue.
S-Sorry, I've stained it...
Idiot!
Picture book?
BAM
Keita!
And I wanted a bit more...
Eat me...
Haven't we experienced such a situation before?
Ako and Riko are Middle Schoolers...
We're going to change...
Keita has become quite cold towards them lately.
Ah! I want those wonderful days to return!
That's not good! What a dangerous matter!
I got it. Let's try it!
And Selfish!
Truly the worst!
Ako, what are you doing?
If they see someone they don't know they will get suspicious of us.
Right now, we have to endure it...
Kei-chan! Hurry!
Senpai...
Well, you know, that is... Look!
Everyday?
Fail! Fail! Fail!
Oh right, since we're already here, how about holding a wedding ceremony?
Damn it... You're making me remember unnecessary things...
Let's cut that topic!
Why not?
That's why there are still a lot of people who come here and pray for love success.
Ako-sama
This one as well!
It's impossible!
Pops, why didn't you tell me
that you can't marry two people in Japan!?
Doing this is absolutely pointless!
It probably started that time...
Being more distant to them on purpose so I wouldn't hurt myself...
In the first place, I can't do that if I won't pass.
Ako-nee... Would that be fine with you?
Just you watch! I'll definitely get into Tamahide!
Kei-chan!
For me it's the hip!
No! No matter what you say, it's bras under wet shirts!
Here, Kei-chan! Enjoy it!
What happened, Kei-chan?
Something like "Keita is unfaithful"?
Fight!
Compared to my sisters they were...
Wicked mind, disperse! Lust, disperse!
Supreme perfect enlightenment!
I couldn't get anything else in my head...
This is no good! Open your eyes, you're gonna take High School exams soon!
Some Keimi girl from Middle School saw him molesting a High School girl in the amusement quarters of a town next to ours.
No! No! No!
I should apologize to her after all, but... I can't find the right timing...
Thank goodness, now I can finally...
Wait a moment!
Keita: EHHHHHH?!
The door is just too hard... Damn...!
A, B, C...
Gymnastic Storehouse
There he is!
We give you a kiss!
For goodness' sake! What do you think you're doing?!
Hey, Keita, you shouldn't say things like that.
Mom, that's not really helping...T: wtf is Horo ni nattenai?
A boy? But he's your brother, right?
No! Ako-san can't possibly be in love with...
What should I do?
I hate them!
Hey, Keita's going.
Probably?
Mikazuki.
Is there no limit to his lust?!
We just need to be patient until Kei-chan gets accepted into Tamahide High.
She was praying for you to get rejected.
fs40Let me be Oomiya-kun's girlfriend! ...please! - Miki
Through the "reaching out" part, your wish of being accepted comes true.
If Ako and Riko saw this, they wouldfscx200-
Ako.
If it comes to this, I'll kill Suminoe-kun then kill myself.
Winning a PC in a Bingo-Lottery at his workplace...
Keita, you're still a kid, aren't you?
The next station is: Akihabara, Akihabara!
Nyan
How cute!
Sleepless night? Why?
It blocks porn sites so children can't watch them...
They shouldn't be typical words that are typed in commonly.
 "Peeing", "Urination", "Piss-Mania"...
You're only concentrating on one category!
It's settled... It's gonna be Ero-Games!
To buy me an Ero-Game...
Keita!
No no...
But-
We also have cosplays for couples!
Ah, well then, we'll take that!
No, not yet.
Jeez, I'll give you a hand then!
Or, should I just say that this might be more stimulating for you than walking around nude...?
Now get into your outfit already!
This calls for education!
What am I supposed to do...?
Running away is win
I wanted a picture of me doing cosplay...
Kiryuu-sensei?
I'm going to get that Ero-Game back, help me.
No, I only intended to make sure that you can't buy something like this!
Sensei, are you possibly an Otaku...?
We were pursuing our dream, I guess...
Suminoe Ako's...
What the heck were you all thinking?!?
I feel happy I guess...
No one will disturb us here now!
I'm going to show you to put an end to your forbidden relationship!
Yes!
AHH! Dear brother, your cannon is too large! I'm about to surrender!
love between siblings is the worst thing!
Hello, Ako and Riko-senpai!
Kiryuu-sensei is your sister?
In this game there's a comic character of my favorite manga artist.
Someone who was about buy it
I wanted to have it so badly...
And when I became so sad about that,
...And she would take care of that until I become an adult...
See you again, Keita-senpai!
And do it bolder!
You're going to put this on our blog?
Don't worry, don't worry, I'm going to hide your face properly before that!
He-! Mikazuki!
Let me give you a massage as thanks!
Showing off with your relaxed preparations for exams and flirting with your junior huh?
It's summer time! The last summer for us Middle Schoolers!
I'll hold onto this for a while...
and I'd be able to meet my beloved Kanetsugu-sama...
Ako, hurry up!
Keita-senpai, me too!
With so much money I could buy cup noodles in a 100 Yen shop...
Well, we're finally at the pool, so let's swim together.
Jeez, don't say such things!
It can't be helped, let's wait.
Too bad there's an unnecessary third wheel with us.
Could it be someone taking peeping photos?
Didn't we already tell you that we aren't blood-related?
That's why she's so stubborn when it comes to love issues.
It smells quite of sweat.
I'll clean your jersey and return it.
He'd be more happy if there's the scent of an adult on it-
Well then...
Mikazuki-chan must have a hard time with a teacher as her sister.
...the jersey...
Wearing this jersey... feels good...
It's fine.
How are they...?
S-Sensei...
One Japanese yam for only 800 Yen!
A summer festival!
They're much easier to understand than the classes in school...
Thank you for introducing me such a good place.
A-Ako-nee!
You will feel the fear and pain only at the beginning.
N-No, nothing...
I have to escape, at once!
OK?
So you don't... This time...
No! No! No!
I need to go to the toilet...
Again?!
This is quite the far away place here, why are you bringing me here?
So you're still scared.
You kept clinging onto us the whole time
Isn't it a festival...?
Elder sister - Fate
Am I like the midsummer fairy?
Then why did we laugh just now?
Huh? You'd like to have an effective charm for your exams?
Next time: Place your faith in the deities in times of suffering!
Oh, it's getting darker already!
No matter if it's joy or pain... this winter depends on my endurance!
Kei-chan, it's time for dinner!
Yeah, I kind of get the fighting spirit! This is wonderful!
Let's dig in!
You can have more of it tomorrow!
Just kidding!
Ah, I'm sorry! Did I hit you?
Just say it.
It's all your fault!
You accidentally turned the switch on...
At least say that you will take responsibility.
It's nothing...
Maybe it's just hot in here.
Ah well, it's kinda hot.
After this, I have to pray three more times today!
Oh, I have to go. See ya!
How is it going?
Look, that one there looks good.
One...
Two...
That we don't have to go through hard times like these alone...
Ako...
Their noise is so annoying...
Phew...
When did we decide to make one together?
Let Kei-chan...
No... don't!
I'm pulling now, Ako-nee!
I got one!
Oh...
Keita...
Until now I thought that uncles who were trying hard to style their last hair were ugly...
Huh?
For me?
Well...
Thanks!
Really? Wow...
I'll give him everything he wants!
Hihi...
No...
I guess getting ill can't be helped...
Why don't we tend to him with care?
Excuse me...
Because I'm an idiot...
See? You feel better now!
No! Don't move!
Then I go for your lips next, OK?
W-What did you just say?
I think I'm gonna lose consciousness...
You did, right?
I'll make it clean...
I'm revived!
Keita, you idiot!
Hey! What is she doing?
What's with that reaction?
Or rather, fail!
Someone as you who got to be nursed by Ako-Riko-senpai has no right to speak!
What am I saying?
This is education... This is love!
How do you feel?
Quiet down...
He's doing his best so he can attend the same High School as me.
Now that I think about it, do you remember the time when we took our exams?
Without us noticing it, he really became great...
Seems like the fever is getting to you.
Keita...
It should be OK, I was able to remain calm till the end.
Can you believe me?
I really thank you for all that you've done for me until today.
Please get over the fever soon and return to normal, so that we can have more good times together.
We sure have a lot of problems too,
It's a nice day!
You did it, Keita!
Look, my lucky item...
Banner says: Tamahide senior High School entrance exam successful applicants
I did it man! I passed, Keita!
These books are from my relatives who are running a cram school. If you want, you can give them a call.
How can you possibly understand our feelings?
You are awesome, you are awesome Keita-senpai!
Ehh! Can it be?
But accepting it straight on is also a shape of love.
Thank you for next year!
Cheers!
Well...
Where did he go?
Erm, are you opening it in this place?
I did it!
Congratulations...
The three of us will be together again!
Yes!
Heeeeehhhhhhh?
Suminoe Keita.
You didn't really study that hard for the exam, right?
Did anything happened?
No it's mine!
You promised Mikazuki-chan?
Well, how about it?
If you like, please take my button!
What should we do?
Please accept our second button...
Everyone has written down, right?
Do whatever you want.
Please keep your panties on!
In some way, she's a formidable rival...
She has more common sense than Ako-senpai in this area.
Do...?
So what should we do?
No, what's with me at a place like this?
Suminoe-kun doesn't know that I will go to Tamahide senior high as well.
I'm relieved.
That's it, time is up!
Really, since when have they already graduated?
A powerful rival has made her appearance, hasn't she?
Kei-chan's other graduation ceremony.
We'll do it together...
Keita-senpai! I'll be taking your second button!
Ehh?
That Keita...
Ahh! Even though you said that you have not changed earlier.
It can't be helped.
Keita.
Not there!
In the school library!!!
It's your sisters in their uniforms.
Cute, aren't they?
There's nothing we can do. He's going through puberty.
He can't always be close to his sisters.
Well, a man's gotta learn to stand on his own two feet.
Ako, do you have a brother complex?
I mean... incest?
We felt exactly the same way in junior high.
Set.
There's no way. It's too late to catch up to them now.
I feel lonely because I can't see him, but...
Stop!
Where do you think you're going?
First his twin sisters, now he's going after a junior?
But I want to see him now. I want to see him now. I want to see him now.
Don't tell him!
Sorry.
Riko, some are for us...
But even if they ask... you'll stop all of them next spring, right Kei-chan?
Ako-nee, are you all right with that?
Kei-chan.
I love you too.
I want to run away, but I can't. bSorry!
Yeah right.
There isn't one instance in a billion.
Even if you don't mean it, it just goes by itself, right Keita?R: is the first sentence in past or present tense?
Mom, another cup of coffee.
You probably don't have any other interests besides Ako-Riko senpai.R: same as same line mentioned above.
Kei-chan.
Okay.
A girl named Keimi from F-middle school saw him at the town across doing things to a high school girl.
If you show any opening...
We have to deliver Kei-chan an umbrella... as older sisters.
Yeah, as older sisters.
Wait... Umm... Mikuni Miharu!
Keita: Are you feeling ill?
Look, we can probably get out from there.
Slowly, okay?
But...
I'll clean this up.
No... Suminoe-kun is... My...
This is all Mikuni's urine, huh?R: yay! months of doing urinanalysis made me immune to this stuff.
Please do.
Geez... Kei-chan...

He takes advantage of that momentary opportunity and steals possession.
Brazil's defense is closing in, but he slips past one
My bad, brother. I mean, I'm sorry, Captain.
Suguru-senpai!
Wow! He looked over here!
Switch it up!
my dream is to stand there, too.
How cute!
I'm Seven.
Suguru-san was the leader,
Nana Mishima
When we were in elementary school, she was a forward
Suguru-san!
Kakeru, where are you going?
To the convenience store.
Hey! Wait!
My left!
Could it be my brother?
You guys really have no sense of anxiety, do you?
Kakeru Aizawa, where's your response?
You're just scared of showing your true self in front of other people.
What's going on?
Hurry up.
To be honest, I was frustrated.
but to be able to run around this field again
with my brother...
Hey, Kakeru, look.
Seven joined the club as a manager
so if one penetrating pass gets through, they'll be in trouble.
They need to feel the zone better and keep it compact.
Um... so the defensive midfielder is in outer space
No. This pass is...
What? Where I watch from is my choice, isn't it?
What?
even for Suguru-san, to make that pass to Kakeru.
If you're a forward, you need to look like you want that pass.
I'll definitely give you the pass, if you call for it.
Getting a decisive pass into the area
Instead, he took an extra step so he could shoot with his right.
That gave the keeper an instant
If he had shot with his left, he would've scored.
Kakeru's always like this...
since he was Suguru-san's brother.
Kakeru...
and I finally receive that unsuppressed pass.
He went with his left!
No buts about it.
Yes! All right! I'm in!
I'm not being sarcastic. I really think so.
and the long shot for the second...
On the other hand, I sure feel bad for Kakeru-san.
I really sympathize.
You mean, when Ishikawa returns, I'm off the team?
But Kakeru missed pass after pass while I scored on the first one.
were all serious passes.
Even if you're the conductor,
It's no good. I can't use Kakeru in a match.
he'd moved into the defender's blind spot
Nishijima was subbed in, and he was able to score.
Exactly.
But...
Welcome home...
but do you think you could go all out with me tonight?
When I was in elementary school, during a practice match,
and his leg bent in a weird direction.
Then just be clear about it!
Hey, Kake-nii. Cut it out.
Here.
It's nothing. Man, I'm hungry.
Actually, I was thinking of telling you after practice,
I'm quitting the soccer club.
You don't have to worry about me anymore.
then the striker is the knight.
A knight in the area.
Even though you're only a year older than me.
You must be able to see yourself
A knight in the area...
Kakeru, who do you think it was...
who received that pass?
A bag from our school?
against the German women's champions, SF Frankfurt.
Hey, hey!
I'm confiscating it.
Huh?
so I can pull it off in a game.
What's wrong?
We can't continue like this.
SC under Coach Kondo had a sense of tension.
We're resuming practice.
Sorry.
Takase! Fore-check!
Kaoru-chan!
Sharpen your reflexes.
My bad.
but this time he grabbed my shirt and pulled me to the ground.
Huh?
It's nothing.
Asuka-san is called the emperor of Kanagawa, right?
Yes. They're a veteran team that
advances to the finals every year.
Brazil's Jewel is at a Japanese High School?
I wonder if it has something to do with you, Kakeru-kun.
Look. The article even says maybe he
Kakeru,
Takase.
After what happened yesterday,
I want to go to Takase's house and apologize.
You're the younger brother?
Actually, I wanted to talk to him.
Of the sports where you can go pro and make money,
and put Mom and Dad at ease.

I can't help but feel I should be grateful

Because it's the soccer that he
Mishima-san?
She's good.
What's this? There are a lot of absentees today.
Of the former SC members... only two showed up.
Kakeru continues to run alone to try to bring everyone together.
Hurry, Kakeru! Faster, faster!
Unsatisfied with Coach Iwaki's management,
the Enoshima Soccer Club threatens to divide again.
Wait, but...
Oh, no. Of course, I do want you to return,
we've borrowed a private stadium to practice in.
I was wondering who that might be...
Safety First
And what has made that possible,
by never ceasing his pursuit of greater heights,
Where have I seen that guy before?
That's the spirit, Araki-kun.
All right.
Yeah! Nice, Araki!
That's the Enoshima High "Seal-kun" for you.
Okay!
No way, no way!
so why do we have to go watch their match?
Team First Half Second Half
defensive connections like that.
They're not that weak when it comes to defense.
They have to hurry and take Araki...
he probably will.
That's...
We did it! We did it!
One more goal. We've gotta catch up.
but, even so, I still feel...
Welcome back, Kakeru.
Seven, is this...
Hey, wait! Hey!
Hurry up and change. Everyone's waiting.
What pulled them together was
the feelings born in them themselves.
With yesterday's match,
the strategy from here on out will be a little...
And...
Then, to go along with this system,
Second year, Reo Kurebayashi-kun.
Akito Horikawa-kun.

Whoa!
Their field has real grass
They can go straight to Keiso University after graduation,
Hey, Kakeru!
Yes.
I don't really understand,
Look over here!
I'll kill you!
I'd like to begin the high school soccer
Kanagawa qualifiers second match,
Nakajima-kun! Shimatani-kun!
Damn. They're underestimating us.
Enoshima is strong.
We've even got Araki-san, the player you admired.
Yusuke, where's Suguru's brother?
A rabbit caught in a trap
All right.
If we're up by three, we can substitute in the first half.
Nice save.
Unlike the first half, in the second half,
Coach, he's at his limit.
Kota-kun,
I'm definitely going to score a goal!
But if we put in three offensive players at once,
what comes after this game, and recreating his team.
Because he's been moving his heavy body around constantly,
If you had been there, we wouldn't have lost!
A striker who can show me a world
Sounds like a brother complex.
Araki-san!
Ball?
Huh?
The powerful special move born of coincidence.
Kakeru tries it out numerous times in a match,
It is far from being complete,
but Kakeru should be able to...
I won't let you through!
Number 20, Aizawa is substituted
Don't you think that gives you plenty of opportunities to shoot?
That would just mean running away.
All right!
if he can still be an egoist,
That's the game!
3-1. That's impressive.
When I first heard the lineup, I was a little worried...
Perhaps we should stay to watch the next game?
Yes. They use a four back system that,
in the last five years.
in the Holland Junior League,
Huh? But we're playing the winner.
Iwaki-kun, I'll stay and watch this game.
Then, Mishima-san, let me know how the game goes.
That's fine. I'll leave it to you.
Really...
Kakeru, what did you just try to do?
Quiet.
Now, now.
Tsujido has the ball.
Huh? What happened?
I-I can't believe it.
started to fall apart after this.
Yes!
Yes.
Enoshima High is my alma mater, too.
Kakeru-kun did lose his brother, so...
What did Dr. Mine want?
I heard Suguru-san passed away...
It was amazing.
So I always wondered how you were doing.
I haven't healed!
but it was just the same thing again and again.

Hibino continued to play soccer on his unrecovered knee.
The time has finally come!
You're annoying!
Show 'em!
The two-back system we've seen in past matches is here again.
Sawamura-san!
Kyousuke Hasegawa, in a one-top formation.
Left the group and went back to soccer?
I'm counting on you.
No. He approached his mark from a blind spot
All right.
Kimu comes upfield for the throw-in.
Takase-kun, cover the goal!
towards the Enoshima goal.
Takase clears it!
Nice defense by Horikawa.
All right!
Will it be a dribble penetration or a throughpass?
leaving the sides wide open.
and go for a sideline penetration!
Sawamura-san and Sakamoto-san are running up the sides.
With Oda-san's long feed, this might be a chance!
but now that I think about it, the opponent at the time,
This is an opportunity.
We're not letting you through!
Here we go!
Seems a little over-eager.
Not with Tsujidou still in the penalty area!
That had to be offsides, right?
their bodies just didn't respond in time.
That was my mistake.
Don't aim for the opponent's sidelines carelessly.
Oh, no!
2-1!
Too cautious of Kimu's long throw,
Why are you bringing this up?
Junpei!
This is a disastrous situation for Enoshima.
I won't let you through here.

Aizawa!
The match against Tsujidou.
and the plays that seem to belong to another person.
Kakeru, caught up in the moment,
Shindou!
What?
Hey Kakeru, what were
Hasegawa, stay behind!
right to Aizawa.
Enoshima's first year, Kakeru Aizawa,
I feel like I'd be able to have fun playing soccer with him.
Ah, yes!
Takase jumps to reach it!
In a one goal lead situation,
Although he's an opponent,
Yeah! Get out of my way!
into the team they are now.
That's Uryu for you.
Coach Iwaki, Tsujido's Coach Uryu is...
Go, Enoshima!
Honestly, when Kimu's long throw was sealed,
We'll stop you!
but Coach Uryu beat into us
I did it!
Tsujido
We aren't going down here!
In these last moments,
Will there be a throw-in?
Yes!
Get out, keeper!
He did it!
What was that play?
Th-The ball was right there.
Until the whistle blows, no one knows what might happen.
No matter what,
The whistle hasn't blown yet.
Enoshima beats Tsujido by one goal, 3-2,
What, Jun Hino? Still got a problem?
That's not it.
That's how we've been playing up until now!
No matter what you do, you'll try hard.
Coach Iwaki.
The real goal is beyond.
No, no, no.
episode 17: "Leonardo Silva"
Not only was it successful, but he went on to score
Oh, you're right.
Kakeru!
Enoshima starts to come back.
but it's proceeding surprisingly well.
You don't remember?
I knew I needed to chase the ball.
After the heart transplant,
is completely fine.
My brother...
Wh-Who are you?
Amazing!
What evidence do you have?
It's easy to predict.
Show me what you're made of.
I'm going to see if that's true, by pretending to be you.
You can't!
Wait!
Right now.
and run on the field with you.
The ball at my feet feels like a part of my body.
This feeling is...
You too, Suguru.

I really did, Robbie.
Suguru is alive inside him,

He's Suguru Aizawa.
This is the first time soccer has got me so excited!
Leonardo Silva...
Of course.
You really are amazing.
Suguru!
Next time, we'll finish this, Suguru.
Who is that girl?
Kakeru sometimes appears to play like a different player,
Coach Iwaki, I've finished.
We'd all like to come cheer you on,
I'm off!
Are you sick?

Amazing, Takeda-san.

It doesn't matter if you double team me.

I hope you keep up that attitude.
Jeez...

This is a chance for the selection team.

The ball goes to Ishiki below top.
Will they make a follow up goal,
or will League Selection make a comeback play?
Murasaki-san can reach it.
Mishima's powerful pass
Yeah, that was amazing.
Ishiki's one goal,
Excuse me.
Kakeru.
Kakeru, I'm glad.
The fruit of my labor as a coach is you, Ishiki.
I'll do it!
to call the defending "four rows" the best.
Left forward: the Enoshima Tower, Michiro Takase.
Finally, the fateful face-off
against Kakeru's old friend, Koichi Hibino,
Seven, I'm going to score this time!
Now, it's Enoshima's, and Kakeru's, turn.
Right!
Araki is really into it.
Less than one minute since the kickoff,
Once Araki-san gets going, he can't be stopped easily.
The keeper Komada deflects it.
He's dangerous.
Yusuke, you put Kakeru on a pedestal. Right, Takajo-san?
What?
So close.
and maybe he saw an opening?
Takase-kun had Hiruma-san, who was just as tall,
had Hibino-kun on him.
Mako-san was double marked by two midfielders,
The first thing that comes to mind would be...
And also,
No, I can't.
Hey, Hibino. Don't you have something to say?
From here on out, I'm counting on you.
Unfortunately, this will be a substitution.
This is bad. It may have been the ball,
Kakeru-kun, I'm counting on you.
Yes.
Captain Sawamura takes the ball.
The Araki I know isn't about dribbling or long passes.
to Aizawa!
Go, Kakeru!
Highlight or not,
it means nothing if he doesn't score.
He, Suguru's brother, hesitated for a moment.
It didn't seem like we could lose to Enoshima.
we've never failed to be in the finals.
You should've scored with that sort of timing.
What did you think of Kakeru-kun's play, Mishima-san?
Okay.
It just came to me.
Back!
a6All right!
What?
This is bad.
That was their good play, not your fault.
We were attacking the whole time and I was getting bored.
My brother wouldn't flinch at something like this.
You've got guts, Kakeru.
Hibino, don't focus on Aizawa and lose your concentration.
Idiot! You held back!
Seven, I'm not alone!
Kakeru!
Are you all right?
Kakeru.
All right, let's change it up.
The forward shouldn't be...
it's that kind of feeling.
Yes!
He's past.
Now!
With only moments left in the first half,
I met that Hibino guy once before.
What?
He still thinks about that?
I won't let you!
This is how it should be.
In order to push Enoshima, we're going to need your strength.
Don't you think that's amazing?
Shonan has changed one player.
Correct.
Okay.
Kaiouji goes after it.
and score points with free kicks.
Araki-san...
If we lose like this,
Yes.
Enoshima brings in for the right defensive midfielder,
All right. Let's try out Coach's idea.
He reads who the central player for the next play will be
Goal!
Yes!
Hibino!
Shonan's Four Rows is on the attack!
Enoshima goes on to the Top 8!
I didn't say that because I thought lightly of your endurance.
I suppose.
Hey, Kakeru.
So, what did you want to talk about?
Three goals in three halves.
Does the Little Witch practice, too?
What was that?
Hey, I'll give you this.
when I told him that I was quitting the club,
A metal pipe puncturing his chest.
Oh, sorry, Brother.

The older brother's head injury was also quite serious.
A girl. Aren't you guys glad?
Um... hello. My name is Nana Mishima.
Nice to meet you.
Seven...
Sir, Ma'am,
we did everything we could,
was just determined to be brain dead.
Unfortunately...
No!
Sir, Suguru-kun is an organ donor, correct?
What's wrong?
The day after tomorrow is the semi-finals.
I'm home!
How was the match?
If Seven assisted,
then Kake-nii, you had an easy point, right?
Well spotted...
I'll never forget that promise.
All right?
You're the girl who always comes and visits, right?
so I should be released soon.
It's a pretty big decision
about his brother.
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, Kakeru.
What's wrong with all of you?
Brother!
was transplanted into Kakeru?!
Tour de France!
You seem energetic.
I'm fine!
Even with the donor and recipient being brothers,
Hurray!
Hurray! Hurray!
Kakeru?
Kakeru,
What does someone who just runs away know about me?
and Seven and I were on the two forwards.
What the
Next time on The Knight in the Area:
The appearance of Tsukumo-san, the fifth arrow,
The one who scored it is none other than this man,
From that distance? You've got to be kidding.
He caught them off guard, but he's still amazing.
Ippei!
Takajo is heading up,
Takajo starts running with his defenders still on him.
Will Sera go to Takajo after all?
What could this be?
Should we really be resting at such a crucial time?
Remember that and rest up.
It's so busy!
Hey, Seven, do you remember?
That's right! I remember!
What? No idea.
Don't give me that.
We have a winner!
Kakerucchi!
What a coincidence!
It's boring by myself.
M-Mai-chan.
You're all here, too?
Hey, Araki, what's that?
What is it?
Blue D Cat!
That is, if you don't want to get hurt.
Kakerucchi, you're hilarious.
I wonder if I was a little out of line.
Yeah, let's do it.
Ah! I drank both!
What about you, Witch?
Kakerucchi, of course.
Well, uh...
Here. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Wait.
Take this.
She went home?
It's beautiful.
I want to win and keep playing soccer with him.
My father thinks that I've been possessed by soccer.
As a break from studying,
but I was happy just kicking the ball.
I know why you're frustrated.
but you've got a talent that I'm jealous of.
You're so full of it.
Captain Sawamura?
What about you, Kakeru-kun?
You all have overcome numerous tough matches to get to this point
After that, let's beat Kamakura in the semifinals,
Seven, Asuka-san really is amazing!
But we can't relax forever.
Over here! Over here!

Asuka and Onimaru get all the attention,

Kaoru-kun is open!
Number 2, Mukai, blocks his path...
Go!
Matoba's cross goes over Hino's head...

No!
It's offsides. The offsides flag is up.
Because Hino-kun was already in an offsides position,

Yes.
Nice timing.
Inaba, number 19.
On Araki is number 6, Sendo,
The Enoshima tower, Takase,
It's a great mark that's pushing Aizawa out of the area.
That number 5 is good.
I wonder.
Once you've seen it, you can counter it.
what do you regard as unpredictable, Asuka-san?
Because I don't know what it is,
Hino is chasing down Oda's pass.
It's Asuka!
but he's already back on defense.
What a player.
Ri-san!
No, wait. This is...
That guy...
That's the result of endless and tiring practice.

Everyone worked hard to get the ball to you...
they won't be able to move forward, or even pass it on.
That won't happen.
It's Asuka.
At the same time he calls out to the keeper,
Enoshima is making a substitution.
Coach, even though we've increased

The forward, Hino, moves in for a fast check.

That goal wasn't because Enoshima's defense fell apart.
What's wrong, Yusuke? You were spacing out.
Yeah.
Wait for the signal to go on the offensive.
Crush, crush, crush!
Yes. I'll definitely do my job as a striker.
Takase is within middle shot distance,
A middle shot!
Asuka hits it,
It appears that it's still early for the total defense.

He looks like he's in pain.

If all goes well.

Kakeru has already accepted defeat in his heart.
However, under the control of

With defenders hot on his heels,
He slipped past his mark,

Kakeru.
Just one goal. Let's take it back.
The ball is loose.
Damn it!
Asuka sends the ball over to the other side.
Get back!
It's Asuka again.
Sawamura-san.
Yes.
Then consider this:
The playmaker.
The defensive midfielder's position.
your judgment style has an all encompassing view.
Listen, Oda-kun, soccer is a lot like go.
How can you put someone in there
On the other end of that pass is...
Damn it...
as long as Asuka is there in the end,
Please do something, Enoshima!
Do you really believe that, Kakeru?
That libero-like number 5 is good, too.
No chance of winning?
Is that so?
However, the Yoin defense has swiftly regrouped.
There's no space for a dribble penetration.
The keeper jumps out.
and, in the end, sent the ball through the keeper's legs!
All right!
Let's tie it up.
We still have time!
That's not it.
he played as if he had been possessed, like now.
It's as if I'm watching Suguru.
He's broken into a dribble.
he's once again headed into Yoin's side.
No matter how you look at it, he's not Kakeru.
Push towards Aizawa!
Wait for me.
Who am I making a play for here?
It connects! It's a direct volley!
Until we take the lead!
The match against Yoin finally reaches a conclusion.
Somethings different from the usual Kakerucchi.
You should already know, Ricky,
Oh, nothing.
Let's stop thinking about it.
Only four minutes plus loss time remain in the game.
While the defender was worrying about Aizawa,
Nakatsuka is running up the left side.
Nakatsuka still isn't stopping.
He can make it to the cross.
Don't get ahead of yourself!
Nakatsuka crosses at the last second.
I won't let you shoot.
Brother...
That girl...
Oh, stop it. I was worried about you.
Along with Mishima, she's one of Nadeshiko's key players.
Are you stupid? I only respect her as a player.
Well? It suits me, right?
Coach!
When I asked my doctor
What?
Asuka's shot was right in the middle.
We're counting on you, Araki.
Araki-kun.
Araki-san.
If I'm the knight in the area my brother talked about,
that you'll definitely score the goal next time.
Right?
But good work, Enoshima.

I want him to develop into a thoroughbred striker.

Nice shot.

You're both sexy!

You are...
If you underestimate our beach house, you'll regret it!
Let's drink together.
My daughter has such a mouth on her.
Like that. Um... you're?
Kota.
Sorry, Kakeru.
Shizu-san! Those stripes are cute.
Of all the places to run into them...
...good!
The beach house isn't a playground.
I'm counting on y'all.
I really appreciate it.
Sorry it got so late. I'm Nana Mishima.
I'm Mai Murasaki.
She's definitely into you.
But maybe the water's a little too hot.
I get overheated so easily.

Sorry.
Hey, Momoka-san's watching.
Sorry.
Cut it out!
You look great, Kudo.
Is this place going under?
What kind of joke is that?
I'm serious.
How about some cold and delicious shaved ice?
Working. What about you?

It's cold! It's sweet! Give us your money!

Both sides have started making shaved ice.

No, he's taking the lead! Oda's in the lead.

I appreciate your feelings, but I have soccer.
How did you know that Ryoma-chan was my type?
How embarrassing!
And the next morning...
Araki-san and Oda-san's playing felt somehow refreshed.
The soccer club has been busy making fried noodles
and selling shaved ice with their unique staff.
Yusuke...
What ridiculous people.
On top of wealth and foreign students,
They're only here to set the stage

I believe the soccer gods treat everyone equally.
Again. He's staring at me again.

Hey! Leave him to me.
Shukyu's moved their defensive midfielders and fullbacks up.

Don't underestimate Pat's speed.
But the ball had a spin on it.

they came up with this formation play.
Ricardo Vernardi's play is so perfect you have to wonder
That's all from me.
Yes, sir!
About the first point by Kamakura:
I think it was something that Suguru-san said a long time ago.

When the game finally started moving again,
They're one goal ahead,
See? Look. Here comes Ricky.
If we take it back right away, we win the championship.
The closer a game is,
If Kamakura...
Kamakura may have lost,
There isn't much of a difference between

See you on the field!
On the other hand, Mai, who still can't mesh with Nadeshiko Japan,

Will she be able to make it past these defenders?
That's the end of the game.
I know!
Mai-chan?
Thanks for coming to cheer us on yesterday.
We usually just sprint up this,
Sorry, sorry.
Wait a second, Iwaki-chan.
I'm aware that it's absurd,
In other words, to break through that wall,
And what we came up with was...
that inter-high embarrassment again.
Let's go. We've got another 20 to go.
It probably is something like that. Right, Mako-san?
No, no. It might be something even better.
If I've come this far...
You better remember this, too, Araki.

This time it's our turn. Get him!
If they knew the truth,

Yeah.

That's what I think, too.

Kakeru received his brother's heart
That evening, I received an invitation
What was that about?
Really?
It happens every year, so stop getting so excited every time.
Fine by me.
I'll do what I want, of course.
Bring your own ball.
Takajo-san, we're about to start training camp.
Hey, Takajo-san, long time no see.
Hey, Suguru. Pass me a ball.
Thanks.
Hey, Suguru.
Damn it. I suck at physical training.

That's my line.
It doesn't matter how much better they are than us.
Yes!
Dribbling? Planning on taking it in by yourself?

Yes.

Damn. Is this it?
Oh, no. I was incredibly tired.

No way! That makes it even worse!

I'm sorry.
We were careless, as well.
What?
We've lost an amazing player.
Yeah.
I met someone interesting by Suguru's grave.
You're looking well.
I was worried about trauma from the accident
Good thing I'm so thickheaded.
He was just a boy of 15,
on the day of accident,
and the forward who received the pass
I'm sorry.
No, not in particular.
This guy...
My brother?
Hey, Kakeru...
Kakeru?
If Japan is satisfied with a tie,
then I doubt they'll ever bring home the World Cup.
I'm sorry to bother you
Excuse me.

Isn't this Suguru-san's diary?
He's an interesting guy, right?
Full of expectation and hope,

It's just like Coach Sakurai said.
It was a pretty forced shot.
It wasn't that he didn't,
it was that he couldn't.
That's why he couldn't cut back
That's really amazing.
I hope Kakerucchi gets to play soon.
I won't lose, Brother.
Kakeru's not playing yet.
Hurry up and get out here, Kakeru.
The defenders are rushing forward!
It's going to Araki-san!
Kakerucchi!
We're going to get that first goal, Aizawa.
That was close.
What was that?
The first goal.
Huh?
so if you're close to the opponent,
Or will he pass it to Araki-san or Kakeru?
Undoubtedly.
You're a meanie, Coach!
Araki-san.
Now I see again just how amazing the world level is.

I'll definitely do it, Brother.

What a bunch of idiots.
Wait, Oda-kun.
What?
Yeah.
No matter how low you bow, it's impossible.
Right, Sawamura-san?
What?
Aizawa.
However, one day, the Montague family's only son, Romeo,
I'm cut out for directing, not acting.
Hey! What's the big idea?!
Um... Then Juliet comes out onto the balcony and...
What have you guys done?
Sorry!
Oh, my beloved, Romeo-sama.
Then, tomorrow morning at the church.
You pushed all of Nana-chan's work onto everyone else.
Jeez, where did everyone go when we're so busy?
Come!
We'll have to get a substitute.
Let him be. He can't do it.
I'm all right. I can still do it.
Normally, Tybalt is supposed to be killed by Romeo, right?
Your body will appear dead
We've been working without food or drink...
Yeah.
Sorry.
Kakeru?
How long are you going to keep us waiting?
We all got a laugh from seeing
Completely different from a certain plump one.

the FC right side's Mikami will be substituted with...
Yes?
But no matter how tall he may be...
In order to strengthen the defense on the sides,
That's as far as you go, Hino!
Idiot.
That was quite smooth, wasn't it, Coach?
With this, the physically strong Hino-kun
has suddenly taken control of the ball!
You can disappear for minutes.
That was amazing, Kakeru-kun!
Can't you hear? You're subbed!
Thanks to Aizawa's goal, FC has narrowed the gap to one point.

Crap...
Shit. If it comes to this, I'd better foul to stop him!

Still, we gritted our teeth and fought

Not yet! It isn't over yet!
That's why I've endured waiting in the stands.
and rigorous training.
Araki-san, you came for us.
I'd pass it if I could, but I can't get an opening!
We should probably score a goal, first.
3 to 2!
As always, you never know what he's going to do.
Sorry, but I'm so happy.
This time, it's your turn.
It takes two to create a pass
You set the stage.
Okay.
but you're too slow to return.
If they send a pass out, get back immediately, got it?
Takase!
Now that Araki-kun's back,
Unfortunately, the ball rebounds off the goal post!
Number 9, Kakeru Aizawa.
I've got to go with my left!
You can't let your guard down around this man.
That guy gives me the chills.
Yeah...
They scored in the blink of an eye.
every time they took the ball,
can no longer stop their constantly changing attacks.
and stay in possession of the ball.
Think.
Kakeru, take the middle.
Forecheck!
Have they changed strategy?
He's still going.
It's the centerback, Kaiouji!
Araki's killer pass!
It's a tie game, 3 to 3.
They showed us a superb battle today!
So close, Kakeru.

Coach Kondo?
It's the only way I could atone
You got me, Iwaki-kun.
However, this is something that has already been decided
but must think on their own and act.
You must be happy, too, Brother.
Soccer really is fun.
Was it a pretty strong team?
It's... a... secret!

Got it.
Now, in order to pursue the inter-high league as a new team,

For a moment, I wasn't sure what would happen,
Yes. We'd like to borrow the strength of the "little witch."
I understand. Let's go, Director.

When people are having fun,
the muscles relax
Yeah.
Director, please say something!
Now, now, don't take it so seriously.
I can understand why you're upset,
I think so, too.
but the thought that "we have to do something"
When I get home I'm going to drink some juice,
I'm sorry.
Thanks.

Yeah!

I can do that anytime, damn it!
I-I'm nervous.
Th-Thank you.
It's a wise tranny!
It's perfect.
Doesn't this take you back to our youth?
Sitting here, beneath the lush greenery,
Huh... So that's why you're all studying?
Oh, you're going to pay me back, huh?
I'll make sure you'll never be able to run your mouth like that again!
Uh... Well, I guess I'll do it!
It's called "What's Inside This Box?"
That's it. I'm out.
Good.

Where would Karuta like to go for a date?
Yes, maniac.
Well done.

Is this one of Natsume's pranks again?
So, how long are we not supposed to speak?
How long are we not supposed to speak?
Whose prank is this?
Will someone bring me a sheet of paper?
I saw one, not long ago.
There's another one.

That's right... It's me!
The training camp...
However, I couldn't tell Kakeru and the others,
We need another player.
What're we going to do?
But... Nana!
Go! Enoshima Tower!
Fool.
You were amazing in gym today.
Someday, even I...
Ow.

But why didn't she tell us?
I thought I just saw them...
No, no. I've assigned them a separate menu for today.

Still a far cry from major league soccer, but quite a few amazing
I look forward to playing with you again.
Nana-chan!
In America, women's soccer is popular.
On top of that, adults started getting all excited on their own.
Soccer stopped being fun.
So, I...
That's enough.
I'm going to continue as the manager for the club.
Your stinking perfume makes me sick!
We found traces of two bullets... in the chest and in the head.
Mr. Akai...
What a waste of our tax money.
You did it?
l don't want to hold you back.
What are you doing?
Go home and wash it yourself, okay?
You asked Kanie where l worked part-time?
You're Oburi, right?
Yeah, it is.
lt's a very unusual name.
Do you have a family?
You?
l'll tell you.
Why's that?
They look weird, yet really beautiful.
Your place.
This is the third celebrity.
Just die already!
Did he say anything?
A young one.
The result is all that counts!
Are you okay?
Really strong green tea.
lt's an easy job for you.
l know.
He was bribed to ignore the illegal activities of a big corporation.
...is you!
Do it yourself.
You!
Get away from him!
l look better with pencils than with guns.
Did you notice?
Right now, you don't even have the strength to pull the trigger!
Sawa?
Let's go!
Where the hell were you?
Shut up!
How do you like this building?
Is this a cool place or what?
Do you hear me, punk?
Better check those bullet fragments.
Those assholes.
Seems shocked to death.
He's a popular comedian.
His usual material is about corpses.
What a tearjerker.
W-Why would anyone kill him?
That's not like you...
Who are we doing?
You did it?
Right.
...you have to take care of three more jobs.
I knew you'd say that.
Isn't that right?
Give it to me!
Tell me your name.
Oburi.
How much do you know about me?
Nope.
...my guardian.
Shit...
How exciting!
If we're lucky, we'll find something left behind by the suspect.
If you fell from this height, it'd be impossible to identify the body.
Lucky girl.
Did they find out about the chief's Lolita complex or something?
...it's a woman.
Akai.
It's not my fault.
Really strong green tea.
It's bitter...
Sawa...
Be on time tonight.
Akai?
That's right.
Just an ordinary citizen.
You punk! You caused me quite some trouble...
Stop it!
Gross hobby.
His face is weird!
Hey, no hitting. No kicking, either!
That's not
I knew it...
By Yoshizawa-kun and Kamaishi-kun from the next class over.
Your parents work really hard for that money!
But if that'll settle things...
That's not what I asked you.
a6or actually, I just don't feel pain that much.
H-Hey! Hey, hey!
Wait, are you asking me ou
Um, Yamada-sensei. When are we going to resume class?
Ready? And... go!
How about you, Maki-san?
Being trapped in a room with you people is more than enough to catch a thing or two.
Nice.
They're not ones to care about warnings.
What exactly... is all this? her answer doesn't fit the question, though both translations are basically correct as far as i can tell; i hoped to make this line sound neutral enough for it to go both ways
The Imbecile. I'm really pissed off but I don't have the facilities to change it
Be it due to positive feelings or negative feelings.
How boring.
Kacchon!
If we were able to know and share other people's pain and suffering as if our own,
Yes. Katsuhira-kun jumped off the top of the stairs at the school.
Wait, is that true?!
Isn't that wonderful, Katsuhira-kun?
I... can't find myself within me either. A
All this stuff about other people's pain and sharing our thoughts...
I still don't really comprehend the Kizuna System,
but for me to be selected for it is sort of... where ma wixoss bros at
My brain's totally fried.
You're totally right, Maki-san... no, Honoka-chan.
Nico is looking for Zantoman.
Yeah!
Huh?
"One person for everyone's sake, this should clear it up
Then let's make it two buckets of pork soup! i'm as weeb as they come but i don't see a reason to keep tonjiru here, unless it's already made its way into non-japanese cuisine. which i doubt.
And it's somewhat dangerous to eat, isn't it?
Yeah.
I sent her an email, but she didn't reply.
I sure didn't do no tests of courage. you can kill the double negative
What kinda cheesy youth fantasy is that?!
What's the matter, Tenga?
"Halt"? We weren't going anywhere to begin with.
When we all were apart, well... I mean, this summer...
I thought you'd be in school at this hour.
Nori-chan!
Something's... strange.
Where, where?
Nori-chan came out from here.
What? From here?
Did your Kizna react?
She just lost consciousness.
I think she got too worked up.
The pain of five, on their own?!
I don't understand that reasoning at all!
I wouldn't understand even if our pain or feelings were connected.
Even things like those would be multiplied by nineteen and assault Nori-chan's body
many of the other children ended up losing their sense of pain and related feelings.
Their emotions became increasingly diluted, and most of them turned out to be unfit to live among society.
for as long as she could remember.
Connect...
Yeah, it totally did.
The more they felt pain together, the more closely she felt connected to them. important because it sounded like she enjoyed their pain, but not her own
So, did you see it?
Can you get home?
Um...
I thought I'd tell everyone what we saw today...
Remember!
i1but I'm having trouble remembering it.
This whole time, I didn't really care about pain.
Today, I met them...
The backs of my eyes were burning, and I couldn't help but scream.
Splash, splash, splash...
Buzz...
Just as Nori-chan was still a kid when we first met her,
Chidori...
Okay.
I thought about a lot of things, and I might actually be Ise udon. alright, fine
Well, that's because you lack emotions.fuck it yolo
Yet I had forgotten...
What is this?
So...
an8Agata?!
an8Agata!
Think about it, huh?
Feeling someone else's pain as if it were your own...
But I... found Nori-chan too. this is... like the one time it's okay
an8Everyone, I am Sonozaki Noriko.
an8I'm sure you all live each day filled with pain and suffering.
an8Bearing that pain alone is a terribly sad thing,
What's the meaning of this?!
for our hearts and bodies can become one.
Yeah, that ain't happening.
Nori-chan and Yaamada are trying to connect with as many people as possible.
No, that isn't what will happen.
Sorry...
Wh-What's the matter?
Hey! Why am I getting dissed now too?
Could you really empathize with the guy who made your crush cry if you weren't friends with him?
I-I'm not empathizing!
Th-The bridge...
At that place, no one was ever alone.
That's wrong!this is for later
Everyone...
I was certain we had assembled incompatible types of people,
Chidori?
Huh?
I think I would have come to love you now anyway! even if they were never connected, he would have fallen in love with the 17 year old Nori. fuck cr
I do not understand your feelings, nor everyone else's.
If we continue the experiment...
Why do we need to share them? FINALLY someone's asking the right question
And even if everyone's wounds disappear...
And without using the Kizna System!
i1Please give everyone their pain back!
Ow!
an8So is this what it's like to feel pain?
It's pounding, stinging, throbbing...
And it feels so good...
Then I won't have to worry about pests flocking to you.
I... wanted to apologize to you, Tenga-kun.
Huh? Told you what?
What?!
Why are you smiling?
Huh? Was I smiling?
But as their friend, I don't want things to stay awkward between them.
So they're going to turn this facility into a park, huh?
That's just how it works.
I'm doing quite well.
I know. I'm sure we will remain in a pure relationship for a while.
Well, that's rather straightforward.
I take it back, I don't accept you two at all!
To think you'd sell off your precious students...
Yes,
I'm Tenga Hajime. Sugomori High School, Class 2-A.
Yuta Tsuguhito. Sugomori High School, Class 2-A.
Huh?
What?!
Fine! Let's do this thing!
Answer this from deep within your chests:
We might be better off saving Agata first, rather than finding the answers.
Huh?
No!
Tenga-kun is known around the neighborhood as "Mad Dog".
But, as it turns out, he's actually terrified of dogs.
Even going to and from school...
Demolition.
More importantly, are the others safe?
I assume you have followed our conversation.
There's no need to worry.
"Yuta... Tsuguhito..."
I really... don't know.
I believe that's acceptable.
Seriously, what is all this?
Or else...
i1People can't find themselves within you.
I'm... different from all of you.
I can't take any interest at all
in what other people think, to be honest.
What?!
Ever since we started grade school, I couldn't understand you anymore!
Chidori-san!
Ch-Chido
And yet...
Kacchon...
Why did you take that seriously?
If you should complete it, the Kiznaivers will be released. to match
Sounds like a piece of ca
I'm gonna violate her, I swear... I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH HOW CASUAL THIS IS, MARI-CHAN
I don't think I've ever met anyone less qualified to talk about things making sense. gouriteki up in this bitch
Are you shitting me?
I called you without thinking.
Not to mention...
Ow!
You guys aren't hurting anymore?
Wait...
I just figured worrying about someone like me would be bothersome for you. this is one of those amazing things in japanese where there's a grammar specifically to talk yourself down. I actually made this line more generic
Huh?
What are you planning to do?
S-See you girls later...
D-7.
You can hear her from here.
Is Tenga threatening you or something?
Not quite...
Huh? I'm not supposed to talk about it?
More importantly, I keep feeling some slight pangs...
He's in for short-term hospital stays all the time!
He's kinda bruised and battered all the time.
Does that mean someone's bullying him?
So he's a con artist?
Kacchon?
He's really handsome!
i1You're...
Huh?
Why?
So you're really going to help me?
Then...
You can't be shaking if you want to convince us!
an8Poke.
Get a hold of yourself, Hisomu!
Why? We should have all shared the pain equally.
High-and-Mighty, Eccentric Headcase, Musclehead Thug, and finally...
And let us pray that, this time, we will finally be able to obtain
i1You're not the same as us, Katsuhira-kun.
i1"Everyone" is everyone I like!
How could you?!
That's nothing be so casual about!
Then why'd you keep running away from us?
Nico's... Nico's...
Nico's weird too!
Stimulation.
Would it be possible to rephrase that as "the feeling of being alive"?
Like I'd ever do that!
Though if you do have one, make sure to tape and submit it!
Yamada'd totally get his freak on with it. sheet mang
Well...
Exchanging email addresses, huh?
Huh? What are you talking about?
I'm a man that always follows through!
Why fried rice?
Hey, if you have room for soup, start filling up with fried rice!
Sonozaki-san, why don't you come with us to the summer camp?
School counselors starting to patrol and handing out warnings outside of school now?
I have no intention of warning you at all.
Yeah, whatever.
Huh? What's that?
Schnbrunn Palace.
Whoa there, Sonozaki.
Cooking specialist!
Water torture.
Ooh, the dark side! The dark side of society!
a6Nico caught a stag beetle! A stag beetle!
Do you really think that's the only reason?
I don't mind lending you a hand. fuckin learn english cr
S-Stop messing with me!
Ow! Ow, ow!
Word chain.
A summer camp is a place to train both body and soul through living with others.
Hey!
You had free rein making up the teams, so why didn't you put him with you?
You're too heavy, Takashiro-san. now it actually matches
Keep it coming... and stop.
It's fine if you happen to kill him in the process of surprising him.
The tempura wild greens, the simmered potatoes, the fried chicken
Huh?
With a meal this good, I can eat like five more bowls of rice. gohan wa okazu, da yo
Huh?
Huh?
No, I'll make due with these.
since you once said that everyone wants to connect with someone else,
I will. Thanks.
so of course I got fat, what with my diet being entirely snacks.
What would you do if it had a growth that looked like a face on it? pretty gross
Hey, are you talking about your past? sorry ianu
Hey, come on now, you two.
I wouldn't have wanted to kill him if he weren't around!
No... more!
at the stage of the abandoned hospital mission.
an8It's all because I've been friends with that guy since we were kids.
an8We're bound by our pain too.
Why am I the only one suffering so much?
Kacchon felt far worse pain because of you guys! this is a surprisingly complicated line to tl. I changed it to felt because she means emotional pain
Yeah. Why did you suddenly bring up Sonozaki-san? misunderstanding
Shut up, cherry boy.
Hey, did Fukuzawa-san tell you?
I'm never gonna forgive those bastards.
I would like to apologize for that. However, the results we obtained as a result far exceeded our expectations.
Maybe that was the churny feeling I felt in my tummy?
Besides, they're probably soggy by now.
She's the type to get lonely easily.
What do you mean, "friends"?
We've achieved surprising results with the new Kiznaivers.
And finally, the government's growing impatient as well.
I know, right? The story totally makes you cry.
It just doesn't work that way.
We need some buzz to make the movie happen.
Come on.
Don't say that with a straight face.
and "The Promise From Heaven" debuted in a shoujo manga mag.
She even said it during our first mission.
It wasn't a joke?!
Huh?
but putting up with this churny feeling day in day out sucks too.
Hey, what's going on there? Is that a TV crew?
an8No matter how much you try to run...
Th-This isn't good, Atsugi-san.
So this is what it feels like...
What? That wasn't good at all!
Yeah.
You have a frightening look on your face.
But this pain I feel in my heart is very unpleasant.
all of your hearts have been connected on an even deeper level.
Did my actions hurt your buns? I'm sorry for everything
It's strange to me too.
That means we're trying to figure out what's hurting Maki-san?
Enough!
Nico doesn't have any friends.
But still, even then,
What's wrong with all of you?!
Can't you blow your nose here?
Man, this is all so...
i1Hey.
You're like a pro!
Ruru? Hey!
Oh no, Ruru!
That's what Fukuzawa-san said.
Shall we fix that? sync up with sign?
I think...
I can't...
Sorry.
All right!
It is... but I hope it happens.
It hurts that we can't do anything for her if all we know is that she's in pain.
Why don't we just ask her?
Still, we've never actually asked her.
Oh, yeah? THIS IS A JOKE. WARNING. THIS IS A JOKE.
You mean with him too?
See you.
All right! I'm hopping into the tub.
And you always just go along with it!
Friends should be more
Do it!
I met Ruru,
H-Hey, Maki! We're having a blast here with these fireworks!"blast"
Come with me, Takashiro-san!
Maki
Katsuhira,
Yuta,
Me too.
And then they lived happily ever after.
Oh, acting like you can see the future? Good job!
This is crazy.
not even the intense pain and suffering from getting hit in the back of the head compares to it.
Yeah, and what better time than now.
Do you get it now?
I don't want people thinking I'm an idiot too.
Your stickers are ready! changing all to !
Then you shouldn't be so sneaky about it and just do the experiment with your chin out.
The children from back then...
Anyway, that's the end of today's review.
It's no use. I'm not getting any reception.
A p-pompadour?!
My legs are dripping wet.
If we stimulate their romantic feelings,
Romantic feelings...
Maki Honoka still has feelings for the friend she lost, so she's on hold for now.
So you're finally getting into it, you wannabe hottie!
I got you covered!
That boy... He's an enigma. We'll put him on hold too.
Is that so?
The Katsuhira-kun from before had expressed them toward me, as well.
P-Put this on!
What?!
something no something, huh
You're still saying that?
No! I've been holding this back for a long time!
I-I, well... hm... I don't think it's a coincidence she says "sono" here
You exist...
Yes. I was merely somewhat lightheaded.
Will you permit me to ask a question as well?
Hey!
Does that mean I'm in your thoughts all the time?
Wh-What's this about?
There we go! Niiyama Nico with the sick zinger!
Put it like that and it means you're pretty much rejecting this whole experiment.
since the Kizuna Committee gathered children, from early childhood to adolescence, as test subjects.
Weren't you the prime example for that, Urushii?
But this feels different...
No...
I can't breathe, Katsuhira-kun.
So do you, Nori-chan.
Chidori!
I'm sure... that must be the case.
Tell us everything! Now!
N-No!
I had the same suspicion, but...
You told Katsuhira to do the same thing.
Hey, wait!
But...
Is that a voice?
This is fantastic!
Come again?
Why?
We're supposed to be "Best Friends"...
Honoka-chan, what are you...
i1It hurts...
Hey!
should be inside of me too...
Are you all right?
You can clear your mission, everyone.
and a "gi" from "ginkgo tree" too.
Right? Thus we have Araragi Koyomi.
It's no big deal.
You're so easy to chat with.
Friends are just another weakness.
But when your friends have fun, you'd have fun too.
What would I do in a library?
I'm not gonna make it, no matter what I do.
Do you have a cell phone?
Looks like you've just made a friend!
I can get away.
I can get away from this.
No!
Please, I beg you!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Right?
I give it all to you.
Wake up already!
How stupid do you have to be to jump right into the sunlight?
Call me Heart-under-blade.
I believe it was called a cram school.
What is your next question?
I turned into a vampire, right?
Your servant...
but it was insufficient.
Still better than perishing.
This should suffice for now.
That said, do not forget that you are my servant.
Make your replies clear.
That should do.
Why did you turn me into a vampire?
I give you my word if needed.
I have no chance of standing against them now.
Won't I just get slain instead?
Do you want to murder a fellow human?!
Don't be so alarmed.
Your stare's sharp.
Like a barrier?
Not great?
I'm not a fan of it.
Maintaining the balance is my specialty.
It is extremely simple.
Between us and those three?
That much is the least I must ask to maintain the balance.
Firstly, we need to separate them.
I may be weak now, but even I can see that.
but if I get to pay when I can and you don't press me about it,
i1Araragi.i0
Before that, let me confirm one thing.
you shall tell me the whereabouts of Heart-Under-Blade.
Dramaturgy is a vampire.
What in the world
Well then, that's that. See you later.
Also, it doesn't mean "that's great".
You sure do know everything.
Well, truth be told, I was kind of hoping for that to happen.
I'm fed up with you.
I was only pretending to be your friend.
So...
I'll be able to best Dramaturgy.
If you were to slam something like that into me with your strength,
Well, how about this:
the severed arms evaporated.
So I thought that maybe Kiss-shot's limbs had evaporated as well,
That girl is of a precious lineage, Araragi.
Come on now.
You shouldn't doubt her like that.
So it's kind of my fault, isn't it?
That if you speak about them, these oddities will be attracted from the other side.
Why were you doing something like that?
Well, it's not as though I was searching in earnest.
I was stifled by life.
I said before that I wanted to help you, but...
There's probably not much that I can do for you.
More importantly, shouldn't you get changed? Those clothes are in tatters.
Well, but...
No different to a normal human.
But it does feel as though your muscles are more elastic and resilient.
Hanekawa, have you felt
If you could put on your shirt...
Well, to put it bluntly,
he acts out of personal feelings.
No, it's nothing.
Her sides.
So what happens if you mix in dirt?
Hanekawa was!
Not a laughing matter; but a business matter.
Hanekawa.
Close, yet far from the truth.
Haven't you thought about what you're doing?
NNot at all!
You're mistaken about me.
I'm cunning and I think I'm pretty selfish.
Not quite. There's still something you can do.
into a well or a hot spring?
Not at all! I don't know what you're insinuating.
My apologies. I cannot return these.
I can't return your panties,
even if I'm completely useless,
You got that right!
Class Prez has been kidnapped.
What should I do?
I may not possess the supernatural strength your kind is renown for,
We should get started soon.
There's no way I couldn't worry!
You did not save me because I was I.
Please be so kind as to fondle my bare-skinned breasts.
No.
I-I-I have no idea-idea-idea-idea.
T-That's right. I was only paying attention to the lining of your skirt.
Hanekawa-chan.
What? Is it the kind of book you can't show?
A stupid thing to say!
I couldn't allow my soul to be tarnished, you know.
an8 TL Note: You won't know why yet, but this is probably a happy "run in to"
It's unfortunate but, today I only studied Spanish.
Yeah, I'm only at about everyday conversation level.
You know everything don't you.
I don't know everything,
Whoever studied what doesn't really matter, does it.
You said a great thing, Araragi-kun!
That's it, let's think of a way to make society better or something!
this guy here that you're pitying can't bear it any longer!
So,
so definitely,
in my duel with Doramatsurugi as well...
What's wrong? Just going to run away?
Heart-Under-Blade underling!
How's that!?
No, but...
Please spare my life.
What was that?
Then, I had my eyes on your Dakara!
an8TL Note: I think Dakara is a drink created by Suntory, it seems it has mineral components good for the body and comes in sizes from small cans to 2L jugs.
Hey?
He really gave it back.
Yeah, I did think that, but...
So, I thought that it was possible that maybe Kiss-shot's limbs had disappeared as well, but,
why didn't they regenerate or disappear?
I...
Hey, hey, what's with that face?
Did something good happen?
Don't speak like you've seen through me.
You, Araragi-kun.
I felt like I wanted change in my life.
I'm sure you can, definitely.
What's the matter?
I knew it! I thought so yesterday, but
But, it does somewhat feel as though your muscles are more elastic, I guess.
you've touched them before?
No,
Truly,
Oh, not at all! If I were in trouble you'd be the one helping me, wouldn't you!
Umm...
but I absolutely love bullying bad guys!
So I'm a bad guy?
Mist, that's essentially water.
But... But...
Hanekawa-chan...
Like this.
but in my current condition, I could not even defeat Episode.
Guillotine-Cutter, huh...
Completely and purely, he's an ordinary human.
It may be somewhat questionable coming from me, but religious faith can be quite a nuisance,
Well, if I had to say one or the other, it feels like I have no appetite.
Ah, I guess.
to be honest, not being able to hold down my feelings was a big part.
Neglect...
You're...
Honestly, I'm a little taken aback.
I guess it's about time to step down from the role of going shopping.
No, there is something you can do.
I'm looking forward to that from the bottom of my heart.
No, no, no, I didn't say I didn't need them!
What are you deciding on your own!
will become my reason for living from today.
Just what should I do!?
You...!
What do you plan on doing with Hanekawa-chan?
If it's just a single girl,
I can easily kill them.
If they were in a weakened state, you would have helped anyone.
Please fondle my bra-less breasts.
If I win,
Or are there humans who look like that?
Is that you, Araragi-kun?
NNo!
Taking a stroll?
A baseball book?
Nonsense!
Wait, I live pretty far away!
You didn't memorize the right definition.
Shut the fuck up!
Got it.
Merely running away, Heart-Under-Blade's servant?!
But still...
Would you be satisfied if I said this?
I will never lay another hand on you.
Right leg obtained.
Hey...
By the way, Oshino...
Hm? What's up?
it quickly grew back.
That's because Heart-Under-Blade's vampiric immortality
was almost gone by the time you two met.
But...
That's pathetic.
I just meant the possibility increases.
It's not like I was seriously searching.
I'm still grateful.
WWell, um...
It's fine, this is normal.
Chief Dramaturgy got wrecked by a brat like you?
Don't think I'll go easy on you.
Am I a bad guy?
If you wanna say something, spit it out!
Hanekawa! Hanekawa! Hanekawa!!
Araragi-kun, be quiet...
Get it together...
Fog. In other words, water.
this match is over.
But But
Then say so from the beginning!
If you told me...
This isn't time for jokes, Oshino!
Hanekawa...
Unfortunately, I still can't use some of my vampire skills.
I'm just harder to kill than before.
I may be able to handle Dramaturgy
And if the opponent were Guillotinecutter...
nor is he a half-vampire like Episode.
My physical condition was also poor.
In my opinion, this thing called "religion" is nothing but trouble.
You call it a wound,
Now that you're naturally muscular,
you won't get fat no matter how many calories you consume.
It's more like I don't have an appetite anymore.
Like I'd be fine not eating.
We once talked about "humanity."
Hanekawa, I
But you do it like it's normal!
But why would you go so far for me?
It's more than I could hope to bear.
It's not self-sacrifice.
Then what is it?
This isn't a matter of whether or not I want them!
They'll be passed down as an Araragi family heirloom.
I'm currently going commando
with nothing but a thin skirt on,
should be a piece of cake, right?!
What the hell should I
Begin what exactly?
don't worry about me!
then there's no point in being human again!
Araragi-kun,
Die, my master!
PPlease ffondle my braless boobs.
I can let you borrow Kiss-shot's leg.
Sound fair?
Did I fucking stutter?
Many say "meh". Honey, say "huh".
Hm?
You sound like a broken record.
Literally, like a broken record.
You and Jii-chan had a right long look at my panties.
They are pretty cute, I'll give you that.
Hank.
They're Titans and that's it. Anything else is just silly.
Wait up!
Un? Soredemo ningen ka?
how about a Doner kebab?
I'm mostly familiar with Spanish memes and stuff.
And I'll thank you not to loop your misunderstanding of "spasibo" into this.
Does it matter if we studied nani or not?
Okay, then, how can we make society more yoku?
Sony.
Why would you want to meet one of those narcissistic losers?
Are?
You honestly bother me.

It's not like it can't.
The demon of it is that the chances are always wavering.

How do I put it...
But I'd much rather be Nishinoya.
Wish I could pull off a sick Rolling Thunder.
Uh?
Rock.
We'll down a big ol' glass o' Sei.
In contrast to Crunchyroll, rather than because it's a source of income,

So close!
Hank...
Yeah. I saw.
Don't try and drag me into this.
I'll throw in Your Beats!

That being said, I did have my guard down at that time.
These ones have tomato in them.
Holy shit why is there a fire down there.
I'm not confident I could do what you've done.
Placing yourself in such danger,
I don't mean it like that!
It betrays the original Japanese!
I know enough Japanese to know that the TL is off.
There's probably no other group of people on the planet who only think about themselves as much as we do.
Well aren't you the cool cat?

Given that fact, it wasn't all that improbable that she lost her limbs.

And, in doing so, an equilibrium would have been struck.
But I'm not inclined to anymore.
I mean, I've already given you back the heart.

Let me congratulate you once again.
Uh, no.
but ever since I became a vampire and acquired immortality,
That may be,
It must've been rough, eh?
After you're a human again,
do be careful as to avoid any rash decisions.
Oi, what are you on about?
Before I forget, Araragi.
give my regards to Class Prez.
I'd rather become human again as soon as possible.
'Tis understandable.
I suppose the way I phrased it was not quite right.
I suppose...
That I was your second after 400 years.
And that, as well,
is a memento of his.
I just cut you.
That means my skills have not dulled.
I don't think it cut deep enough to require healing.
For an immortal vampire to have died,
he perished before my very eyes.
for the longest time.
Not to mention you called me Kiss-short from the start.
Anything shall suffice.
Make fruitful of the night, dear servant of mine.
If only for a short while, you have been a fine servant.
No...
dear servant,
if I do not eat, I shall perish.
She has continually sated her hunger.

I can't...
That's true for most people.
you just don't understand the extent
But, well,
Looking forward...
You...
I would have probably died a lot earlier.
You just can't go and die!
It's all my fault.
Have you forsaken your humanity?
If you want to talk about selfishness,
aren't you being far more selfish
I mean,
I want to take responsibility.
you'll only add to your sins.
Hanekawa.
I'm a vampire.
So...
I'm not like you.
Sooner or later I'll only be able to view you as something to be eaten.
are you?
If you're that devoted to just anyone, you wouldn't have nearly enough lives to give.
you can't die.
There's no one who can stop
and she'll continuing eating people without batting an eyelash.
conversely, the only one who can put a stop to her?
I will definitely exterminate her.
Well, no.
She has a bust beyond your wildest imagination.
You know what, Hanekawa...
What is this, radio calisthenics?
You won't be mad later?
I'm a chicken! I'm a disappointment! I'm sorry!
I was swayed by your unwavering kindess!
However! My eyes have been opened by your actions!
to be sitting here as I am now?
To be frank, I was ready for it to go past mere breast fondling.
a very embarassing situation
Shoulder?
I will ask this of you:
Live alongside me.
Why did you not leave me to die?
No, that's not right.
is that I pardoned your consumption of people.
But I never even imagined that people would die because of it.
Your kindness was

You did not save me because I was me.
I have forgotten most of my time as a human, however,

However, if you do not put an end to me soon, I shall soon rejuvenate.
Heart-Under-Blade,
In order to for him to become human again?
his killing of you wouldn't return his humanity.
After 500 years of existence, I was terrified of suddenly disappearing.
The thought of no longer existing scared me, frightened me to no end.
I could not bring myself to die for him.
How pathetic for a servant of mine.
I was planning on letting my guard down at an inauspicious juncture and forfeiting my life...
I finally understand everything you were trying to tell me!
She would lose almost all her vampiric skills and characteristics.
No matter how much she hungered, she would be unable to eat any humans.
And, as for you, Araragi, you wouldn't become human either.
and Heart-Under-Blade would be tied to you for the rest of her life.
When I brush my teeth, I don't think my gums can even bleed.
There's no way I'll grow tired of it.

How do you know my name?
Would you happen to be stalking me?
It's just that you seem to prefer being alone, like a hermit or something.
Well, you're right. I've got no friends.
Still, this happened at night.
But when your friends have fun, you'd have fun too.
Friends having fun would make me jealous.
Their happiness would just make me envious.
I need no such thing.
I am about to die.
Can't you get a transfusion or something?
I would die.
She's a vampire!
Are you okay with this?
Every last drop of it.
Was it a dream?
Hey!
Your average vampire would evaporate in an instant.
You are immortal, so you would burn and regenerate, and burn and regenerate forever.
Call me Heart-under-blade.
You are my second.
Not that I need to.
The name you bore once before is meaningless hereafter.
Hold on!
but it was insufficient.
Therefore I took a form I could sustain.
Still better than perishing.
This should suffice for now.
Then as a sign of your obedience, pat my head.
Your blood alone only allows me to regenerate so much.
I was prepared for that question.
You shall face those three and take back my limbs.
Now that I am weakened to a bare minimum,
You're weakened, so I might be stronger than you at this point,
Simply put: it is an easy task.
You got saved on your own,
Did something nice happen to you?
Let's just go home for now, Araragi.
How did it go?
They took you out even at your full power.
Which is why I told you to take them on one by one!
You said we could just lay low, but who knows when they find us he
Not great?
Let me rephrase that.
I'm not a fan of it.
Monsters?
And she's the oddity slayer.
She's a rare kind of vampire who can drain energy from oddities.
Who else?
Shall we hear your exact plan?
and Araragi can get back your limbs.
Thanks for your patronage.

Ye kin of Heart-Under-Blade!

That's right. I was engrossed solely by the inner lining of your skirt.
That's pretty perverted in its own special way.
Such foolishness!
That's too bad. I don't know much Spanish.
I only know what I know.
Eh?
I'm sorry! Did what I say strike a nerve?
I was after your assets!
I understand.
I've grown strong.
You're an exception which proves the rule.
At the very least, please spare my life.
What...
I was pretty far away, so I might be mistaken,
You make it seem like I'm in trouble.
I understand that much.
Horny!
I wouldn't mind making amends.
Well?
But what are you gonna do?
It's not like you can just swap them out.
in order to take ownership of them.
Oshino,
To be talking about the one who saved your life like that,
Did something good happen?
It seems like that saying applies almost perfectly to this situation.
If that were the case,
More importantly, shouldn't you get changed? Those clothes are in tatters.
No different to a normal human...
Hanekawa, have you felt
Looks good.
But what you've done
If there's anything else I can do for you,
He absolutely despises vampires.
but I sure do love beating up bad guys!
Huh? What do you mean by that?
So if he's mist, that means
Hanekawa? Hanekawa!? Hanekawa!
Her sides.
Did something good happen?
Anything else costs extra.
Two million?
Not a laughing matter; but a business matter.
What's the purpose of having an immortal body?
Guillotine-Cutter...
nor a half-vampire like Episode.
Close, yet far from the truth.
That being said, I did have my guard down at that time.
and Episode hunts vampires because of a personal vendetta,
You're getting a bit ahead of yourself.
Don't vampires consume blood as nourishment?
So you don't crave blood at all, or anything like that?
I mean it differently than before.
Neglect...
Well, it's not as though it was my intention to make you do those things!
I don't mean it like that!
You're basically a saint.

That was too close.

Wouldn't you think so?
who was to blame for the death of anime?
I was stifled by prosubs.
But more importantly, aren't you gonna do some typesetting? That release looks pretty torn up.
Yeah, I'm getting there.
I'd do some physical chemistry on that.
No! Not at all! Nothing like that!
That wasn't proper of me.

Come the fuck on!
You're dreaming.
I don't think I could return to fansubbing again if people won't appreciate it.
And it's all the Cartel's fault!
I don't understand.
Please, don't be Kizu!
Either learn Jap in full or shut the fuck up.
How!?!?

You shouldn't be so surprised.

So this is the power of the Ether Supplier that Ernesti was talking about, huh?
The Demon!
I caught you!
But...
The reactor suddenly deteriorates and shuts down.
It's time to go, boss.
Switch to another one?
But the great power is also a double-edged sword.
Well, perhaps.
Oh, right.
I'm coming along for the next battle.
it's a loss to my army not to use a knight like you.
I'm honored.
But it will do no good in my hands.
Yes.
Can you defeat it?
Their basic tactic will be an assault from the air using the drake and their airships.
And then the enemy swarms our undefended homeland.
I'd like to avoid a mass battle.
I see.
Well done, Eleonora.
Do you really think so?
When you get all formal like that...
Ernesti...
with the fate of the country.
You don't know what he'll say to you later.
The drake!
I see.
We managed to modify it into the Jilbaveil in time, huh?
I want to run away.
Let's do this!
And so, I'm sorry,
Now, let the fun begin!
Final Episode: "Heaven  Earth!"
I swear on my robot soul that I won't let that happen!
I won't!
Now! Portside jet thrusters, full power!
We won't let it get away!
Burn them down!
The fortress's drawbridges are moving!
What?
Well done, Commander Cunitz.
Well done, don't you think?
A shining dragon?
Damn it!
A shining dragon!
toys will be helpless as they're destroyed!
God damn it!
Eleonora, let's run away!
Damn it!
Our victory is inevitable!
You sure did a job of wrecking these.
Sorry, boss.
And how you saved Kuschpercha.
Without your endurance,
And Knight Commander,
Okay, I won't hold back!
What are you talking about?
I may need a new script to go with the ones for fluid and heat mechanics!
It'll be sunset before that silver-haired boy is done talking about his dreams.
Ernie, stop looking at your dreams and look at what's around you.
The people gained a new way to move from place to place,
and a new era came about,
He's a huge otaku, though.
He's got a two-room apartment,
He's such an efficient programmer!
We'll handle this!
can I pilot a Silhouette Knight?
For him, everything he learned was something
Don't be in such a hurry!
A girl?
Wait, are you training up here?
This was Ernesti's first meeting with Archid and Adeltrud, his future lifelong friends.
That was magic, right?
Uh oh.
Haha! Come and get us!
Some of them seem to be show-offs, though.
What is it, Echevalier?
would I be excused from Magical Fundamentals?
There's another class during this period I want to take.
I know.
Very well.
It's weird.
spread throughout the whole academy by the end of the day.
Without understanding it,
What a boring trip.
Your group's already finished eating?
Don't get so scared.
I didn't say anything until now,
a marquis named Joachim Selati.
Plan?
Thank you, Ernie!
Glad to hear it, partner.
Every family needs one.
Do you like Silhouette Knights, too?
I can't wait to get a partner of my own.
I don't mean to pilot it.
I figured you wouldn't be able to reach the stirrup.
High school students, advance in your Silhouette Knights,
Wasn't this supposed to be safe?
Leave this to us!
Riot Sparrow!
Middle school students, get to safety!
I'm fine.
there are still less than 100 of us.
What?
Gather up all the surrounding Knight Runners in the vicinity.
Move! Move!
I didn't... just leave them all to die.
I'll come straight out and ask.
Damn it!
I can't toss you out into the forest.
Now then...
Now then, time to show what I can do as a programmer!
Identifying similar spells.
Modularizing and linking.
by using his Gunlike Rod to directly input the scripts.
Modify, modify, modify...
I'm in the middle of a fight right now.
Now I can fight for a little longer.
Spread out!
What? Since when do Silhouette Knights move like that?!
It's not going to go down so easily, is it?
Unforgivable.
Stop it! You're crazy!
I see.
Looks like the Guair is at its limit.
Do it if you don't want to die, okay?
Forgive me, Dietrich.
If anything, I feel sorry for Dietrich right now.
Twelve years old?
so we've kept it a secret.
A power that is too great can bring about destruction.
It's a dangerous thing.
Yes, I am a boy.
I want to know how to create the heart of a Silhouette Knight, the Ether Reactor!
You're correct to assume that none but I could grant that wish of yours.
If you'd asked for that instead of the reactor,
No, that's not what I meant.
But slaying a mere behemoth is not enough to justify access to our nation's greatest treasure.
It seems you're all doing well.
This thing's Crystal Tissue was replaced just last month.
What did you do to wreck it in a single night like this?
It's so beautiful.
did the calculations myself,
And as a result, it couldn't maintain the enhancement magic that holds it together.
Is that correct, Guair's Knight Runner?
What are you talking about?
So you're saying that if you're using your full strength,
You idiot!
Let's put them in all the units currently under repair.
There you are.
Silhouette Knights only have two arms, right?
it needs to hold its rod in its hand.
I think it's inefficient to have to switch between sword and rod.
But for an experienced Knight Runner, that's a simple matter.
All the Knight Runner has to do is aim and fire at the right time.
With some training,
Then knowing you, you're going to fight the demon beasts again, right?
And I've come up with the perfect plan, too!
The new Crystal Tissue is safe,
We're gonna have to reconsider the whole mechanical balance.
All Ernie will look at is big, hard, cold things!
Is there no way you can at least put a Magius Engine it?
No amount of training is wasted!
Our big goal today is to check those.
Retracting sub-arms.
Looking good!
Isn't it more amazing if you just used the magic yourself?
Hmm... It won't just help with long-range combat,
but eventually we may have to face it.
So that's what this fight is about?
He stopped the attack with his blade?
Go cheer up Helvi.
There's more?
But altering the Ether Reactor, which gives it the mana,
We'd need to increase the amount of Crystal Tissue,
Okay, on to the next improvement!
He wasn't planning on using them for anything, huh?
Meanwhile, the plan to increase the amount of Crystal Tissue had encountered problems.
Maybe some kind of external pack?
Sheesh! What a selfish machine.
That's what it's going to take to shock the king.
This is for Marquis Dixgard.
What are you doing?
I've never seen a shaker worm like that!
Helvi! Dietrich! We'll use quad-link mode!
Your problem is that you're trying to do things by force.
I haven't hugged him for a week!
The predecessor to the current Kaldatoah was the Salodreah.
What's going on here?
I'm honored to see you again, Marquis Dixgard.
And so by utilizing this newly-created Strand-Type Crystal Tissue,
As I said before,
And I still think there're improvements to be made in terms of production cost.
This concludes my explanation of the new unit
Your future!
I don't understand.
Stop lying to me!
but I'll do it anyway!
no, since the dawn of history,
Why are you even trying to act like a normal child?
but another...
I'd be more worried about the marquis.
What are you talking about?
- Several Days Later -
I've got my Silhouette Gear!
The Earlcumber is a good machine,
Once the overhaul's done, it won't be staying here.
that this was part of a world-shaking event.
What?
The students of the Laihiala Academy of Knight Runners
Thank you, Ernie.
And you too, Kid and Addy.
As long as you're around, Ernie, I can keep fighting!
What?
What if the demon beasts that attacked us were, for example,
Edgar, do you know what you're saying?
That's a division-class demon beast!
Ernie?
If I'd stayed there, I just would've been killed!
You ran away, didn't you?
So isn't it smarter to choose the path where you survive?
And the input and output power of the Ether Reactor.
Modify, modify, modify...
No way.
Helvi!
I found you!
But how about this?
Here I come!
Even magic doesn't work!
Wow, that barely even scratched it!
In Ernie's new world,
Use that weapon!
I tried to conserve as much mana as I could,
I need to at least take out a leg or something,
Charge!
We're going to die! We're going to die!
What's going on?
I see.
but there are still more things I can do!
The lightning fired directly into the behemoth's eye traveled along its optic nerve
Damage report!
If anything, I feel sorry for Dietrich right now.
Twelve years old?
I suppose I must meet this child.
It's a disappointment!
And it's got the greatest firepower of anything at the academy.
Good work!
We can't play together if we don't bring Ernie's!
Welcome back!
Destroy them!
Get the other Silhouette Knights out here!
If you get cocky, you'll run out of mana fast.
So the boss is here, huh?
So this is the power of the new unit?
We see that you are Knight Runners from Fort Casadesus!
Let's hear what you have to say for yourselves!
Let's take them down fast!
That's not how you use the back weapons!
Well done!
What else?
Turn back!
No, mechs must be challenged with mechs.
What's going on here?
If the two of them are still in combat,
Don't you dare get close to it!
What's wrong?
Not good!
Prepare to die!
I had no idea you'd set a trap like that!
Y-Yeah...
As an apology, I'll show you how strong I can be!
No...
I'm curious where the stolen Silhouette Knight went.
summoned to Schreiber Castle.
A good name.
The Earlcumber and I will get it back.
I'll be waiting.
That tickles!
You're so slow!
How long can it take to analyze?
But this Strand-Type Crystal Tissue,
They're different from anything we've ever seen.
It would be even better if you were to give me your analysis of it, Chief Gaizka.
He sucks up to the king and now thinks he's the cock of the walk!
The Occident is the name given to the countries to the west of Fremmevilla,
It's probably the work of someone who forgot that.
Regardless of who it was, we must respond.
I promise I will, sire!
Now, what else does that little boy have in store for us?
Yes, that's right.
I wasn't really thinking about it when I agreed,
You're all here, right, everyone?
How's Bat using a Gear?
That's the selling point for this new Silhouette Gear!
A miniaturized Magius Engine?
The government!
Received.
Well, there's definitely no backing out now.
But it's time for us to fulfill our duty.
but that's not all.
The message from him I just received said this...
There're lots more!
Yes.
drastically speeding up the work of the Order of the Silver Phoenix.
I can't believe I won't be able to enjoy this softness anymore.
So never change!
I'm gonna put your asses to work straight away!
have been handed over to the Order of the Silver Phoenix by order of the king!
So you're...
Have there been any developments in the case?
Okay, it's all attached.
Ernie!
The mech stopped!
It really is too dangerous, I think.
Why?
Got it?!
Oh, wow!
Ernie's so cute when he's sad!
It's fine.
It's a great opportunity to wipe the sweat off, too!
It's paired with the Emblem Graph inside the depression.
That's right!
How strong they look!
making it mobile, easy to control, and powerful!
I see once more that the Silhouette Knight Laboratory's reputation
This is our latest prototype, the Tzendolg,
brought their new mech, the Tzendolg,
The Silhouette Knight is shaped like a horse and rider.
I think his majesty wants to see the fight more than anybody.
That's for humans, right?
There are three of us and one of it!
Wow!
There's one!
Here we go, Tzen!
Lightning Flail!
Rip them apart, Guair.
The Aruvans are living up to their reputation!
Now I'm getting serious!
What's his name?
No, it wasn't the machine's fault I lost.
No idea.
And what was that metal thing the white one fired?
I still won't let you beat me!
While I was away for a bit,
It's all right.
I've been king of this kingdom for 36 years.
A lot happened,
but we graduated from middle school, huh?
so I needed to be home.
You already have a wonderful unit named the Reidis ol Vila.
Right.
A muscle-brain?
I want something that looks super-strong,
I'll leave it to you.
Do as you like, as long as it's not too unbalanced.
Ernie looks so happy.
As you requested, they're both very powerful,
but their defense is strong, as well.
A golden lion and a silver tiger!
I'll show you what I learned in Kuschpercha!
I knew they were muscle-brains.
It must've been difficult for you, huh?
There's no opening for me to attack.
Splendid work, Grandson.
The only difference is their appearance.
Grandpa, I'm going to do this!
A whispering evil lies upon the forest.
Next Time: "Secret  Quest!"
On that day, there was an announcement at Schreiber Castle
Shellcased...
they have a single queen shellcase in the horde which does the breeding.
Wait, my mana pool's almost out!
The new white and crimson mechs are Dietrich and Edgar, huh?
Don't be stupid, Kid!
Did you get her?
He did, he did! Ernie wins!
The ambassador?
Thank you for saving Alfheim.
I don't care!
try it all,
And if it still doesn't work,
Why do the Alvs live in a secret village like this?
but after 200 or 300 years of life,
But Ambrosius, you've grown very old.
I've heard the report.
It was part of our laws.
I'm Ernesti Echevalier!
you will not reach our heights.
Don't decide that so quickly.
Then what should I tell you first?
But under certain special conditions,
And there are two things needed for that.
What's needed is an incantation to carve the pulse of life into the reactor.
It's hard, isn't it?
That is why only the Alvs can create an Ether Reactor.
How is the power of the reactor determined?
you'd use something else, right?
Strange. So do I.
The victories were yours to begin with.
Right!
Hey!
And so Ernesti returned to Fort Orobesius,
and at last began to work on his dream of his own Silhouette Knight.
A disturbing rumor is being spread among the Occidents.
Understood.
Farewell.
When you want to talk to Ernie, you should go through his aides, me or Kid.
Keep it a secret, okay?
Valiant Black Knights, the pride of the Kingdom of Zaloudek,
On this day, Carlitos Bilt Zaloudek,
something happened in Zaloudek.
That makes me relieved to hear.
What is this firepower?
But the war took an unexpected turn.
Like pigs with their rears sliced open!
Now Kuschpercha is finished.
I will fulfill my last duty as king.
Even if it costs my life.
I am the King of Kuschpercha!
Let Uncle do it
Splendidly done, Prince of Zaloudek.
King of Kuschpercha,
Farewell.
It's because of those ships from Zaloudek.
What is it?
Name yourselves.
and Duke Fernando is dead.
A long-range battle!
I can see the secret of the enemy's strength.
You're talking about Silhouette Knights, right?
As you guessed, the technology used in this mech is the same as ours.
So the thieves from the Casadesus Incident were connected to Zaloudek?
Sure am.
will work on our business and getting information.
What's our business?
How are you doing, former Princess of Kuschpercha?
Do you think you get to choose?
you're not calling off the wedding?
I can't ruin the plan my sister came up with.
Thanks to reports from Nora of the Order of the Azure Hawk,
I'll teach him a lesson!
What're those horse-like things?
I, Gustav Mardonnes, will destroy them.
Prepare for long-range combat!
I'm sending out the Silhouette Knights.
We'll finish this with swords.
What's with all the swords?!
Only natural, huh?
Time to finish this, I guess?
If you think Company 3's mission is only transport,
You...
Flying ships, huh?
Couldn't say.
Next time: "War  Princess."
Okay, everyone,
Thanks.
That's awesome.
Understood.
Now it's a race against time.
Right!
Ernesti Echevalier.
Hey, what was that sound?!
This could get a little rough,
Right!
The Order of the Silver Phoenix has arrived! Er...
Let's get out of here and defeat Zaloudek!
You have the power to drive people to action!
From now on, you have us.
Trust me!
Now let's get out of here.
Looks things like are getting interesting, don't you think?
If they're involved,
It'll be because of something else.
This can't be the work of those Kuschperchan weaklings.
I'm afraid it was no one so easy to deal with.
I saw it myself.
It was quite... upsetting.
I'll wipe her and the royal family out!
Your Highness!
You're safe, then.
is a great mech which you can learn a lot from,
you want something in exchange, right?
We won!
Give me a plan.
As a fellow lady, let's ask Helvi's opinion.
That's right.
I came to cheer you up, actually.
Let's go outside!
Um...
Listen, get this ready by morning!
No, I don't even care if she's alive anymore.
They're using the ridiculous alias "Silver Phoenix Merchant Association,"
I'll be using the Vendobadahla Custom.
Did you think it would work twice?
You're in the way!
Aldirat, show me your power!
I regret that...
Well done, knights.
You found the princess?
Yes, sir!
Heave-ho!
Ernie's going nuts.
We've lost Ship 2 and Ship 3!
Contact the Order of the Black Jaw on the ground!
What's going on?
The demon?!
Our allies are... um...
Damn the Reaper...
Turn and follow the flagship!
Blow engines 7 and 11 are damaged!
Back weapons and close-quarters combat gear.
Shut up!
I'll give you whatever you want!
What kind of joke is that?
No, it's not a joke.
If you do, I won't kill you.
What splendid resolve.
Sir Knight?
Yup!
Cristobal... is dead?
I regret it so much!
To avenge Prince Cristobal,
sent a shock wave through Zaloudek's armies.
Glory to Kuschpercha!
I cannot run if I want to keep the people safe.
Queen Eleonora, I'll protect you to the end.
So, silver-haired boy, did you learn anything?
It probably needs a huge amount of ether to operate.
Perfect timing, Ernie.
That's perfectly fine.
No, you're lying.
Yeah.
The Kuschperchan knights are getting better.
No need to worry.
There was no need for me to do anything, though.
I'm surprised Zaloudek was making such a thing.
With the power of this Vyver, we will avenge the prince!
Addy, leave this to us.
What?!
Concentrate!
I'll go pick them up once I defeat you!
So this is the power of the Ether Supplier that Ernesti was talking about, huh?
You're wide open!
Wh-What the?!
Truly a powerful weapon...
how will you fight it?
Damn it!
This is what they call an emergency!
The Order of the Silver Phoenix is retreating?
What are you doing?
What will you do?
Just as knights speak with their swords,
engineers speak with their engineering.
it's a loss to my army not to use a knight like you.
The royal family's Silhouette Knight,
Brother Carlitos sent it from home.
There's a report that reinforcements have arrived from the enemy homeland.
But then...
So we attack with all forces...
I didn't think of that!
Before we lose the lives of any more knights, no, people,
and we are still in danger.
Stop it, Isadola.
The resistance is greater than expected.
What are you talking about, Batson?
but we're the engines, so we can't move.
My Vyver and your demon...
Let's find out, Oratio Gojass.
Now, let the fun begin!
Let's finish this, Oratio Gojass.
Welcome, Ernesti Echevalier!
Ankyurosa, shoot it down!
Run away!
Ernesti's plan...
Awaken, Bespiari!
I shall put an end to this with my own hands!
Roger!
Activating the Blood Grail!
A Silhouette Knight equipped with multiple swords...
I won't let you get away with this any more!
It's just wearing the overflowing mana like a cloak!
Like a moth to the flame...
Welcome, Ernesti Echevalier!
That power!
A Levitate Ship...
toys will be helpless as they're destroyed!
I don't care!
I'll give you credit, white unit.
You did great, my partner!
In terms of the physical end product,
I'll give you credit, Ernesti Echevalier.
I don't even have the mana left to breath fire,
Eleonora, let's run away!
The queen must not flee from the enemy.
Queen Eleonora!
No...
Does that idiot have a death wish?
Gustav, I leave the rest to you!
The enemy drake...
The Vyver fell!
Our victory is inevitable!
as Shilda Neryaku fell.
Get that stuff loaded!
That's obvious.
but I'm leaving in a Levitate Ship.
If Kid was a Silhouette Knight, I'd be rewriting his script!
Let me stay like this for just a moment.
After that, I'll go back to being a queen.
you're going to be learning more about my theories soon, too.
Ernie, I'm cold, so let's go inside!
Especially you Knight Runners.
Without your endurance,
What are you talking about?
For that, I must re-examine the fundamentals of the Crystal Tissue and Ether Reactor!
Ernie, stop looking at your dreams and look at what's around you.
But I think I am...
Robots are a man's romance!
Thank you, Your Majesty.
He does seem quite composed for a boy who's not even in his teens yet.
What do I want?
or ask for something?
Then I ask for this.
That's one of the country's greatest treasures and best-kept secrets!
your wish may have been granted.
It's my hobby!
I will grant your wish!
What is this?
This is true, refined beauty!
It's beautiful.
Let's get back on topic.
Your dreams?
Yeah, it's a mess, isn't it?
Right!
That's part of the reason we're capable of operating them.
For convenience, let's call the rod the back arms are holding the "back weapon."
With some training,
Th-That's true.
The majority of our Silhouette Knights are being repaired right now.
Us?
these Silhouette Gears aren't bad.
You're working hard, huh?
Of course.
was finally ready for its test run!
I didn't realize you could use Silhouette Gears like that.
but eventually we may have to face it.
That's right.
Sounds scary.
Don't tell me you're quitting now!
To your positions!
Helvi's pushing really hard, isn't she?
That's just like you, Edgar!
the new Telestale has passed its trials.
Hey, Ernie.
Yes?
isn't trod in a day!
We'd need to increase the amount of Crystal Tissue,
If we're interested in mana storage capacity,
But having you tell me that is very frustrating, Addy.
This is a weapon called a Scorpius,
Amazing!
Meanwhile, the plan to increase the amount of Crystal Tissue had encountered problems.
Sheesh! What a selfish machine.
The Telestale is a foundation, you could say.
But I should pass on some form of report.
That's right!
I am the commander, Morten Fredholm.
And so we'd like you to send all of these new units to Fort Casadesus,
You want them anyway?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
That's impossible!
What are you doing?
I've never seen a shaker worm like that!
These demon beasts lurk in the ground.
Fire!
Tch!
Edgar?
He and the Telestale stayed behind with Marquis Dixgard.
We must treat them appropriately.
Compared to that, Ernesti Echevalier spent far too little time.
I'm honored to see you again, Marquis Dixgard.
About the new unit.
In other words,
Honor. Position. Rewards.
I'm still only a first-year student at the Knight Runner middle school.
but I'll do it anyway!
Ever since the founding of Fremmevilla,
Look at that!
Another?
Of course?
How could I aim for anything but my best?
All right, moving on...
Shaggy-head!
but you were whining about losing the Telestale too, weren't you?
Which means we need to send the new unit to Fort Casadesus.
It's a disappointment!
so it's a good deal for us.
Why me?
a6The company of Scarlet Rabbit knights that arrived in Darie Village
After sending a Kaldatoah to the fortress as a messenger,
Right!
No lagging!
Boss, there they are!
The new units are being stolen?
Marquis Dixgard, there's no time to waste.
and capture the attackers!
Stop them here!
Open the way!
Edgar and the others going to Fort Casadesus encountered Kerhilt's gang as they fled.
Shut up, kid.
Listen, it's just two of them, and they aren't even out of school!
You idiot!
Shut up!
What else?
Kamasa!
And you really think you'll be okay by yourself?
I'm so jealou
I can't see!
We have a ways to go before we get to the Vendobadahla.
Roger!
This is seriously not good!
I had no idea you'd set a trap like that!
We can't let them have the Telestale!
Run?
Where is our fleeing prey, the Telestale?
Students!
There's one other strange thing.
Impossible!
Splendid work on the new Silhouette Knight.
I think so, too.
What?
I promise you one thing.
Next time: "Trial and Error."
Ernie's so soft...
Ernie...
They're different from anything we've ever seen.
Knut, I'm putting you in command of the Order of the Azure Hawk.
Atone for your failure at Fort Casadesus.
I promise I will, sire!
No, wait...
That's wonderful.
Yes.
That's not true!
How's Bat using a Gear?
That's the selling point for this new Silhouette Gear!
Where the hell did you get that?
Yeah.
Big news! Big news!
What?
A worthy opponent!
Isn't this...
Let's take it one at a time, right?
Yes.
The new unit and the Option Works are all stepping stones toward that.
So never change!
And this is our commander, Ernesti Echevalier.
So small...
On paper, I'm a new student here at the school.
They were in there a while.
Maybe Ernie likes cool women like that?
You three, observe and take measurements!
Ernie!
It's a miracle that all that did was knock you out.
We learned how much power it can output!
and put in a control system that lets you adjust it for certain situations.
So I'm splitting the control systems in two,
Addy!
It was only temporarily attached, after all.
I see.
Edgar, can I have a word?
Correct!
Order of the Silver Phoenix, we're off to the capital!
And now, everyone,
The ones who, by my order, formed a new knightly order!
Enter, Order of the Silver Phoenix!
What are these footsteps?
This is...
Next time: "New  Old!"
Look at that, Tuva.
He looks like a child to me...
We'll handle it just like a demon beast!
Deploying from stored position.
The Silhouette Knight...
...is flying?
Silhouette Knights flying at the speed of a magic bullet?
Now there are just two for us to take!
Here we go, Tzen!
And when that happens,
I'll catch them off guard by launching a preemptive attack on the unit heading for the Tzendolg.
I have a powerful shield named Edgar!
So he's more powerful?
The lab's machines are steady and firm,
If they were horses, they would be a swift horse and a bucking bronco, I suppose.
Philia, it's coming!
What?
And I'm so close!
An interesting guy!
Next time, I want to fight you in the same mech you're using.
No, it wasn't the machine's fault I lost.
We took out two!
Yes! Wonderful, you two!
Two?
Sorry, I didn't get that at all.
and I got a little passionate.
Sheesh, what was Martina doing?
Maybe they're just glad to be rid of us.
so I needed to be home.
You already have a wonderful unit named the Reidis ol Vila.
Of course.
What do you think?
Both of you are very important to Fremmevilla.
And you're far too inexperienced to call yourself a lion.
If you're a sheep inside,
I'll show you what I learned in Kuschpercha!
He was probably a first class Knight Runner, too.
It seems you trained hard in Kuschpercha, huh?
It looks hot in there...
A huge horde of shellcased is heading for Alfheim.
If that place is wiped out...
Allen! Tod!
There're too many of the damn things!
Here we go, Kid!
Ernesti, leave this to us.
You find the queen.
The new unit's name, Guairlinde, isn't just for show!
We'll concentrate our attacks on the legs!
even a queen!
Did you get her?
They're already having us run around, and we just got here.
Because...
I'll just give up!
But first, I need to hear everything!
which is, "Because only the Alvs can do that."
It was part of our laws.
I shall grant all the knowledge of the Alvs you desire.
And so we use this mythril,
The size of the catalyst crystal
we use catalyst crystals that were mined,
Ambrosius told the Order of the Silver Phoenix, but...
Ernie!
and at last began to work on his dream of his own Silhouette Knight.
The two of you, um...
Earlier, too...
Ernie!
Addy, I'm sorry,
Primary converter reactor "Queen's Coronet"
Awaken, my partner!
The time has come to return everything to one greater all!
the eldest son of Bardomelow, King of Zaloudek,
But they're moving too fast!
My servants told me a war might be starting.
We'll send those invaders packing!
A king cannot run and leave his people behind.
I'm heading out!
Prepare the king's mech!
Eleonora?
No!
You are the heir to the throne of Kuschpercha, Eleonora!
then you're still alive!
And you want to stay alive!
Zaloudek...
Now end it!
Farewell.
What is it?
We're searching you and your cargo!
My old man's bad feeling was right.
The party's starting!
Back weapons!
This sounds fun!
If she'd only fight back, I could have fun punishing her!
I can't ruin the plan my sister came up with.
Unforgivable!
What're those horse-like things?
I, Gustav Mardonnes, will destroy them.
They're not scared by the Levitate Ships, huh?
We'll finish this with swords.
I see.
You'll pay for that!
It was the perfect time to leave, right?
Damn!
Well done, Tanikaze.
If use Morito automatable format 181 may just like the pilot with training alone.
Ochiai-sama.
Eh?
It is here.
Nothing to complain?
No.
The Gauna...
Each time you I see a Gauna...
I'll call the others.
Nagate, you're the admiration of rookie pilot.
What is here is NN.
What do you mean?
Do not tell me they're going to dissect or something....
But should not think about that.
Until recently the government called him all the time.
But now do not call.
Sorry.
He there were prepared food.
Yuhata told me he wants to talk about one thing on the specimen Ena.
gave me directions to this specimen.
Yuhata let me use it.
It is one body.
We have not yet sent the information to pilots.
What is that power?
Other units will support.
Why?
Ena recovery is faster than I thought.
Tanikaze!
Prepare units waiting, all loaded ammunition against Gauna.
It is 10 times faster than a normal Morito.
Knights of Sidonia
He raided the rice factory, right?
Then let's go see if it's true or not.
And here you are just...
What?
The patient- The rice thief has escaped!
Throw down our weapons!
You young'uns must listen to me.
You should really thank her.
Thank you, sir.
I-I'm Nagate Tanikaze.
I thought there was something special about you since you were accepted so quickly.
What? No!
Mark 18?
Actually, not anymore.
If I had a Mark 17...
I guess people underground do cleanup a little differently from us.
We've confirmed the presence of ice on a nearby asteroid.
It doesn't matter.
MY Tsugumori?
Sidonia?
Heavy damage to Yamano.
Wh-what's this for?
We might engage in a clutch formation together, so let's shake hands to be safe.
Attention all cadets.
Understood.
En!
We won't be rescuing Tanikaze.
Thirty seconds until the heavy mass cannon fire reaches the target!
Forget it, Tanikaze. Get out of there!
The heavy mass cannon fire, direct hit to target.
We've only pushed it away from us.
The Gauna Cluster is within three light years of Sidonia,
The only way to protect humanity is with unconditional force.
Party poopers.
They resorted to genetic manipulation to survive the crisis.
The newbie piloted the Tsugumori?
Huh? Your nose was broken, too?
I'm about to go leave some flowers in front of Yamano's memorial.
It's better than letting her suffer.
It's okay.
Y-yeah.
It only took two Gaunas breaking through to almost entirely destroy Sidonia.
I guess the Tsugumori suits you best.
Just hold on, all right?
Yes, sir.
Just as I thought, you have a slight case of malnutrition.
Yes! I'll do it.
And so that's why I'm okay now.
And Representative Kunato?
Yeah, that's definitely Akai.
Oh, yeah. It's almost time for the Gravity Festival.
Maybe I'll ask Nagate if he wants to go.
Hey, look. It's Akai and the others.
There he is!
Yeah.
Do you have a second?
What? That's great.
What's wrong?
Our time is counting down to zero, faster and faster.
Oh, actually no. The Captain wanted to see me.
How many cores are there?
We're estimating approximately 200 cores.
It's 20 times the length and over 8,000 times the size of Sidonia.
You are advised to identify the locations of the nearest safety rails
How is Ena Hoshijiro doing?
It's true that the Gauna are drawn to the Kabizashi.
Keep an eye on our subject during the battle.
Switching to cruise control.
Warning
But according to past combat logs, whenever an IPM is used against the Gauna,
Aligning trajectory.
The Garde squads must destroy Gauna 542 before the IPM impacts the asteroid.
Now, once again, Sidonia is facing grave danger.
They have updated the recoil control system from before.
What the hell is this? How are we supposed to fight this?
We're getting a report from the Garde squads!
All units, don't break formation!
I'm taking fire! I can't see anything! I need help!
It's over 35.
I think we have enough core-penetration rounds left!
The Crimson Hawkmoth!
Units 082 and 123 lost!
Another eight units lost!
We've lost all communication with squad two units!
IPM making final trajectory adjustments.
there's a chance we can rip a hole in its Ena!
Affirmative!
Use emergency protocol to close the mainline Heigus circuits
The residential district will experience blackouts
and we will perform an emergency shutdown of the gravity generator.
That is foolish.
Fire.
Incoming shockwave.
Communication loss from the Heigus particle interference surpasses our estimates.
The Tsugumori has been re-equipped with a prototype Heigus engine on the propulsion system.
Yeah, and that's the reason I go alone.
The Ena is regenerating.
Nagate.
We're trying to restore power through the temporary pathway we set up for the Heigus cannon.
Watch for the tentacles!
Fifteen minutes until impact. Hurry.
Tanikaze! Do you copy? Tanikaze!
Shinatose's unit is gaining altitude.
The host core is beyond that wall.
I see it!
The Crimson Hawkmoth's Ena has fully regenerated.
Hoshijiro. Enemy craft down.
Except if we don't do anything, we all die.
I'm so close.
Take this!
Gauna 542 disintegration confirmed.
Projectile has made impact.
If you didn't save me when I was...
Hold on. We had plans to have dinner with Yuhata, remember?
We had even made reservations.
but I know that there's still a lot for us to learn.
It was a perilous task from which 38 of the 48 Garde units would not return.
But the ten surviving pilots won't be the only ones Sidonia remembers as heroes.
Oh, Kunato!
You're quitting the Garde program?
I really do love all the people living here in Sidonia.
Hoshijiro's death is your responsibility.
Yamano's frame, severe damage!
Tanikaze's frame, moderate damage!
You're in the same squad with us, right?
Congratulations, Eiko-chan!
You've achieved so much, starting from our little town!
It'll insert itself on its own, but try not to pull it out.so don't fight it.
Wait.
Tanikaze Nagate has suffered severe injuries to his cervical vertebrae and more.
Abort Tanikaze's rescue.
Impossible!
Pull out, Tanikaze!
Who can tell me when mankind started to photosynthetize?
About one hundred years ago.
That is what led to human photosynthesis.
It's a bit more than that for one of us here!
We're in class!
Shut up!
They let a new recruit have Tsugumori?
Nagate!
Tanikaze used his high speed pulseblade and 30 of his rapid fire ammo.
You all right, Nagate?
Is that a funeral?
It is your job to fight it.
Got it?
What are you talking about?
I figured it might be malnutrition.
Did you call me?
From the food and puking.From the food and throwing up.
Did he leave already?
Akai-san's squad is at the academy!
You'll be the youngest champion in history!
Yuhata?
You're in the same squad with us, right?
You've achieved so much, starting from our little town!
You're doing great, Nagate!
Yamano's armor is failing!
What's Tanikaze's status?
You can't destroy the core without a Kabizashi!
There are no Gauna!
Hey, Shinatose.
Oh, come on.
This allows us to only have to eat once a week.
We're in class!
You aren't wearing your safety belt!
I guess you need to learn about safety belts from the ground up.
Huh? Was your nose also injured?
Honoka Hou and Shinatose used all their spherical explosive ammo.
Impressive!
It's not working.
Neither where they come from nor why they are attacking us.
A mere two Gauna managed to slip through, and they almost destroyed Sidonia completely.
Yes. You go to the biothermal reactor when you approach the end of your lifespan.
That information was not made public.
Allow me introduce them.
I'd seen it a thousand times in the VR simulator underground.
"Yes, I'll do it."
There!
Can we have a moment?
We have some questions for you.We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Judging from the frame's damage, he was in close combat.
With its propulsion system, it will take it about three days to reach Sidonia.
It is your job to fight it.
Yes, sir!
They're all eating at the Gravity Festival.
Midorikawa-san is doing great too.
i1but complicated actions still require an actual person.
Hey, Yuhata! We're in the middle of something here!
Don't pay any attention to her.
Yes.
The cast is the problem.
but they won't let me take it off.
O-Okay.
Well, that's why I want to talk to him and learn more!
Not enough!
Will one of them win by then?
Strike!
Is that a trainees' operation plan?
Yes, ma'am!
What's wrong?
Are you okay, Shinatose-san?
Stop it, Kunato-kun!
Don't worry.
I'm not surprised Akai-san and the others won!
The best in Sidonia?
Yeah!
Come in!
It's a class H2 Gauna. We won't lose.
I hope all this ends soon.
Follow directives and disperse over target!
All frames, fire at will.
Firing Hyggs cannon!
I will slay it.
shikkari shiroListen to me!
Focus on holding back the Gauna.
Momose?
All frames, disperse!Spread out!
Momose, cardiopulmonary arrest.
I'm sorry.
Hey, are you okay?!
Kunato sent his opponent flying again.
Congratulations, Kunato.
He beat the redoubtable Tsuruuchi!
Midorikawa Yuhata!
Hey, Yuhata! We're in the middle of something here!
Yes.
No, no.
Not enough!
announcerThirty seconds left on the clock!
This is great!
She possesses outstanding insight and a strategic mind capable of replacing me.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am!
I ruined it for you.
We reserved the place for the entire day.
Sorry, sorry.
Subjugation Squad has engaged G487.
Roger!
I have starboard.
Good!
What's wrong?
Yes.
Roger.
You bastard!
Give me my Akai-kun back!
Listen to us, Momose!
Momose!
Affix your safety harness to a railing at once and brace for acceleration.
I repeat.
No way! It won't withstand that much!
Who cares?!
It's not enough.
All able pilots and trainees are to report to the Gardes hangar immediately.
All able pilots and trainees are to report to the Gardes hangar immediately.
What's the Gauna's trajectory?
Two Kabizashis are adrift, but only one is in range.
It's right on the edge of a frame's operational range.
If you accelerate too much, you will be lost forever.
I'm a full Gardes pilot.
Retrieval squad is fast approaching the search area.
We're moving up the return time.
Commence search immediately once we reach the designated area.
Roger.
Roger.
We will arrive soon at the location where the Kabizashi was last spotted.
We will return now.
Link lost to Kunato and Honoka frames!
It won't move.
Maybe I should reboot it.
No way!
Incredible.
Tanikaze has defeated the Gauna.
That guy piloting Tsugumori ain't half bad.
G487 has been defeated by Tanikaze.
Roger.
Tanikaze, if you go any further, you won't be able to come back to Sidonia!
q2Akai-san!
I will charge it.
Momose?
Roger.
Accelerate to stage five and delay one lateral thruster.
Affix your safety harness to a railing at once and brace for acceleration.
I repeat.
Ten seconds until first thruster is fired.
G487 is closing in rapidly.
G487 has missed Sidonia.
Kill thrusters!
No change in G487's trajectory.
It's clearing the final defensive area.
Equip defense squads with eight Kabizashis.
Other trainees will be on standby.
Take up your positions.
Good.
West Four launch pads ready.
Roger.
I will collect it now.
Roger.
Retrieval squad has begun its return.
En!
Link lost to Kunato and Honoka frames!
Hoshijiro!
Hoshijiro's Hyggs engine is out of control.
bgTow Honoka and Kunato back and evacuate the vicinity at once.
No way!
Tanikaze is unhurt.
G487 has been defeated by Tanikaze.
Okay.
Tanikaze, are you unhurt?
Hey!
I know Hoshijiro's direction and velocity at the time she bailed.
He's about to cross the line of no return.
bgCan you hear me, Tanikaze?
Damage to Tanikaze frame: heavy.
I'm sorry.
All frames are to return.
There she is!
Come on!at frame
Yeah.
I didn't want you to come for me so I didn't respond.
I only just started, so I need it.
Why indeed...I don't know.
The rubble has been removed from residential areas, and life is back to normal.
Please do pay attention during lecture.
You know the answer, right?
It was in the fifth century after Sidonia's departure.
I had no idea combat rations could taste so good.
We didn't really learn anything since our first encounter with them.
But you know, the first Gauna who descended to Earth was humanoid.
What's wrong, Tanikaze-kun?
There's no water coming out.
Let's switch to the auxilliary sensor.
Tanikaze-kun!
Tanikaze-kun!
Calm down.
The Gardes' lubricant contains water, doesn't it?
Please!
Water! We have water, Hoshijiro!
Your orders, Captain.
Roger.
No change to Tanikaze's course.
Send out a squad to retrieve Kunato and Honoka immediately.
I'm really glad you're unhurt.
I'll try opening it manually.
I'd say we're looking at about ten days of food and water.
You lived with him underground?
Yeah.
Why indeed...I don't know.
These days especially I don't want to be associated with you.
Well, there are those annoying clowns.
I'm fine.
You should eat it.
You know, sometimes I have the feeling the Gauna are trying to be friends.
I'm not getting water.Why's the water not coming out?
Maybe the water tank's sensor is damaged.
Empty?!
No water or food left.
All right!
Okay!
Hero?
I'm gonna toast you later.
Let's make do and use a Type 18's.
I'm glad I wasn't alone out there.
It's basically back to normal.
then he will eventually part ways with you.
It's delicious fried.
I'd love some, then.
How was the medical?
Good. I'm fine.
Good to know.
Whoa, this looks delicious!
It's been ages since I ate some decent food.
anti-war views are spreading amongst the populace.
Wow!
Congratulations, Tanikaze-kun.
but for you and the others it must be hard
Let's do it.
Thank you.
Get in.
O-Okay.
Wh-Why do you favor me?
You recommended yourself.
I was worried you'd made a mistake.
Let's go to the bathyspheres to celebrate your becoming a pilot!
Pilots can only bring one person with them.
The door will now open.
Will we be okay? It's started moving.
Looks like we got separated from the others again.
i1No.
Large object off Sidonia's trajectory by 32 degrees laterally and -13 degrees vertically.
bgHive-type Gauna has penetrated the level three defense line.
Tanikaze-kun.
We managed to repel the hive-type Gauna, and of the 29 constituents, only a single one has escaped.
Perhaps we could have eliminated the last one as well if he had severed the tail sooner.
Knights of Sidonia
Are these Gardes?
256 frames on reverse thrust.
Trainees Tanikaze and Hoshijiro were feared lost, but are reported to have survived unhurt.
One might see this asCould this be the second coming of the knights of Sidonia?
Dissolve formation.
Thanks.
Rice?lol
It's been three weeks since the acceleration.
Thank you.
We hear the defense squad has returned, Kobayashi.
I got my hands on some really good gravity chicken today.im assuming that just as with gravity rice theres inferior food made under zero gravity conditions
I see.
Thanks.
Congratulations, Nagate!
Congrats, Tanikaze!
The curtain has risen on our war with the Gauna.
Honoka En, and Tanikaze Nagate full Gardes pilots.
We eleven are sisters, so we can tell each other apart,
Sounds good.
Huh? What's wrong?
Thanks.
What do you want?
O-Okay.
It must have discovered us before we did and approached invisibly.
Roger!
Let's go back inside.
My fault?
Tanikaze-kun.
1,000 kilometers until subjugation squad reaches target.
Please fire your reverse thrusters.
Roger!
Core exposed!
Kunato speaking. Three charges are ready.
Tanikaze-kun?
Enter a 118-frame formation!
Regroup at a distance.
We're pulling back!
Leave him!
We're pulling back!
Are you listening to me, Tanikaze?
How's he doing?
He wouldn't come out?
The Gauna will leave us alone if we disarm!
Sidonia must disarm entirely!
And what's with all the dust?
Nagate... You want to be a pilot to protect Sidonia, don't you?
But I will not stop the war.
Call Yure.
Begin preparations at once.
Calling it a great victory is a joke.
Are you okay, Nagate?
No...
Opening front bulkhead seven.
Good.
Continue observing missile until impact.
That isn't what I wish for!
You are talented.
Midorikawa.
Good.
Let's go back now.
Oh wow...
Launch them immediately.
Tanikaze.
I only fight the Gauna.
That's enough.
Doing so would significantly reduce the size of their placenta.
You need not fear.
Kunato speaking. Three charges are ready.
Kunato's squad has placed 12 charges.
Detonate the charges!
Detonation confirmed.
We have failed to sever the tail.
Awaiting further orders.
All frames, temporary retreat.
This looks just horrible.
Are you listening to me? This is a direct order!
Just a little more.
Run!
For as long as the Gauna exist, we cannot rebuild our homeland.
Wait here!
Yeah, I heard.
Open.
All personnel, brace for launch.
You are talented.
Implosion confirmed.
Relaying.
You're finally eating again.
Yup.
South Two launch pad, Samari's squad, board your frames.
Try to win back some time.
Knights of Sidonia
It's just placenta!
Formation 122A.
Is... that you... Hoshijiro?
Stop, Tanikaze!
Target eliminated.
What's wrong, Tanikaze?
Be careful, 219!
It's like it knows exactly how we operate.
All frames, fire in unison!
Be careful!
Respond, Kunato!
Roger!
Hou!
Frame 705 from Kunato's squad, severe cockpit damage!
i1We can count ourselves lucky it fled.
"Gauna on Sidonia's course rebuffed."
One of three... She's still alive.
Fear not, Hiyama.
after having subjugated a Gauna for the first time in history.
Thanks to him most of Sidonia's main archives are lost.
He refused to allow a new clone to be made and disappeared.
You spent ages in that tank.
Are you sure about this?
You won't live much longer.
I won't take the risk!
Lala!
We're pursuing G489 in a line formation.
G490 is corrupting frame 139.
Hoshijiro here, reporting one frame destroyed.
Don't rush in!
Hoshijiro!
They can't understand what you're saying!
It's hopeless!
Be careful!
Signs of withdrawal.
You bastard!
We've rallied with Kunato's squad.
Captain.
Is that why he's in every single battle?
Preparations for the departure ceremony are complete.
Silence!
It's too early!
That's more than at birth.
Did you tell her to make a clone of Hiroki?!
No! No! Hiroki, drop the longsword!
You won't live much longer.
q2i1Finding someone among the endless pipes of the old reactor winding around Sidonia is extremely difficult.
Huh?
Being called by her first name normally gets her comically mad.
Gaze.
Damage from annihilation is rapidly reversing.
So it's looking to come back.
It's only been three days since you fractured your spine, right?
Just hold on, all right? I'm going to get a doctor.
A good move from Kunato!
Having younger pilots catch up to our level is a good thing.
Good luck.
Aoki is in top form this year as well.
And the pilot who could match up to the Gauna in the Mark 17 Tsugumori was none other than...
Yuhata Midorikawa.
You stay out of this.
So how was it?
That's right. You said you were hungry.
Please tell me more the next time we meet.
Kunato delivers a devastating attack.
Or will one of them score the winning point?
Um, I'd like one.
I'm buying his and one more.
Interesting. Who wrote this up?
Midorikawa's younger sister.
I understand.
Give tomorrow off to those who will be sent out to combat.
I'll read through Yuhata Midorikawa's report as well.
Kunato.
Nagate.
Well, I should get back, then.
Oh! Akai!
Thank you so much!
Really?
Akai told us: "After meeting Tanikaze the other day, my nervousness disappeared."
That's why we'll beat that Gauna for sure. Just you wait and see.
Yuhata.
Gauna confirmed.
Yes, sir!
No!
No!
Akai!
Standing by.
On to the next matter.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to raise so many children?
They will photosynthesize.
Something up, Grandma?
Thanks.
I'm Tahiro Numi, and I work here at the EBD.
Why do you need Nagate?
I want to find out if it possesses human intelligence.
So where does Nagate fit into this picture?
For Nagate?
It reacted.
Don't let it get to you.
Nagate.
Gotcha.
Speaking of which,
Why has the captain come to our manor?
that they would allow prospective settlers to colonize planet seven of the Lem star system.
It is estimated that as many as 100,000 may eventually emigrate.
Then talk to me.
Tanikaze-san!
Stop!
I have to sortie.
Among their research projects, the placenta sample from G491 is highest priority.
She's... standing on the floor!
Don't you want to unwind for a bit?
Don't you want to unwind for a bit?
Sounds good.
We can't afford these expenses during wartime!
Fear not.
What's she do?
We don't know for sure it meant to attack you.
I'm Trainee Shinatose Izana.
Anything you'd like?
Speaking of which,
So far we've worked under the assumption that the Gauna are incapable of human intellect.
Onto the next news item.
Yeah.
Everyone is really divided on the issue.
Not yet.
I don't care about that.
Stop!
Among their research projects, the placenta sample from G491 is highest priority.
but also perfectly replicated personality and memories?
I understand.
Even if it mimics the late Hoshijiro exactly, what you see is nothing but Gauna flesh.
because you said you had the perfect plan.
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't double-booked us!
Yep, this sure wouldn't make it into the guide.
Man, what's this big, stupid puddle doing here?
I know that.
Wait!
It hit me again!
Come on!
We can't call for help!
Let's go.
Well, this sucks.
Where are we?
MSCF!
Izana?
Izana is my grandchild.
No, it's not.
Tanikaze.
So, how did we get back?
I'm Sasaki.
What?
This simulator is still under development.
I've used it countless times underground!
Opening all barriers of forward launch tunnel.
Sortieing.
Roger.
Tanikaze-san.
Guess the Gauna is out of range.
Tanikaze is slowing down.
The recoil threw him off balance!
What about the emigrants?
Especially among new recruits.
because you said you had the perfect plan.
Let me show you to your rooms.
Man, what's this big, stupid puddle doing here?
This book gives an account of some of the legends that exist in Sidonia.
"Voices from the dead."
Look at page 139.
Ochiai conducted forbidden experiments on Gauna placenta.
Hold on!
We can't call for help!
What is it?
I see.
Where are we?
Beats me.
Are you a Council member?
In the midst of the Fourth Defense War,
It appears there were unresolved problems piloting it.
We now have the power to exterminate the Gauna.
i1Endless oceans, endless plains.
Is this an SHSSuper High Speed Accelerator?
Distance to Sidonia is 5000 kilometers.
Wait.
Please!
The backpack propulsion system and the accelerator haven't been synchronized.
Gauna is now 10 kilometers away from the pioneers.
He will not make it!
He fired!
What about the emigrants?
Izana?
Especially among new recruits.
You guys are doing really well, but the survival rate among pilots is still very low.
Nagate, you went to the placenta again, didn't you?
How many constituents?
Keep an eye on her during the battle.
I will.
Switching to inertial cruise.
It is back on a collision course.
Granted.
Today, she faces yet another crisis.
We cannot know when they will attack.
The food here is great, and I love Sidonia and all of its people.
Having to carry all this and fight under gravity conditions isn't helping the survival rate.
Relative speed is zero.
Dissolve formation!
All platoon squads, prepare for battle!
Those are the different Gauna that make up the system!
Focus on evasion!
Shed it!
We're almost there, platoon 2!
Retreat!
We can't destroy all the cores alone!
Platoon 1 has 14 frames left.
i1Give me strength, brother.
We're supposed to go inside?
To all hands.
Leaving Kobayashi in charge was a mistake.
Prepare our ship for departure, just in case.
Congratulations.
How many constituents?
Why is it so huge?
It formed its placenta around a dwarf planet?
I will change our trajectory 0.5 using thruster No. 2 to perform evasive measures.
Please brace for emergency acceleration and stay indoors.
Please brace for emergency acceleration and stay indoors.
Director?
G542 is approaching.
Captain, permission to use our experimental weapon.
They want all the SHS Accelerators and Core Penetration Projectiles that we've got.cant we abbreviate these or somethingit's probably safe to abbreviate the accelerators since they showed it off last ep
Once your squad has been equipped, launch immediately.
And this battle will be under the dwarf planet's gravity.
I should have been your pilot.
Frame 278 is hit!
Propulsion system has been 20... 30... 35 destroyed.
Pull back at once!
Platoon 1 is low on CPP ammo!
i1Give me strength, brother.
i1There is a lot of empty space inside G542.
q2If we focus all of Sidonia's Hyggs cannons on the target, we might be able to open a hole in its placenta.
It's twenty times as long as Sidonia.
Dissolve formation!
Interior exposed.
Attack at once.
Yeah.
Will you take revenge in my stead?
Response from the Gauna!
You go slay the Master Gauna!
Hurry!
Hole has fully closed!
Hyggs density in the head is going through the roof!
Tanikaze!
The engine is threatening to overload.
Izana-kun!
They're breaking away from G542's surface.
Ten minutes until missile impact!
We can't do it!
We're under 10 on Hyggs particle storage!
Tsugumori is out of CPP ammo!
Benisuzume's placenta has fully regenerated!
Tanikaze's accelerator is heavily damaged.
Missile will impact the dwarf planet!
It's a Gardes!
G542, a massive Gauna that contained an entire dwarf planet,
was approaching Sidonia at high speed.
Kunato!
Any day is fine.
We didn't really treat you fairly after what happened to En.
Why is it so huge?
Roger.
Communication with platoon 2 commander lost!
We've lost all contact to platoon 2.
All frames, can you hear me?
Massive damage to G542's placenta!
Placenta is regenerating!
It's Benisuzume!
Shit!
Stay back!
Tsugumori!
You go slay the Master Gauna!
Okay.
There's nothing we can do at his altitude!
Wake up!
The engine will overload.
High-density Hyggs particle reaction from Benisuzume!
The Master Gauna is beyond that wall!
What about platoon 1?
Success!
Out of the 48 frames in the sortie,
Kunato!
but I lived underground for most of my life.
You're a great pilot, Kunato!
Any day is fine.
We're only about five years old, you see.
Knights of Sidonia
q2fscx92You may be trainees, but these kinds of results are within your reach with the Type 18 Gardes and its advanced autopilot.
Thanks.bg
Now go.
So I'll stay by your side.
so I am given to understand it was sealed.
Mozuku.
Yes, that is me.
Oh, I'm very sorry for your loss.
Oh, sorry.
The limits of life?
I am sickened by the though of a primitive lifeform
Wh-What are you doing?
How was it going back to school?
They asked you about the battle for the dwarf planet, right?
Ouch.
Is that it?
That's pretty rare.
The placenta specimen?
you mustn't let it blind you.
Thanks, Hiyama-san!
I'll be back as soon as I can.
No.
Yuhata let me borrow it.
And using what?
What's the recon?
We haven't even contacted all the pilots!
There is one target.
I'm ready now!
This is odd.
The Gauna core was not penetrated!
I didn't expect them to adjust to the core-piercing projectiles so quickly.
All frames, make sure your angle is right.
Confirmed penetration of shell layers.
Core penetration at sixty percent!
Hello, everyone.
Where is Kobayashi?!
Kunato-kun?
I'm sorry.
Is that Hoshijiro?
Massive Hyggs particle discharge by the Gauna!
I broke it during the last battle.
A-Anyway, Tanba-san.
Now you better get yourself to the hospital.
but it's really tasty.it's like sex in my mouth
I see.
If it really does,
Okay.
This chimera possesses a human heart and a Gauna's body,
with all the resilience that comes with it.
Moreover, she can be easily stopped in an emergency.
Were you reluctant at all to kill your relative?
Guess I have to apologize for shooting her.
The Gauna destroyed our home of Earth,
Go away, monster!
Thanks.
A pilot from my year.
Any objections?
Ochiai's clone.
Why does Kobayashi let you live, I wonder.
Well done.
Then Kobayashi shall be removed from her position.
We are once again faced with Gauna violating human space.
We need to eliminate every single Gauna in existence.
Our campaign has already begun.
Yeah.
Didn't you tell me to prioritize Tsugumori when we upgrade our units?
There are no records of this even in Ochiai's auxiliary brain.
i1It did not take long for him to finish what he promised he would: produce a chimera.
Is that the opinion of the rank-and-file of Sidonia?
It is a conglomerate of pure, evil hostility.
We have no choice but to fight.
For now, fighting seems our only option.
But there are different kinds of Gauna.
Those are precisely the kinds of thoughts that will be your undoing, Tanikaze.
Sure!
Here....and the cat is saying "YOLO", which stands for "you only live once"... Just a little acrony we thought up...
It looks so fluffy and soft.
You should rest.
And now we are ordered to attack the large hive cluster.
High-density Hyggs particle reaction straight ahead!
Video feed incoming.
All frames have full magazines of core-piercing ammunition.
Estimated 500 individual cores within.
and our communications can no longer reach it.
Avoid close combat.
That was really cruel of the Gauna.
I can still fight!
You are exhausted from battle.
You cannot fight any longer.
i1Cease this madness, Tsumugi!
Tsumugi is pursuing the second wave.
Second wave has been reduced to below fifty percent effectives.
Tsumugi!
Tsumugi!
Annihilate them!
Roger.
What are you doing?
Close your eyes, Izana-san.
Tsumugi?
Are you okay, Tanikaze?
Izana!
Hyggs particle density spike detected within Tsumugi.
Oh shit!
She'll be fine.
They're useful.
Anyway, Nagate, does Tsumugi need more time?
I'm glad at least some people made it to Planet Seven.
And hello.
Hell yes!
Hoshijiro?
You woke up!
I'm so happy!
You're all right!
Be prudent.
Relay my confidence in her to Doctor Yure.
And we won't have stable gravity.
Please affix your safety harness to the closest railing and brace for deceleration.
We're almost there.
Let's go.
Artificial gravity will begin to compensate.
We're out, Nagate!
Wow!
All those people going on their daily lives.
We ought to adjust your artificial leg as well.
Knights of Sidonia
Sorry.
I'm getting another call.
Smells delicious!
I was thinking about how often we'll get to meet before it's over,
I wish we had peace.
Doctor Yure.
I hear our newest weapon is complete.
I'm Tsumugi's new pilot,
I hope you and I can get along as well as you two do.
Yes.
Here.
Haven't seen you in a while, Yuhata-chan!
The legendary weapon! Unparalleled!
I looked at the place I'm moving to today.
"Only if I want?"
It's pretty far from the station.
That's good.
I don't really have to sleep.
Not so loud.
Yeah.
Well then, good night.
Rogue dwarf planet passing by.
Trials personnel are deployed for final adjustments.
Emitter is active.
an8Artificial gravity system is unstable.
We're not getting any system malfunction reports from the residential areas.
Send an order to the Gardes squads.
Numi-chan! You have to get it back under control!
Is that still not enough?
This is frame 203.
Why aren't we getting any updates?
bgPilots are on board.
bgThe mission area is a classified military installation, so...
Come with me!
The placental arms keep expanding.
You have to come with me!
Contact lost with 177.
bgGet it done!
The project files for this weapon were buried inside Ochiai's auxiliary brain.
It is a weapon of wonder.
Four Gardes frames can link up under its armor.
Yes.
Think of it as a good luck charm.
So much food that I never knew about.
What did you want to talk about?
So, piloting!
I told you this is my suit!
Permission denied.
Sections of the suit appear to have been modified without authorization.
Ouch!
Nagate!
Nothing much.
But don't take that to mean you're under surveillance or something.
No.
Quiet, Yuhata!
Shut up, Tsumugi!
Yay!
What's up?
So, intersex people adapt depending on their chosen partner.
Planet Seven, second satellite, main base, speaking.
I think we're all rooting for him.
Come on, Tsumugi.
Don't worry.
Push it in just a bit more.
Nobody is hurt,
Come on, turn that frown upside down.
Tsumugi!
I'm sure my Grandma's stew recipe will turn out great.
What's up, Tsumugi?
I wonder what it could possibly be.
Which is why I've moved in as well.
Izana-san!
All right, then.
Sometimes I feel like I was born with ten fingers on one hand.
And your arm?!
I'd never wear this!
Oh... Okay.
Oh, fine then.
I want to show you something.
Please, Sasaki.
i1Is he picking them up?!
Tsumugi!
I was right behind you on the way home!
Was your formation with Tsumugi so much fun you didn't notice?
Izana seems suited to it.
I'll blast your head off.
My involvement in this is to be kept secret.
Welcome back.
Can we talk inside?
Yeah.
I'll come.
Good morning.
See you later!
the Thousand Year Village.
I don't want to hear it!
Why would they send you on a mission there?
You can just flat out tell me if you're inviting me on vacation.
I-Izana.
HQ to repair platoons:
Floor joints in order.
Tsumugi.
What are you doing?
Bed in order.
What do you want to do?
Look at the pond!
She loves baths!
You know, I overheard their conversation.
What of Seven's colonists?
We must seize Nine at any cost.
I agree.
Forgive me, but you stuck artificial kabi on the tip, right?
It's called natto.
Izana?
The recon platoon will unite with Hayakaze, proceed to Planet Nine,
All central blast doors open.
It's here!
Beginning linkup.
Yes.
We are approaching the dark side of Planet Nine.
Don't let yourselves be dazzled by the rings.
I have to take their place.
Take it easy with her.
There is a haze of sorts in our flight path.
Platoon leader, what of the others?
Okay, somehow.
Midorikawa, draft a strategy to exterminate the Gauna around Planet Nine.
I'll be fine.
Losing the Gauna during atmospheric entry, smart.
No contact.
Ready for atmospheric entry!
This Gauna is different.
It's far larger than any previous Gauna!
Benisuzume?
Tsumugi outclasses Benisuzume.
It's been here since before we arrived.
Com link to Tanikaze restored.
XO Midorikawa, what about Tsumugi?
We are presently in combat with Benisuzume.
Did he deploy his recoil spades to stabilize the frame?
What is that sword?!
We can still improve it.improve it? this sounds weird in this context
Tsumugi's Hyggs particle density is rapidly dropping!
Multiple placenta stakes have penetrated Tsumugi.
Tanikaze-san!
Decisive battle.
What?
There's too many.
Bring it on!
Samari-san!
We won't let you touch Tanikaze and Tsumugi!
Protect them!
I would like to present my search-and-destroy mission using Hayakaze.
Leave none!
Good job.
I'm in here, Tsumugi.
I guess there's no turning back now.
Show me your medal.
Pay attention.
G604 has penetrated the first defensive line.
Roger!
So I'll stay by your side.
Ochiai's laboratory.
Please don't address me so,
Oh, no.
Was I really notified of that?
Gardes production may have been reallocated to Toha Heavy Industries,
to the improvement and advancement of our technological skills.
Whenever I see a Gauna,
I'll call for help!
How was it going back to school?
Don't tell me you're slicing her up!
but they've stopped all of a sudden.
It's not like he's eating nothing at all.
Yuhata!
I'll forget about it all, XO Midorikawa.
What the hell is that?!
Everyone is still floored.
Distance is 360,000 kilometers.
She may not look all that different,
I'm ready now!
That engine thrust is crazy!
All frames within range.
Keep to the battle plan and don't approach further.
Oh, no.
Relay it to the frames.
Roger!
Core penetration down to twenty percent!
It's ten times faster than a regular Gardes!CHAR?! No wait...
I'm kinda busy here!
Hello, everyone.
My name is Shiraui Tsumugi.aw yeaaah
Hello, everyone.
My name is Shiraui Tsumugi.
It's just as you see.
I made a chimera.
That is where you come in, Doctor Shinatose.
What are you doing?
Thank you, Pilot of Tsugumori.
Is that Hoshijiro?
Frame 101, heavy damage.
Powerful Hyggs reaction from second Gauna!
We will now vote on Kobayashi's removal.
Now you better get yourself to the hospital.
Today at 1800, the chimera will be available for questions.
Excellent work.
Yes?
Put access restrictions on his entire research.
I will be the only one who touches it directly.
I will now explain chimeras.
You need only issue an order.
Moreover, she can be easily stopped in an emergency.
The Gauna destroyed our home of Earth,
and Sidonia might be the last refuge of the human race.
My deepest apologies for what just occurred.
Oh, okay.
Don't get too close, Nagate.
Really?
touch you?
I shall be the next representative as planned.
Maybe gravity is taking its toll on your brains
Then Kobayashi shall be removed from her position.
It is done.
There is only one way to ensure the survival of the human race,
The military has raised the threat level to 10.
We should be able to improve the cockpit armor of about 60 Type 18s.
It wasn't worth recording.
i1It did not take long for him to finish what he promised he would: produce a chimera.
The problem aren't the colonists; it's the large hive cluster.
I'd love to see it!
You should rest.
Right. Is there anything you want to do?
What are you doing here, Yuhata?
I came here to inspect the chimera and go over an upcoming Gardes joint exercise.
Let's all do it!
You too, Yuhata.
Deployment exercise rescinded.
Prepare Gardes squads for launch.
We can attack now and intercept them further out from Sidonia.
Gardes squads launch preparations ongoing.
Trying to destroy that many Gauna alone is foolish, whoever you are.
They're beginning to join.
This is not so bad.
Rotate frames and fire thrusters!
Go!
Vanguard units have all targets locked-on.
Avoid close combat.
Reaction from the Gauna entrapping Tsumugi.
We have no information from the inside.
Bubble disintegration for all Gauna confirmed.
Second wave will soon encounter Gardes squads in close combat.
You have fought well.
Battle report for Gardes squads!
Tsumugi!
Roger.
Give me an analysis, stat!
Stop firing!
All Gardes! Attack the emitter!
Oh shit!
Why do you stop, Tsumugi?
G550 will reach Hyggs particle firing density imminently!
Tanikaze!
What is it?
Tanikaze!
Core exposed!cool original sequence
and are now stationed in the hangar.
I'm glad you seem okay.
I'll pass.
That's all you're eating?
Will he be okay?
He looks very tired.
It's so cute and soft!
What of the other matter?
Sidonia will now undergo deceleration.
Wow!
Look at all those people there!
Oh, right.
I'm just glad to see you're okay.
Want something to eat?
I wonder what it is.
I wish we had peace.
Dissolve formation!
The outer wall?!
Let me look for the pipe maps.
How about this place?
This seems perfect.
Did anything nice come in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'll live on the outer wall!
You might have permission to live there,
This place is great!
Hold your breath, Izana.
We would've had to clean up anyway.
The pipes are quite roomy, so getting here was very comfortable.
I don't really have to sleep.
I found this one on the wall in the back.
This is my first time seeing one.
We should go to bed.
Well then, good night.
Is that a no?
This would have been a great opportunity to mine for raw materials.
No interference detected.
Opening supply.
Opening safety valves.
firing.
Connecting Hyggs particle supply.
All matter within 100 kilometers of the emission axis has been annihilated.
Magnificent.
an8Gravity warning.
an8Gravity warning.
What the hell?
Can't you trace the gravity malfunctions?
Roger.
Please evacuate, Captain.
bgSquads are on standby.
The commander ordered us to evacuate!
Immediately!
What of the Gauna?
Frankly speaking, we have very little idea of what it exactly looks like inside.
And this.
Well, chances are you'll never get a chance to use it.
I want to talk to you.
I got totally carried away with the food.
What did you want to talk about?
This'd be a ghost ship without you and Tsumugi.
I will have to order friends to their deaths again...
we would have lost a lot more people.
Hey, Tanikaze.
I told you this is my suit!
Pilots, please be on standby.
Come on!
But don't take that to mean you're under surveillance or something.
The fools, clinging to their weapons.
Planet Seven, second satellite, main base, speaking.
If you've chosen to be a woman, it means you found a man!
That was close.
I'm so sorry!
but you should really be more careful.
Looking forward to it.
Hold on!
It's way too revealingslutty!
I guess I got a bit carried away remembering the past.
I haven't done this in a quite a while.
Izana?
The Type 17 Tsugumori!
I want to reenact a quad formation with Shiratsukis!
What's going on?
Look at those two.
What's wrong, Shinatose?
You have permission to enlist someone to help you.
My involvement in this is to be kept secret.
In her room.
Izana?
Can we talk inside?
You know it?
I'm not used to this.
I guess you don't want to spend a night in some decrepit place.
Really?
What's the matter?
Later!
We're on a mission, Izana.
Right.
Let's go, Nagate!
Izana!
How's your boyfriend?
We can't leave them in the Thousand Year Village alone!
Why is that even on the list?
Blast walls operating perfectly.
Wait!
Stop moping and go to bed!
You don't actually care about me, right?
We must seize Nine at any cost.
You just want all those replacable pilots to make a suicide dive for the large hive cluster!
with this wonderful new toy during a boring recon op.point being: she implies the commander would either allocate the suicide jackets to test them on noobs, or the elites without suicide equip, and nagate isn't flying, so...
It's called natto.
Roger.
They're in the way!
Roger.
Relative velocity insignificant.
Beginning linkup.
Go walk it off.
Tsumugi.
I wanted to be there for her.
Be careful.
No.
The Gauna might jump us from the other side any moment.
What is this?!
Entry.
I have to take their place.
I'm here.
Captain.
Midorikawa, draft a strategy to exterminate the Gauna around Planet Nine.
Calm down, Tsumugi!
i1This isn't good.
Please allow us to test the performance of the chimera and the Tsugumori Mk. III.
Yeah, that's good.
Just go with your best guess.
I have thousands of hours under gravity conditions in the simulator.
i1But the Gauna we encountered attacked Gardes that weren't carrying kabizashi as well.
Formation!
Speaking!
Wow.
Random Encounter.
Benisuzume.
i1Thank you.
It's also safer than staying with the Gardes.
You know, just making sure.
The others are coming too.
Come on!
We are presently in combat with Benisuzume.
We can see numerous Gauna contacts around his impact location,
an8New Gauna contact rising from the gas clouds.
Benisuzume's Hyggs particle density is swiftly increasing!
What's going on?
Another five to six stakes have penetrated Tsumugi.
Nagate's pulse is rising.
I'm connected!
The Hayakaze vanguard has entered orbit around Planet Nine.
Roger.
Do it.
Good job.
q2There is no evidence that placenta separated from the core can attack human beings autonomously.
Can you carry Tsumugi to us?
Let's go.
What of the large hive cluster?
Soon a dream from a century ago will come to fruition.
In recognition of your valor during the conquest of Planet Nine
You have my thanks as well.
The hearts of men are frail.
i1But I'm glad I left.
i1I grew to really like Sidonia.
Pay attention.
i1Grandpa.
G604 has penetrated the first defensive line.
Get ready to sortie.
Squad, quad formation!
You said he went after the rice facility, right?
Creeps me out.
The Mole Man?
Ludicrous.
Look, it's Kunato and Hoshijiro.
We will have to investigate
whether he truly has inherited Saitou Hiroki's experience and knowledge.
Did we make Yamano angry?
Another one?
Someone apprehend him!
One day, he dies, and then you slowly run out of supplies.
I see.
Oh, this?
Don't worry.
Are you some super-talented guy, Nagate-kun?
I figured you must be special with the way they ushered you in and whatnot.
After this, the Gauna will cease its activity and the placenta will disintegrate.
Bring it back in one piece or I'll kick your ass!
Tanikaze frame: Hyggs engine to reach launch output in 20.
That could be bad.
Tanikaze Nagate is alive again!
The Gauna's actions are completely meaningless!
Shinatose, retreat!
You can't destroy the core without a Kabizashi!
We only fended it off.
There are no Gauna!
A hive cluster has appeared within our danger zone.
Communication with them is impossible.
Hey, Shinatose.
Correct.
This allows us to only have to eat once a week.
Deodorant?
Do you have any idea how many lives were lost a century ago during the gravity failure?
And he came back a mess.
We had a Type 17 VR Simulator in our basement.
I was drilled by my grandpa.
It itches.
This is Kunato Norio, the top cadet of the 628ths!
Right.
Look at that!
Do you know what's wrong?
Kunato, did you hear?
You'll be the youngest champion in history!
Stop, Midorikawa!
Get out of here, Momose.
Captain, permission to arm the defense squad with Kabizashis.
Prepare the thrusters.
Once again, all hands, fasten your safety belts to a railing and...
Not here. This one's full too.
Hoshijiro.
We're not far enough.
Gauna 487 has changed trajectory.
Cut thrusters immediately.
Gauna 487 remaining on course.
What's the casualty report?
En Honoka, and Nagate Tanikaze.
And it's at the very outer limit from where you will be able to return.
West Gate Four is ready for launch.
So how was it? What's your impression of your first real Gauna?
Brother!
Tanikaze!
You're right. Sorry.
Copy that!
Cut thrusters.
What?
Kunato to control.
We're getting a Heigus particle reading from Gauna 487.
No way.
Kunato and Honoka's comms are down.
No use. It won't budge. Maybe I'll reboot it.
Hoshijiro!
It has a Heigus particle cannon... and a big one at that.
It has a Heigus particle cannon... and a big one at that.
Tanikaze has the Kabizashi and is heading towards the Gauna!
Tanikaze has eliminated the Gauna.
Uh... Um...
Get back here, Tanikaze!
It itches.
Winner: Kunato!
Let us watch the pivotal play in Kunato's match once more.
He beat the redoubtable Tsuruuchi!
Midorikawa-san is doing great too.
Tanikaze-kun.
I just wanted to get a look at the man who faced down a Gauna.
What was it like?
I'll have some more questions for you then.
What are you doing here anyway?
Yes.
Do you plan to stand on the battlefield, Seii?
Wait!
Oh, right!
Akai Mochikuni is the winner.
Akai-san?!
There's a sea up here?
Give them some time alone.
We'll be fine.
Stage one battle speed, engaging at medium range!
The Gauna core is exposed!
Careful, Akai!
Can you go, Midorikawa?
Roger.
Give me my Akai-kun back!
The subjugation squad has been annihilated.
No change in collision course.
Yes, ma'am!
This is a gravity alert!
Please! Let me on!
Okay!
Still?
West Four launch pads ready.
Looks like you're hungry, so let's continue our discussion another time.
256, they say.
Roger.
This isn't a drill.
Good.
En!
Hoshijiro frame lost.
Tanikaze has taken the Kabizashi and is approaching the Gauna.
He's approaching the Gauna.
G487 has been defeated by Tanikaze.
Move out to rescue the retrieval squad.
Hey!
Contact with pilot lost!
bgCan you hear me, Tanikaze?
What's he planning?
Damage to Tanikaze frame: heavy.
He's about to cross the line of no return.
Com link cut.
Let's go to my Gardes for now.
Truth is, I'm completely out of Hyggs particles.
I didn't want you to come for me, so I didn't respond.
I didn't want you to die just for my sake.
My Hyggs particle collection membrane won't open.
Oh, no.
This is making me hungry.
Now that's a sight to behold, Hoshijiro!
Tanikaze-kun,
I drank too much!
I'm photosynthesizing.
Where did you get your emergency training?
You should've seen how proud he was when I broke his record by the time I turned six.
Why indeed...I don't know.
About five hundred.
I don't think there are many who know it now.
You know, sometimes I have the feeling the Gauna are trying to be friends.
Tanikaze-kun?
Listen to me!
All right!
You did it, Tanikaze-kun!
I'm just kidding.
What can I do?
I don't think anybody's ever tried filtering the lubricant.
Let's go.
Are these Gardes?
They've come for us!
Trainee Tanikaze single-handedly slew the Gauna
Dissolve formation.
Aw.
You fine already, Tanikaze?
Welcome back.
Rice?lol
And there's somewhere I want to go.
It is likely that Sidonia has entered a region of strong Gauna presence.
Here you go.
It's so good.
Even while Sidonia is ecstatic with the news of the rescued trainees,
The rabble will always desire a hero.
Come on! Come on!
but for you and the others it must be hard
Huh? What's wrong?
O-Okay.
You seem to be doing well.
Wh-Why do you favor me?
I'll make you some!
Twice.
Looks like we got separated from the others again.
It's an amalgam of numerous bodies with a thick, unified placenta.
You can walk?! No way.
I'm fine.
It wasn't Tanikaze's fault alone that the tail was not severed.
Doing so would significantly reduce the size of their placenta.
Dissolve formation!
Let's do it.
Weren't we going to do this together?
Gauna is reacting to the detonation.
The Gauna is detonating the lost charges!
Give up on the tail.
You killed Hoshijiro.
The people are a nonissue.
This room is a mess!
Preposterous.
You called for me?
Calling it a great victory is a joke.
Hey.
This is the planet that the Gauna fled to after the last battle.
Good.
Why?!
That isn't what I wish for!
You are talented.
More talented than anyone before you.
Penetrating target.
And yet a Gauna's core will stay unharmed.
Good.
Is that wound on your head really okay?
I'm glad I could cheer you up a little.
Thanks, Izana.
Oh wow...
I've boarded my frame.
Try to win back some time.
Image analysis complete.
I'm putting it on the main screen.
Samari's squad takes G489.
All squads have dispersed towards their target.
That hurts!
Look at that stuff trailing from G491!
i1They're emulating the Gardes.
Target eliminated.
Stop it!
Gather all frames and assist Nakazono!
Roger!
I can't shake it off!
Nakazono's squad has been annihilated.
Roger!
Hou!
Frame 705 from Kunato's squad, severe cockpit damage!
Scratch one frame.
You bastard!
Tanikaze!
If we pursue it, we won't have the resources to engage.
"Gauna on Sidonia's course rebuffed."
There must be no immortals other than us.
Captain.
You haven't forgotten the consequences of Ochiai's actions one hundred years ago, have you?
q2Recall six hundred years ago, when we swore to serve Sidonia on the Immortal Council with our experience and sagacity
Welcome back.
A mere two Gauna made it into Sidonia.
He fought for so long.
He was tired.
That's more than at birth.
You can't take him directly from the amniotic tank!
I won't take the risk!
Negotiations have evidently broken down.
This is my child!
She's always so nice to us.
I'm sorry, Hiyama-san!
Gaze.
What about the food supply?
Trainee Shinatose.
I'm Trainee Shinatose Izana.
Are you really sure about this?
...power...
I don't care about that.
i1Is it Benisuzume?
The pilots are to board faster.
Why does Tsugumori have a Kabizashi?
What if the Gauna didn't just take human form,
Tanikaze-kun, I meant what I said earlier in a purely scientific manner.
You see, I have the day off.
Want to go on a little vacation soon?
The Kabizashi?
Whatever place you've been raving about doesn't seem to be in this neighborhood.
What were you thinking?
I'm the owner of Gravity Hall. My name is Tanaka.
Let me show you to your rooms.
This entire discussion is taking a really creepy turn.
Numi-chan, I'll put this entire operation on the highest security level.
We can't call for help!
What is it?
Hey! Come here!
Beats me.
Yuhata!
I do not know.
and we have used the material gathered from it to produce man-made kabi.
Right. Been told.
Gardes backpack propulsion system.
This simulator is still under development.
Sasaki-san!
Is the propulsion system ready for use?
I've used it countless times underground!
Now listen!
The simulator we're developing
Gauna is now 10 kilometers away from the pioneers.
I'm not surprised.
He won't make it.
That's pretty crazy.vague, not sure if positive
I bet he's at the EBD.
It looks good on you.
Nagate, you went to the placenta again, didn't you?
Whatever!
Leave me alone!
I repeat.
G542 is approaching.
How long until collision?
Captain, permission to use our experimental weapon.
They want all the SHS Accelerators and Core Penetration Projectiles that we've got.cant we abbreviate these or somethingit's probably safe to abbreviate the accelerators since they showed it off last ep
Course prediction sights' range is 1.05 million kilometers.
Lend me your aid.
It's going to catch up with us later.
We're finally able to fight them from a distance.
Stop decelerating.
bgHow am I supposed to fight this monster?!
Dissolve formation!
Proceed as planned.
All platoon squads, prepare for battle!
Platoon 2 has begun simultaneous firing.
Hits confirmed on propulsion.
Stay in formation!
Focus on evasion!
We will be hit eventually!
My frame is so heavy! I can't!
We can still use our Hyggs cannons too!
Another seven!
i1Give me strength, brother.
Prepare for firing.
Final safety switches released.
Orbit the Gauna!
Hyggs cannons on the surface!
I'm hit!
Interior exposed.
We're so close.
Tanikaze-san!
The pilot however is unconscious!
I will not give up on Nagate!
This is bad.
No response!
Tanikaze-san!
Take this!
Frame detected emerging from the remains of the dwarf planet!
G542, a massive Gauna that contained an entire dwarf planet,
Due to Tanikaze Nagate's heroic conduct, G542 was defeated.
but I lived underground for most of my life.
The Gauna core has been destroyed.
Get back here, Tanikaze!
Tanikaze, your Garde is heavily damaged.
Tanikaze.
All units return. The operation has been completed.
All defensive squad units, return to base.
Oh, okay.
What's the matter?
Wow.
And eight combat rations.
Let me see something.
You did great today.
The first time I beat his score when I was 6, he was really happy for me.
Good question.
It's been seven days since the diagonal acceleration tragedy.
Debris removal in the residential area has finished up.
Yes, that's right.
Oh, don't say that.
the strike team ventured inside the structure
I'm sure that the reason Hiroki took that boy and hid him underground was
because he didn't agree with all the things going on.
I'm still doing okay.
Yeah, better than the ones we had yesterday.
How many are there?
Is it really a seed ship, or could it be a nest?
But, you know, the first Gauna that descended upon Earth had a human-like form.
but that's the first time something like that had ever happened.
But, you know, I wonder if the Gauna actually want to be friends with humanity.
What?
Oh, no.
Tanikaze, hang in there! Tanikaze!
What do I do?
Open your mouth.
That's right. Drink it.
Oh, that's right!
Oh, y-you're right.
Okay, here goes.
They came back for us!
I hope you're prepared to take responsibility for this.
I'm kidding!
What? It can't be.
Perhaps he's the second coming of the Knight of Sidonia!
The men's room is over there.
I'm glad you're okay, Tanikaze. Welcome back.
Tanikaze's piloting skills are too important.
You will be the one to dispose of Nagate Tanikaze.
Excuse me, Ms. Hiyama.
Wow! Let's eat!
That's something to be proud of.
Oh, thanks.
Just remember that En was the one who broke your nose, okay?
Hoshijiro?
Excuse me.
Dipping sauce? As in tempura dipping sauce?
I know that my injuries heal faster than normal.
Is there some sort of secret about me?
It was your own abilities.
just like the legendary hero who once defended this ship.
Of course I am!
That's fine. But the submarine pods can carry four people.
Uh, sure.
It looks like we're getting the full tour. And a second one.
Captain.
Form a strike team at once.
Hey, wait for me.
Resolve.
Doctor!
What's her deal, though?
Martial law has to be lifted!
Don't worry.
One day, he dies, and then you slowly run out of supplies.
Tanikaze Nagate.
Nice to meet you.
I figured you must be special with the way they ushered you in and whatnot.
You probably don't know, having lived underground,
Hey, look.
So they made a new frame, huh?
and pierce its core with a weapon specifically designed for such a task.
Exactly.
What the hell?!
Let them.
Tanikaze.
That's enough.
Roger.
A Gauna has appeared!
You've achieved so much, starting from our little town!
Ah, you've never worn a skin suit before?
It's not  may not be a combat op, but securing natural resources is just as crucial.
This is nothing.
All frames, full speed ahead!
I'll be so proud of you if you become a pilot, Eiko.
They can't hold!
Prepare to fire the Heavy Mass Driver!
Give his frame remote support.
That's enough, Tanikaze!
We only fended it off.
It's within our level 3 danger zone.
The army must lift martial law immediately!
Dismissed.
As soon as he joined, we encountered a Gauna.
Ignore them.
Sorry, we're in a hurry.
This allows us to only have to eat once a week.
We're in class!
Want to come with me?
I think it's fine, but they told me not to take the cast off.
It itches.
That information was not made public.
I should invite Nagate.
So nice to meet you in person!
Impressive!
The Gauna we repelled has made a move.
It is rebuilding its placenta.
These four are Sidonia's finest Gardes pilots.
Got it?
Oh, right.
Okay, bye!
Nah, Kunato is going to win this year.
They must have been about this close to you.
No, no.
I'll have some more questions for you then.
I'll help as best I can.
Weren't you the one getting in our way?
is that Tsugumori stopped it.
Oh, a "fair idea".
Akai Mochikuni is the victor!
It looks delicious.
Glad to hear it.
Yes.
Send me Midorikawa Yuhata's proposal to read.
Wait!
I ruined it for you.
The best in Sidonia?
Yeah!
The water reservoir comprises one fourth of Sidonia.
Look, Nagate!
Good.
Follow directives and disperse over target!
Stage one battle speed, engaging at medium range!
Aoki, Midorikawa, encircle the target.
What's wrong?
Belay sortie target one.
Akai is dead!
Focus on the mission!
Momose?
Midorikawa frame, severe damage.
The subjugation squad has been annihilated.
Fire the Heavy Mass Driver ASAP.
And only for vertical acceleration!
Okay!
Hurry up, Nagate!
Ten seconds until first thruster is fired.
All systems ready.
We're working on it.
It looks far worse than expected.
Yes, ma'am!
Sidonia will not decelerate to collect you.
Commence sequential launch of all frames.
Yuhata...
Keep up!
Third defense squad, are you ready yet?
What will happen to us?
Hoshijiro speaking.
I don't think it's near me either.
Good.
I will collect it now.
It's heading for the retrieval squad.
Good.
Kill the thrusters! Quick!
Strike!
bgCan you hear me, Tanikaze?
Gauna has fired its Hyggs particle cannon.
Contact with pilot lost!
Obey your orders, Tanikaze!
G487 has lost much of its placenta!
Core exposed!
Hyggs particle storage low.
I know Hoshijiro's velocity at the time she bailed.
Let's go to my Gardes for now.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
We have to try to follow Sidonia on the off chance it did stop.
Eight combat rations over here.
What?
You lived with him underground?
Yeah.
Hoshijiro?
About five hundred.
I am an ill target for your grievances, Lala.
Call me by my full name!
To conduct a more detailed investigation, the expeditionary force entered the structure,
The shining grains that pierce a Gauna's core are called "kabi" after an ancient name for rice ears.
We've never been able to establish contact.
That was the first time it appeared like that in almost two hundred years after the first contact.
How?
Drink slowly.
How are you feeling?
We will survive!
Put it on the main screen.
I don't think the ship's defense wing has ever collectively mutinied.
You realize that you will be punished?
Your orders, Captain.
Let's go.
Dissolve formation.
There's nothing to do in the dorms.
The hero's homecoming.
I had a feeling you'd be here.
How was the medical?
Good to know.
Yeah. I agree.
They're using his combat data to update the VR simulator!
to tell who's who.
Come on, you two.
What are you drinking there?
I'll make you some!
It appears to be a hive-type Gauna.
No time to waste, Tsuruuchi.
This is your fault, Tanikaze!
How did I get here?
Roger!
Core exposed!
Shit!
Is Kunato's squad making progress on the tail?
Kunato, hurry and sever it!
Prepare for detonation.
Kunato speaking.
The Gauna's attention is on its tail!
Tanikaze, what are you doing?
We're pulling back!
We had some real hope in the pilot.
Can you hear me, Nagate?
Come on, go.
Okay.
Numerous Gauna might well hide in its gas.
No...
All personnel, brace for launch.
Ready for launch.
Launching missile!
I want to be a pilot in my brother's stead!
Impact in 5 seconds.
C-2-9, nothing.
Two bodies, size less than one kilometer.
Roger.
Nakazono's squad, board your frames.
Launch them immediately.
Yuhata?
Is that a humanoid type?
Undead.
Focus on your target.
It hurts, it hurts!
Where's that voice coming from?!
i1They're emulating the Gardes.
Samari speaking.
Hoshijiro!
R-Roger.
It's so fast.
Immobilize the enemy!
Samari!
Be careful!
We have no choice.
Honoka Ren, Hou.
Firing particle cannon!
Where is it?
Captain.
Roger.
Roger.
Fear not, Hiyama.
If he truly has skill, he will not fall on the battlefield.
A departure ceremony?!
i1I can feel that many will disappear.
To access the auxiliary brain from the outside, we need to go through Ochiai's brain.
i1Her star continued to rise afterwards, and she joined the Immortal Council.
i1We don't know why Hiroki erased his tracks.
This is my child!
Knights of Sidonia
There has to be one host Gauna among them.
Engage reverse thrusters.
Roger!
Team, give me your count!
Imada's and Kunato's squads are withdrawing.
Affirmative! All units, fall back!
We'll regroup and reestablish our formation before the next attack!
No, our failure to separate the tail was not solely Tanikaze's responsibility.
Tanikaze!
Stop, Hoshijiro! Don't.
Understood.
many anti-military activists have redoubled their efforts.
Pull yourself together!
I'll be fine.
Yuhata Midorikawa, entering.
I didn't apply for the position!
Tinne till innpact:
Three, two, one.
F-5-8, K-3-7 clear.
Midorikawa.
I don't want Ms. Hiyama to worry about us.
Yeah. Izana, thanks.
Nagate?
South 2 deployment gate, Samari squad, is boarding.
Right.
Analysis of the video is complete!
What is that? Human-shaped?
No! I don't believe it!
Is... that you... Hoshijiro?
bgShe has to be joking.
I want to find out if it possesses human intelligence.
Check it out, there's Tanikaze!
Let us use this chance to retrieve the knowledge I told you about from the auxiliary brain.
Are you really sure about this?
Okay.
Isn't the decline in population a much bigger problem for us?
Yeah, sure.
Sorry, you two.
Let's start then.
Please wait.
It answered?
It's an H1-type Gauna.
Today, I will be in your squad.
You're the only one who can tell him to stop.
Man, I don't wanna be promoted.
I guess.
Doesn't that just mean nobody goes there?
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't double-booked us!
I'm the owner of Gravity Hall. My name is Tanaka.
Let me show you to your rooms.
"The mystery of the Immortal Council."
With my superior security clearance,
This entire discussion is taking a really creepy turn.
Something hit me!
No reception?!
Wait here!
Smelled?
It stopped.
All along, it wasn't just Ochiai's auxiliary brain that lay here.
What is behind that door?
This fused body is essentially a Gauna core without its protective shell,
Yes.
We now have the power to exterminate the Gauna.
Guess you over there must be the famous Tanikaze then.
I'm Tanba Shinsuke.
We have high hopes to drastically reduce its bulk.
This is it!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
All right, we will start testing tomorrow.
It's untested!
You're crazy!
That's pretty crazy.vague, not sure if positive
We still have time together!
We now have basically no time left together.
Leave me alone!
It's twenty times as long as Sidonia.
It formed its placenta around a dwarf planet?
G542 is on a head-on collision course with Sidonia.
All hands.
Switching to inertial cruise.
The Gauna almost invariably dodge the missile or shoot it down before it hits.
We have to shoot now or we won't make it.
At once?
There won't be any detailed adjustments, then.
I didn't know they'd already made so many.
No irregularities.
We're finally able to fight them from a distance.
Proceed as planned.
This is platoon 2!
Frame 278 is hit!
Fly close to the surface and evade the shots!
My frame is so heavy! I can't!
We can still use our Hyggs cannons too!
They got our commander!
One Gauna has departed the hive!
i1I have a plan, then.
q2If we focus all of Sidonia's Hyggs particles on the target, we might be able to open a hole in its placenta.
Please make sure to affix your safety harness.
i1This entire world should end.
Leaving Kobayashi in charge was a mistake.
Course prediction complete.
I can't see anything! I can't do it!
Prepare for firing.
Hyggs particle interference is affecting coms more than expected.
Tsugumori has an anti-Hyggs coating.
Hurry!
Hyggs density in the head is going through the roof!
Izana!
Eat this!
Tanikaze's accelerator is heavily damaged.
Benisuzume is closing in.
Zoom in! Do it!
It's a Gardes!
G542, a massive Gauna that contained an entire dwarf planet,
Sidonia was in grave danger of collision.
Out of the 48 frames in the sortie,
and the only thing I really want
To be honest, I still cannot forgive you.
But you, too, Kunato, are one of the many people on Sidonia I love and want to be happy.
Right!
Nakazono squad, Gauna 490.
All units, be aware, watch for enemy armaments.
This is Hoshijiro. Enemy craft down.
Kunato!
Kunato, Ren, Hou, head to back up Nakazono squad.
Signs indicate high levels of anxiety!
Honoka Ren, Hou. Work together and stop Gauna 490.
You bitch!
Tanikaze.
Samari squad, we've rendezvoused with Kunato!
The search and destroy operation was victorious, as they succeeded in destroying a Garde-formed Gauna.
Nobody outside of the council can be immortal.
To get him killed?
I didn't want Tanikaze to be imprisoned again.
Don't worry, Hiyama.
Captain, we've finished preparing the Resurrection ritual.
That was when we pledged our lives and knowledge to serve Sidonia,
She's not the grumpy sort.
Yeah.
We're 70 complete with the emergency repairs to the outer hull.
However, the core facilities were badly damaged, but it appears environmental lighting...
If the Tsugumori took even a little longer to return with the Kabizashi it went to reclaim,
You're very promising. What is your name, by the way?
Are you sure about this?
We went ahead and manipulated the genetics to your specifications,
but this replacement clone made from Saito's manipulated DNA
Lalah!
Are you really sure that there's a point to doing this?
Miss... Lalah.
That's weird.
Look at what's hanging off of Gauna 491!
A cylindrical Ena has penetrated the unit!
Can you hear me, Hoshijiro?
Stop, Tanikaze!
Knights of Sidonia
I'm doing fine, thanks.
Yeah. She's been very busy with work, so I haven't bothered going home in a while.
What does she do?
I mean, "it" back with you.
It's a pleasure.
Well, I'll shine some light through now, all right?
Hoshijiro.
Emotionally, as well.
Yes.
Do it.
Master Norio, I've unlocked access.
Wait! Please! I'm begging you!
but I've been told that the one sitting in the middle is the scientist Ochiai's clone.
You will need me...
to the seventh planet in the Lem star system.
Again?
You should try talking to it.
Get the pilots to board now.
You know, as his guy friend.
And the research on the Gauna 491 Ena specimen was given the highest priority.
If a Gauna not only recreated a person's form but also their complete personality and memories,
But...
There were more combat casualties.
Tanikaze! Look!
but you're going to have to realize...
It's important that we do something to keep our minds off of it.
Wait, Yuhata was saying the same thing right before...
And could those sandals of yours make any more noise?
Sorry.
You've come a long ways, friends.
Thanks for having us.
Thank you!
What is it? Do you know something about him?
I understand.
Hey, let's turn back.
It bumped me again! There's something there!
What? I'm sorry!
Tanikaze!
What?
Why did it stop?
Well...
Izana... Yuhata?
that was totally unlike the Gardes.
But it emits a radiation just like the Kabi, drawing the Gauna to Sidonia.
You will conduct a field test of the new weapon.
Midorikawa! Status update!
We're too late to deploy a Garde squadron now.
What's that?
You mean it's true?
It would have been more effective to make an example of the anti-military activists and leave them on their own,
But I will listen to you this time,
A composite round combining an impactor mass and a man-made Kabi penetrator.
The Kabi are fired as ammunition rounds?
Tanikaze is decelerating.
He shouldn't even be able to pilot it.
Izana?
What? That's great.
Collision.
Second Reclamation Station speaking!
You said he went after the rice facility, right?
Just talking about the Mole Man.
The Mole Man?
Get lost down there, and you won't make it back up.
So?
I'll pass.
You're so diligent, Yamano.
Yeah, let's just go without them.
It's important to have dreams.
Hoshijiro.
How odd that he would appear now.
Doctor!
Sidonia is ruled by undead!
Someone apprehend him!
Is this the police station the man who appeared from underground was brought to?
It is, but who are you?
I will be your legal guardian from here on out.
Do you accept?
Introduce yourself.
"Nice to meet you"?
Thank me later for yesterday.
You don't remember?
Not really.
Our body adapts when we choose our partner.
Hey, look.
It's me!
The Type 17 on display is gone.
Just a mining op, though.
Should we really be having trainees do the mining?
Your frame is in the fifth lane.
Nah, he's alive, they say.
This city was built a thousand years ago. The lower levels are basically a maze.
It's our duty to become real pilots posthaste and proudly serve Sidonia.
Hoshijiro might, but Kunato?
Yeah.un
Hoshijiro.
Let's go to my place after this.
We will have to investigate
then why are we even going through all this training?
Abolish martial law!
You're still healthy.
Is this the police station the man who appeared from underground was brought to?
Be at ease.
My orders were to escort you here.
I'm Hiyama and I run the dorms.
Get changed.
Introduce yourself.
Nice to meet you all!
I'm Shinatose Izana.
You can expect your hometown to celebrate if you ever get accepted.
You probably don't know, having lived underground,
We can successfully procreate with both men and women.
The core of a Gauna lies where the brain and spinal cord would be in a human being.
And start crying
Kobato...
Before that?!
Are you a basket worm hibernating until spring?!
I'm sorry.
You're impossible.
No, not at all.
Ioryogi-san.
Huh?
Here?
They're probably after the garbage.
They want the garbage...
Coffee?
What the heck did you come here to do?!
Are you hurt?
Anyone would misunderstand.
I'm short staffed as it is...
Why not? It's healthy!
Give it a try, you'd be surprised!
Uh, no, there's this song...
The baby seems to have stopped crying.
You're mean. You're just too mean!
Dear?
Oh, yes, good night.
Hm?
Huh?
It is the real thing, isn't it?
Your wish will come true.
Get that smirk off of your face. You'd better know what you're up against, Dobato!
My name is Kobato! Kobato Hanato!
Yes sir!
Excuse me! Isn't there something I can help you with healing?
Uh, yes. Please take it.
What a wonderful person!
I still have this much more to hand out.
Really?!
Now what are you going to do with all that?
Go ahead! There's no need to hesitate.
I'm sure he came this way.
I'm Toshihiko!
Uh, well...
Never mind about the name.
Play the organ!
Mr. Kiyokazu, will you play the organ?
I'm counting on your help today.
Let's dance!
But I'm not going to let that get to me!
I am...
You want to know what's uncalled-for?
I told you didn't I? Here, I am a stuffed toy and stuffed toys do not walk around on their own!
She works, does she?
But...
If only she would be more considerate and put herself in Toshihiko's position.
I mean I realize she's busy, but you know...
That's wonderful!
Should I say I'm going to collect healed hearts?
That's not what I meant!
What?! No way!
Hito wa mina tonde mitai no ni
Ano ko ga anna ni kanashisou na no wa
Dokoka ni wasurete kichatta kara kamo
Sore nara
What is it with you, always?
But when will "someday" come?
I can't wait forever
On "1, 2, 3!" I'll spread open my arms
And let the light gather around me
I didn't realize there were so many different kinds of jobs.
Like deliver newspapers in the fresh morning air.
I give up!
Ioryogi-san!
What happened?
She apparently injured herself the other day.
I hope you enjoy your job, Kobato.
Strawberry shortcake, Mont Blanc, cheese... the cheesecake... no not that, the apple pie. Oh and that lemon tart.
Then finally...
Kobato!
Kobato, can you wrap it up for them?
Yes!
Here you are. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thank you very much!
I was just thinking about Mr. Ueda.
I won't be able to have any more of this delicious cake.
Oh, but it might be good to work at different kinds of places.
Good morning.
Oh, please take care of things out here.
Yes. Um, actually I...
Good morning.
Oh?
I guess that means that she's married and has a husband.
But I'll do my best!
You're going way off tangent here!
Um, today, I'm a detective!
What? A detective?
Be generous, Genko.
If you're looking for a love counselor, try someone else!
Good evening.
What? What I have found out so far is that Bakery Tirol's cakes
about something other than work.
Oh! But Mr. Ueda always gives the little children some chocolate for free.
Yumi. We'll begin tailing him now!
What?!
Who could that be?
What should I do, Kobato?
Mr. Ueda.
Mr. Ueda... Then, that's what you were worried about?
Ah, sure.
It's good.
The manager wanted to give Yumi more time off... but Yumi wanted to help him more.
Does this have something to do with your "investigation network"?
Oh, that reminds me! Your score this time!
Hey.
Th-This is my hundred points!
No it isn't! You only get fifty points because you're mean!
If I could just tell you, "Thank you,"
It would make you feel so happy
Machikirenai yo
Sore de mo mada
How cute!
Yes. Ioryogi-san is happy, too.
So delicious
Oh, yes Perfection
I know that.
There are four worlds: "Tenkai," "Ningenkai," "Chikai" and "Ikai."
What must Iorogi do to return to Ikai?
Come on, have some of this.
Okay!
Um... What's a seminar?
It's a class at university.
Mhm.
Have a nice afternoon!
Darn, I can't get it off! That Fujimoto! He tied it too tight!
Yes!
Yes! See you tomorrow!
Master Genko!
Well sir, I'm a bird now. I can't help it.
You don't expect to keep me down for long in your present state, do you?
I-o-ryo-gi!
But you know, I like that name I have now.
Anyway, give back the bottle.
In the past, you would have done that.
She always thinks of herself last.
Don't do it!
Ioryogi-san!
so I didn't say hello.
You're hurting me, idiot!
Fujimoto?!
This is good!
Thank you so much for getting the bottle back.
Kimi ga shiawase ni naru
Shinpai nante iranai yo
Issho ni iru kara
Fushigi da
What is it?
I want to laugh when I'm happy
Please tell me what I can do
It is autumn indeed. Isn't it, Ioryogi-san?
Kobato! What is your wish?!
Oh! Um! I'm going to collect kompeito!
That place you wish to go. You do know where it is, I presume.
If you can't take care of them, I'm not letting you use them.
Kobato.
Fujimoto just left for work. Is something wrong?
He left without saying a word. That's not like him.
I wonder what happened.
So that's what happened.
Today we're going to collect fallen leaves.
You are to apologize to Fujimoto later too, okay?
I'm going to bring Teacher Fujimoto a whole bunch of leaves!
They want it removed because it's a disturbance.
Huh?
Huh?
What's wrong, Kobato?
I think the ginkgo must be feeling lonely.
Lonely?
Yes. In a way.
It's very happy because yesterday, many small people came to play. It was a lot of fun.
Kobato!
Can you hear it? Can you hear the ginkgo's song?
From way over yonder, from far I can hear
Your hand in my hand
Watch out, will you?! You could've gotten hurt!
What?
Like Kohaku said. Your song was a beautiful send-off.
Do you think so?
That exchange would fill you with joy
Oshiete, watashi ni dekiru koto
Now listen. Whatever potatoes you dig up, you carry yourself.
Ouch...
Wow!
Who could that be?
Does he live here, I wonder?
Kobato!
Wow!
He's just too mean. All he says to me is to not get in the way.
Oh. He was just passing by.
Said he'd been out digging potatoes.
Hey you!
Just as I thought.
What's your name?
It's where I used to live. My mom switched companies, so we had to move.
I haven't forgotten!
I haven't forgotten!
He always barked when I went by.
My mom always baked cookies and stuff.
Fujimoto.
Which way? Right? Left?
That's wonderful, isn't it Keita?
My mom always says that.
Mmm, this is good!
It is good.
My room...
We have no choice but to break it.
Well...
Isn't that nice, Keita?
Oww! What are you doing, you old fart?
Hi.
I suppose this kompeito is because he understood how his grandfather truly feels.
You complain too much. For that, you're back down to fifty!
Hito wa mina tonde mitai no ni
Ano ko ga anna ni kanashisou na no wa
"Arigatou," tte kimi ni ietara
Ittari kitari ureshiku naru
I'm making some decorations with this pretty paper.
What?!
Wh... What should I do?! Ioryogi-san?
Is all
And let the light gather around me
Ms. Sayaka.
You haven't been getting enough sleep, have you? You look tired.
I'm not joking!
What is it, all of a sudden?
I'm all right.
Kobato?
Nothing you have to worry about.
After she's had some rest and feels settled, feed her something that digests well.
She's okay.
If you put on long faces like that, Ms. Sayaka is going to worry.
Get over it already.
She would have much more peace of mind knowing
Oh of course. You're right. But...
I'll be back from work as soon as I can.
Ms. Sayaka.
Yes.
Huh?
knowing that I could count on you and Fujimoto.
Okay.
Don't be clumsy and stumble on your way.
No, never mind.
I'm worried about an illness!
I tried folding one-thousand cranes with everybody.
I certainly hope so.
so it's not too hard on your stomach even when you're sick.
I was trying... to make rice porridge.
Mmm, delicious.
W-Well that's true, but...
I wonder why.
Is because he
In that case
It's going to be tough sweeping tomorrow morning.
And we sell it and use the money for the school.
1 2 3! No aizu de ryoute hirogete
I'll go and sweep out front now!
Bye-bye!
It's a puppy!
Don't you think you're being unkind to cats and dogs?
Have some tea.
Sure! I'll make something too.
And because I'm going to be the big sister, I'll come to pick her up!
You are a bad man so I tell you nothing!
I don't care if children are attending.
F-Fujimoto! Were you listening?
I overheard you talking to yourself in that big voice of yours!
I wasn't talking to myself...
Huh?
Someone you know?
It's a mascot!
Then, you plan to mass-produce that mysterious life form?!
I'll bring you something that will surely sell.
Don't fall down, okay?
I will not! I refuse to fall down!
Don't get your hopes up too high.
but other customers will be showing up soon, I'm sure.
Really?
Because we all, all the children worked very hard on this!
Can I get an iced coffee?
Here you are.
So well I said, "Hey, I'll check it out later,"
Squish?
But when will "someday" come?
Don't you get it?!
Does nothing seem wrong to you about my appearance?!
Um... well...
Figure it out!
I said that but do I have something in mind?
I've been waiting for you. Thanks.
Oh, by the way...
Well the hairy part is a bit much, but if you're careful, you can get used to it.
Yeah, to us it was like a bad dream.
It does.
Now let me see...
Hey quit that!
Dryers are a lot harder on the body than I expected.
Wh-Why this is...
Here you go!
Daddy, I want that blue puppy!
Let me try!
Oh no!
Let me give it a try!
Domoto! Thank you for taking the time to come!
You're very welcome. I had a wonderful time.
I'm so glad!
But I would have had a better time if you handed me my purchases directly.
I had a horrible day.
Oh well, I guess we'll just have to go back to the kindergarten to get it.
Oh, the baumkuchen. That sold immediately.
Th-Then! I'll give you this cute rabbit that I especially made so you can feel better!
It really is the dead of winter, isn't it?
Na no ni
Doko ni aru no?
You have got to fill this bottle with kompeito by spring.
He was sleeping with his stomach uncovered.
I haven't stepped one foot in.
This is harassment.
Leave him.
That's three...
Um...
But I'm going to go and ask him.
Kobato!
And then guess what?
We went on picnics too!
It's full of it! So please!
His father?
Hm?
The operation was successful.
Oh good.
That guy you put in front of the kindergarten...
Appendicitis?
He's at Central Hospital.
What is it?
I'll walk you home.
What's wrong?
Fujimoto was angry with me.
Kobato...
Just getting home?
Sure.
Ureshikuttemo namida ga deru nante
I'm sure he will.
Oww...
Is all
They say my dreams will come true someday
I surprise myself
If you don't mind, that is.
Well, thanks to the bazaar, there was enough money to buy new toys. Hmm...
Can I see you again tomorrow?
I see.
I have to work tonight. Besides, Christmas...
Mother!
Yes.
Yes.
He's really something.
Yes.
You're Santa, aren't you?
Thank you!
Thank you very much, Santa!
I mean, it's Christmas and all...
Always taking advantage of me.
I just think about him.
Go, please. I'll cover for you here.
You did nothing wrong.
Huh?
I never was mad at you...
My heart shimmers with the light
Light shining brightly above the clouds
Accidentally lost his shadow somewhere
And you laugh and reply, "Thank you"
Demo "itsuka" tte dore kurai?
Doko ni aru no?
Don't kindergartens have Valentine parties?
I mean, Ms. Sayaka...
I went by this morning and they said that I could work
for everyone at the kindergarten to make chocolate with.
until Valentine's Day.
Well at least we didn't fall in some place like the middle of the ocean this time.
Yes. I see.
Ioryogi-san!
Yeah.
That's wrong! How could you even think that?!
You do.
How do you differentiate your gender? By color?
Off we go!
Don't even ask me. I refuse.
What?
Yumi, who's the boy?
Oh, apparently someone Kobato knows.
I'm pretty good at pretending to be a stuffed doll.
I did it!
Um...
But...
Yes, we worked as poster Moconas!
What the heck is that?
Oh, well...
What?!
I hope that next time,
Looks more like a starfish.
Seriously, you're running out of time.
Yes ma'am!
I'll be over later to help.
Okay!
Huh? Huh?
I'm fine. I'm more worried about him.
Thank you very much!
She knows how to be considerate, unlike you.
Then I'll help!
Right now you need to be wary of everyone.
I couldn't find any information.
My umbrella's gone.
What?
Shut up Katsuragi, you fool!
Thank you very much!
Floor markings on my cheek?!
Ioryogi?
Huh? Be quiet! Keep it to yourself!
S-Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
No. The floor mark is already gone.
Huh?
Has Fujimoto been giving you a hard time?
Couples share one umbrella.
Thank you so very much!
What good does it do you if you're the one getting the healing?
Well that was because...
That was because...
She's not my girlfriend or anything.
Mutsumi. Come on.
What are you waiting for? Let's go!
Wait for me! Can't you see I'm getting wet?!
Don't walk so close to me.
Let's go.
Oh! Are you okay, Ioryogi-san?!
You're mean, Ioryogi-san!
Everyone dreams of flying
But they let gravity trick them
Please tell me what I can do
Who did you give that to?
Huh?
You can make a kindergarten anywhere.
What the heck are you saying?!
If that's the case though, you're defeating your own purpose.
I'll close down the kindergarten.
What are you up to now, Dobato?
You're...
The boss?
so that the previous principal would have to pay that back.
in order to protect the kindergarten from the boss.
Let's find wonderful things today
Bon appetite!
I understand. I guess it's difficult to get in the mood to have dinner with others right now.
He's the one that's telling us at the kindergarten to leave.
Maybe if I follow him, he'll lead me to Mr. Okiura.
Meeting him won't do you any good. Go home.
Of course I'm cold.
If you care so much about Ms. Sayaka, why do you do things to hurt her like that?!
After what you've done, I cannot think of you as a good man.
You truly care about her.
What?
So, Ms. Sayaka, you have to be with him.
Hurry!
Suki na toki ni utaitai dake
Zenshin ni hikari wo atsumete
Nan juu kai koronde naite
It's kind of tough without Fujimoto's help, isn't it?
You know, you don't have to push yourself by taking on additional shifts.
Yes.
Um, would you please drop by the kindergarten once?
Watch where you're going!
But?
It hurts right here.
Fujimoto, is it?
Oh, brother. I don't believe it.
Are you working today, too?
Yeah. I'll be back by night.
Now get that look off of your face.
Keep going, keep going, keep going...
Kobato.
What's the matter?
Teacher, can we start?
Okay now, let's move back so we don't get hurt.
Okay!
That's right. We'll take Ushagi-san hostage, and then persuade him.
It's not about how heavy or light things are.
Right?
Something terrible has happened!
Sorry Kobato.
What do you think we should do?
No... Just one will do!
Anata no egao ochiteita no
Semete tsutsumitai
You know it's very early.
Even the most obvious of things
And sing whenever I want
I'll do it myself!
I'm going to work.
I've told you time and again. If it's sympa...
To where we can have fun.
What are you trying to do?
Right here, on your face.
This is amazing!
That's not what I'm talking about!
That's right! She's forgotten about her wish and is fooling around, absentmindedly.
I have not forgotten.
Or could you say the same for residents of Ikai?
Fujimoto!
Oh good. I found you.
Why? Well, I...
And I never will.
Right.
It's been a year now since you came here.
Yes. When I settle down.
Ioryogi-san, sorry to keep you waiting.
Isn't it hard to just be with someone, without really doing anything?
Wait a minute!
Don't make her... disappear...
Fujimoto?
I'm sorry.
It's not a life, just a peaceful existence.
Fujimoto's... Kompeito...
Atsumeta mono no hazama ni
Anata no soba de warau yo,
Atatameru dake de mo ii no kana
The bottle is filling up.
About going to the place she wants to go.
Goodbye.
Ureshii toki waratte
Oh my.
Sorry. That was an awkward thing to say.
Yeah.
I also heard you haven't been taking notes lately. What's up?
It's nothing.
I'm thinking about rebuilding Yomogi Kindergarten.
He's been worried about you. You seem to lack spirit at school.
Right, Fujimoto?
What is going on?!
Over many, many years, I have repeatedly had sad partings with Shuichiro.
Thank you very much.
Impressive.
Fujimoto, it's for you.
The problem is that the family had been there for generations,
You're from the lawyer's office, are you?
Every time I think of this
Precious thoughts spread across in my heart
Uh... Are you all right?
Fujimoto!
Sekai no oku no The depths of the Earth
Kagirinai yasashisa Are filled with endless kindness
When this bottle is filled, my wish will come true and I'll finally be able to go there.
Then let's go get them!
Ah, I forgot to say something.
Eh? Why's that?
Stuffed animals can't speak here,
Why can't they speak?
Just get going!
Nobody's heart would be healed by that.
I see...
You're giving this... to me?
What a wonderful person you are!
Thanks! You saved me!
Here you go! Wonderful tissues!
Here!
I'm sorry!
He's...
Are you all right?
Hey,
My name is Kobato Hanato!
Play the organ!
Yes!
Hey, Mr. Kiyokazu, come play the organ!
Kobato too!
Kobato is funny!
Since he can't talk, I'll have to go get him or else I'll be in big trouble!
If you can.
Do you think just knowing your name is enough?
Yes?
Do you have any idea what would have happened if someone took me?!
Would you forget the bottle too?!
The bottle?
In fact...
That's...
Do you like swings?
She's at work.
And she's really nice! Really!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really! She's a great mom!
That's wonderful.
Does something hurt?
It's from that Toshihiko kid.
Right!
I can't slack off just because it's raining!
That was close.
I'm Kobato Hanato.
I will.
Thanks for everything!
Looks like Sayaka hasn't changed. She's always worrying about others.
Kobato.
I-I hope you're looking forward to it!
Thanks!
Where did he go?
Dobato...!
She's a lot more considerate than you are.
I loved it! There's a roof, and it's really relaxing!
Sorry, but I'm cleaning right now.
Hey, that's not fair! You don't even have to get wet!
All right.
It was probably on purpose.
You again?
What did you say?!
I can't believe it made a mark on my face!
Morning!
Huh?
when I went to the cake shop to apologize for the umbrella,
I'm Mutsumi Tadokoro.
Don't let it get to you!
What?
But if he does bully you, just let me know.
I'll give him a beating.
O-Okay!
I've got something to do after this.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yes.
About Mutsumi.
What's going on?
I just wanted you to cheer up...
S-Shut up! I said I don't care!
Come on.
Ralph!!
I can't help it. It's a small umbrella.
I just wanted her to cheer up...
Really?
No, it's nothing, Shuichiro.
And they gave me some fluffy warm bedding.
Kompeito in the bottle.
Little birds are singing.
Look! What a pretty little street!
Because the fresh leaves are so pretty, perhaps?
Do I know you?
My name is Kobato Hanato.
Are you the Kohaku from Tenkai?
It's Ioryogi-san.
Oh, you scared me.
Kobato!
I'm trying to understand the reason behind Kohaku's tears.
I overslept!
Ioryogi-san?
When would be a good time to approach her?
Uh no, you're not getting the point.
It's beautiful.
Kobato?!
It's just that whenever I see something beautiful,
I see.
You have no idea.
Is there something that is troubling you?
Amusement parks cost money.
Huh?
You're delivering newspapers?
Yeah.
It's a toy alligator I got from spinning the wheel.
May I have these tickets?
Then won't you consider exchanging these for Mr. Alligator?
Please use these on your date with Shuichiro.
You're delivering newspapers so that you could get those tickets?
Besides, I can't be asking favors.
What?
You were listening, right?
Juuryoku ni damasareterunda
Issho ni iru kara
Ureshikuttemo namida ga deru nante
I was even given a soft and fluffy mattress...
And there's konpeito in my bottle!
At this rate, it'll take you a hundred years to fill that bottle.
Yup!
Bye.
Just watch me clean it up in the blink of an eye!
I want to know why Kohaku was crying.
I'll heal her heart if she's hurt!
If you barge in now, you'll just get in their way.
Gather in order to help these lives.
Wow, how beautiful...
I'm really sorry.
Oh...
And the times when I see him smile shyly...
Kohaku, is there anything bothering you?
Let me see...
First, I must investigate this so-called amusement park!
Here you go.
I-I'm sorry!
You deliver newspapers?
Wow, so hardworking...
Hey.
Whatever...
What's with those newspapers?
With Ioryogi...
Shuichiro, you'll go with me?
He's a messenger from heaven.
No, I don't.
Negative.
Yes?
Ehhh, really?
Hello, this is Yomogi Nursery.
Dobato! Whaddaya think you're doing right now?!
I'll try my best so I can read better!
It's the guy from earlier.
Is there something you need?
We came to get our money back.
What do you think you're doing?
Don't you dare touch the kids.
I believe I've asked you not to come to this place during school hours anymore.
The one at fault is the one who can't pay back her loans, isn't it teach?
I don't have time to play with children!
Let go, dammit!
Toshihiko! Are you all right?
I was faking it, I'm fine!
Well done!
Toshihiko's amazing!
Do you feel sick?
There's nothing wrong, really.
Huh?! Really?
And so, he came to forget the fact that he was a firefly at all.
I don't have time.
Yes, yes.
Back then, I was so busy, had so many deadlines...
That's why I also changed the story to be a beautiful, but sad one.
Naoko! Naoko! Hold on!
Yeah, it's me.
Please wait!
Naoko... stood here and drew this.
Thank you!
You better keep up your pace!
Yes?
Fujimoto, Kobato, you guys aren't missing anything either, right?
I see.
No, I mean, this is Yomogi Nursery!
Don't tell Miss Sayaka about the phone call.
But he seemed like a scary person, and...
Now I have a boo-boo.
Don't cause Miss Sayaka unnecessary worry.
And your look is how many times more pathetic than mine?
Thanks. I owe you one.
Kobato?
This is all I get as a souvenir?
Where is everybody?
The person who's "it" needs to find all the hidden people!
Toshihiko and Yoshio, I found you!
And over there! And there!
Come, let's get going.
I'll go look for her.
Are you talking about our game of hide-and-seek?
Everyone, get ready!
Kobato, look it, look it!
That's Genko for you.
What did you say bird brain?!
Oh! I have something for you, Ioryogi!
The ones who tricked him were pretty dangerous guys,
Kobato fell again!
I'll help you! Please let me help out!
Why can't we tell Miss Sayaka about it?
What's the matter, Kobato?
Really! Don't be sad!
He's not here.
Excuse me?
I'll keep trying!
Sorry! Are you all right?
What a cute stuffed animal. Here you go.
He was just here...
But! I think he gets angry a little too often...
We know!
Maybe he's in the library?
That's not true.
I'm sorry. Neither Fujimoto nor Kobato are here today, you guys must be bored.
Chitose... What's the matter?
If someone he likes, like you, could put in a good word for me first...
Thank you very much.
At what?
I guess.
I'm sorry, Chitose.
You guys cut class, didn't you? I don't like helping people who do that.
It's just that I can't say the right thing.
Like how you're so nice.
Kiyokazu's not afraid of people hating him. He's a strong person.
Ah! I said something strange, didn't I?
Domoto!
Kobato! 30 points!
What! No!
He's just awkward. That was him trying his hardest to thank you.
Look, Ioryogi! Such a cute kitty!
Don't you go causing trouble for people again!
I mean! It's not for me!
It looks like he likes it.
So cute!
Come here for a second.
Yuzuru, you're allergic to cats, aren't you?
It's means you get rashes or sneeze,
I can't continue causing trouble for everyone!
Agreed.
Right! Excuse us!
You're working so hard; it just makes us want to help you.
Oh, that's...
Okay! Thank you!
Those children are working so hard too...
It was Fujimoto.
He isn't allergic to cats either.
I'm sure Chiho and Chise feel the same way.
Where are you going?
Kobato?
That's right... The night I met that grandma, there was a full moon just like there is tonight.
There were beautiful cherry blossoms in bloom.
This song...
They're what make my hands...
Yes! Fujimoto found someone for us.
But...
Watermelon breaking!
A letter.
What did I tell you?
I might not be able to go this year...
Really?
Yomogi Nursery is on break today.
Ioryogi!
Wow, you know a lot.
Officially, this is an announcement from the beginning of second semester.
At this time, I would like to present her with a certificate of appreciation from the prefecture.
You really are a natural at it!
Really?
I didn't feel like going home by myself anyway so I'm glad you did.
I'm sorry Nat, I overslept! Go ahead without me?
Sorry Nat, you can go ahead.
Thank you. It looks like we'll make it on time for the festival.
Don't worry about it, I'm all finished.
What about the camera you were using yesterday?
Yesterday?
We always have so much to talk about!
Do you not... talk to Natsuki anymore?
Okay!
Maybe when you get better at taking pictures!
When you get back, let's try it out!
Yukino worked really hard at her part time job to buy a good camera.
Yeah, you were finally able to buy your dream camera!
Yukino?
I just... like photography and cameras. That's all.
What happened to it?
I just have to say something to her!
What happened?
Thank you so much, Kobato!
I... think I might've been afraid of Yukino.
Yukino's changed, little by little, from the way she used to be.
and I was really afraid of getting left behind.
Chase after those white, white clouds.
What are you doing this early on a Sunday morning?
Ioryogi! Are you okay?
Chitose just said goodbye to Fujimoto, right?
Where are you going?
Miss Sayaka!
It really is a nice day out today...
If you don't have the resolve to see it all the way through, don't get involved.
...he said stuff like that.
He looks like he's angry in this picture.
He wouldn't speak to anyone.
Bye bye! See you tomorrow!
Bye bye, Miss Sayaka! See you tomorrow!
Come now, no fighting.
Really?
Yay!
You just hit her with the ball!
It's okay. It just got a little hurt.
from the top of the great mountains.
Yes. He says he's going to become a lawyer.
Then tomorrow everyone can take a nap with Mr. Sunshine!
Phew. Then I'm looking forward to tomorrow!
But, but, I wanted to air out the futons and help out the Nursery!
Fujimoto, you were really cute when you were little!
We want to hear!
See you on Monday!
Is there anything else I can help with?
'Cause you wanna help pay back even just a little of the nursery's debt, right?
Well then...
Oh... well then...
Poor doll.
Kobato is a tenant at my apartment and she always helps out at Yomogi Nursery.
I finished changing.
And now, what should I do to help?
Welcome!
Thank you very much! Right?
Yup.
Uhh...
An apple pie and a lemon tart. And a cream puff.
Then when you're all finished...
Thank you as well, Miss Cheerful Shop Attendant.
Was that okay?
Yup. Once you get used to it, I'm sure you'll be great.
Hello there.
Thank you very much!
I'm just thinking about the manager...
About the manager?
Yomogi Nursery is having a problem paying back its loans.
That's so nice of you...
Good morning!
Could you just casually ask him what's the matter then?
What are you doing here?
Miss Sayaka's... husband?
I'm being a detective for today and...
Detective?
Anything at all?
I'll do my own dragnet.
Hello!
Kobato, it's fine, we should stop.
Huh?
Is this... a date?
I was actually... interviewing...
and I was thinking that you got injured because of that...
I like seeing the happy faces of the customers who come and buy Tirol's cakes,
Really?
It's chocolate from the store that I'm working at now.
Could you possibly be worrying about me?
Hey, come on now. Give me a break.
Huh?
I know.
are the humans of the human world.
But...
Wash your hands and go inside.
I thought it would be a good idea for you to come to today's seminar so I came by to get you.
Oh, it's for college?
Yup.
Miss Sayaka...
That's when I noticed it.
But...
Bye for now!
Little... Ioryogi...?
Why do you plan on staying in that form here in the human world for so long?
Zuisho! Don't be flapping around inside!
You'll get feathers in the batter!
Those two spell big trouble!
No one would be able to get between them.
Pathetic, aren't you.
Without that, Kobato...
Ginsei...
You're welcome!
Ioryogi!
Thank you so much for finding Ioryogi!
What were you doing?! Why did you let your bottle get stolen like that?!
Ioryogi and I have always been together!
Ioryogi?
Ioryogi, it's fall!
It's the smell of fall!
Huh? Smell of fall?
Um...
And how many seasons are left?
That was Ioryogi's voice, but Ioryogi isn't here...
Are you an idiot?!
He didn't even say he was leaving; it was really unusual.
I got it! If toys are the problem, I know a nice place we could go!
Yeah.
I guess our adult worries were carried over to them.
Right! Smiles are they key, smiles!
It looks like light caught on fire.
Ioryogi?
But truth is, there are a lot more humans who appreciate new things over old, y'know?
Were you also worried about this ginkgo tree?
Old things are in trouble because of redevelopment.
Oh, this fence wasn't here yet yesterday...
You're unhappy, aren't you? That everyone's saying things like that tree is unnecessary.
It's all right, Kobato.
Hey!
I know a wisteria tree who has lived for about as long as this ginkgo tree.
It's a little heart-rending, but very gentle.
Why were you just standing there looking confused?!
The middle is hollow.
Kohaku, was the ginkgo tree happy?
Ioryogi?
It must have been really happy at its end, you know?
Not really.
Let's play leaf pictures together!
If you stick ginkgo leaves on him, you get a Ginkgofujimotian!
Firefly's Light...
Even the most obvious of things
They say my dreams will come true someday
I can't wait forever
Please tell me what I can do
Dobato! It's not time to be fooling around.
Hey.
I'm Kobato Hanato! And this is Ioryogi-san!
Go on, eat it! I like little kids.
Hurry and pay up!
Please leave!
We don't have time to be playing games with brats like you!
Toshihiko, you were great!
There he is again. What's he doing?
Are you not feeling well?
Um...
Oh, I borrowed this from the kindergarten.
Oh...
I can glow, just like you.
You came!
Yeah, not that I really wanted to.
Those were the exact words that Naoko said to me.
I don't have time.
Sotaro?
She wanted so badly to see them with me.
There's more!
Wow! Thank you so very much!
Fifty's more like it.
Wow!
So cool!
Do... Dobato!
Hey.
Are you here by yourself?
No, I'll be okay! I can carry them all by myself!
What?
The house we lived in before. Mom changed jobs, so we had to move...
Is that where you're headed to now?
Nope, your face clearly says that you've forgotten.
Mom would always bake snacks for me...
Fujimoto!
Which way is it? Right? Left?
That's a pretty complex term you know.
Pears.
I guess we have no choice then but to break it.
And he always makes me eat the things I hate...
I apologized to the lady at the farm for you.
Can you really get back all by yourself?
Grandpa...
Grandpa!
Come, we're going home!
Your Mom's waiting at home for you too.
Right!
I've got something I need to do, so I'll be going ahead.
We went potato picking with the Nursery today.
I see.
I bet this one is from that kid.
But then he was able to understand his Grandfather's feelings.
I see.
Shush!
Thank you.
You didn't get very much sleep, did you?
Now see here.
and I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm fine.
Please open the door!
Kobato?
How is she?
it won't be long before her condition is much worse than just collapsing.
Right.
That doctor.
What's the matter?
She'll get better soon. Even the doctor said so.
That Kobato, she completely forgot about me.
If you silently stay by her side like that, do you think Miss Sayaka will get better?
What are you folding over there, Toshihiko?
Please teach me how to fold cranes too!
Kobato, I mean.
What's up? Why the formality?
Hm?
What about the children?
Huh?
I'm not a space case!
What she said was right.
I know.
Okay.
Mama's at the neighborhood association meeting right now.
Shuichiro said the same thing!
But how should I make that...
I was trying to make rice porridge...
Some people really do die just because of some tiny, little thing.
something heavy that had been twisted up inside of me seemed to come loose and...
Our thousand cranes must have worked!
Cleaning up tomorrow morning is going to be difficult.
It's where everyone brings all sorts of things,
Bazaar!
Let's do it, let's have a bazaar!
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?
Oh! Ah, thank you for your work today, Kobato.
Congratulations!
You are... ?
I'm shutting down the Nursery.
Even if there are still kids there.
Even though he looks kind, there's something scary about him!
Fujimoto!
Don't tell Miss Sayaka that he came here.
Then that person is Miss Sayaka's husband?!
More importantly, you have something you need to do, don't you?
You sound like Fujimoto again! That's so mean!
At all!
There you go, falling.
The customers aren't coming, are they?
I'm going to tell everyone that the bazaar hasn't been canceled!
Kobato...
She said she'd bring people, so at the very least I'll go and prepare coffee.
Y-Yes.
I wonder if there are any treasures to be found?
It's a success, isn't it?
Mr. Kiyokazu, iced coffee!
I'll bring something that'll sell really well.
Here.
I was abused terribly by a selfish shopkeeper.
We were so close then!
T-That's terrible! You're the only one who gets to be something cute?! No fair!
Well anyway, absolutely do not, on any account, start any trouble!
You got it?
That's weird...
I'm not edible!
Oh no, water's dangerous.
Where am I?
No, no, no, I can't. This is to slowly savor later.
Welcome to Mokona Land!
What's he doing?
That one, right?
You mean me?!
This time I'll definitely...
That's strange... All right, next time I'll definitely!
At least I've come this far
Even if you face difficulties, you can't give up.
U-Uh, I'm sorry!
I had a lot of fun and got a lot of stuff.
None of them have sold...
Well, of course not.
Thank you!
No, I'm going to savor the taste and feast on it!
It's winter, I suppose.
That's right. There isn't much time left until spring! Do you understand?
You need to fill up this bottle with konpeito by spring.
Right...
He's that debt collector from last time.
I like this one! I wanna hang it up!
If you're looking for Fujimoto and Kobato, they're on the roof.
Why does he want to do something so terrible?
I... I'm going to go talk to that man!
But!
And also!
What?
Don't touch me!
Shut up... go away!
Appendicitis? I see.
Yes.
There's no way you can return the money after all, right?
Is there any chance we could talk about it?
What's the matter? This isn't like you.
What?
I'll walk you.
Domoto.
Thank you for today.
You're kind and honest and you always work your very hardest.
Kobato.
It's so warm.
On Christmas...
Are you going home now?
Oh yeah. If there's anything else you need for the Christmas party, let me know.
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry!
What are you doing, Yuzuru?
Making sure we can fit a ton of presents under the tree!
Kobato.
You haven't made up with Kizokazu yet?
I see.
It's not your fault.
Do you think I could see you tomorrow as well?
Huh?
But... it's cold outside!
I made this for you, Ioryogi! Here you go!
Fujimoto, you too!
Hm?
I'm sure it's because I did something I shouldn't have...
Yes.
Santa, are you Mr. Kiyokazu?
Thank you!
Shut it. Christmas is the busiest time of the year!
Merry Christmas!
What are you doing?
Kobato?
Why...
Anyway... just don't worry about it.
If you leave the window open like that, you'll catch a cold.
You can't hold Valentine's parties at nurseries?
I've also taken on some late night construction work...
Yeah.
Thank you for waiting!
Is there anything else I could help out with?
At least we didn't land in the sea this time, right?
We don't know if this is a world where white, meat bun-like things can speak!
I'm Fai, and this is Syaoran.
Yeah, really.
If you're in a pinch...
But...
Syaoran, why don't you go with her?
She's always been waiting for me, even though I'm unsure when I can return again.
Welcome back!
Thank you.
Those people were...
Yeah.
It was supposed to be a star, but...
You have to give your best chocolate to the person you like best on Valentine's Day, after all!
What is it?
I'm sorry there are so many to tie up.
Kiyokazu?
He is not!
It seems like there's a lot of stuff going on above us too.
Please.
Master Genko! That's so mean! Starting without me...
Teach! After the clean up's done, entrance will be prohibited.
See ya.
Fujimoto really worked so hard...
Because Fujimoto worked too hard.
That's not my place.
Hello, I'm back.
He said he didn't want to worry you.
Um... your arm...
I'm sure it's inconvenient not being to use one hand.
When I first met you at Yomogi Nursery...
You're wrong...
I'm sure you're a big help!
It costs money...
I'll do my best to row!
Don't put the oars in too deep.
Here we go.
Do you know what sort of situation you're in right now?!
Kobato has chosen, hasn't she?
I was just thinking that you and Ioryogi are so alike!
What?
Yes.
If you don't gather the rest of the konpeito, you'll! i know you said not to use these but it looks really funny with just an !
Shall we go then?
Don't... get rid of her.
Because of her contract.
That's... a stuffed animal...
Kobato chose to spend her remaining time with you instead of fulfilling her contract.
It's so warm...
Damn it!
I must go to the place I should be at.
Without a tenant, even a room can get empty, you know?
You're such a bully...
What's going on?
Do you understand?
With our souls as one, we will be called together again and again, as long as time continues.
Of that, I'm sure.
Good luck with everything.
Right.
Up until now...
From now on... till the end of time.
we have no choice but to stay here and just grumble over our baumkuchen.
A full 100 points to the mighty Ioryogi.
Do you have your lunch, water bottle, and snacks?
Kobato, are you all right?
Dou sureba iin dakke?
Suki na toki ni utaitai dake
We're all going on a picnic now!
Who are you?
Where's Sayaka? I'd like to speak to her.
I'm not extending the repayment deadline.
I'm shutting down the kindergarten.
You be sure and tell that to Sayaka.
Said he's shutting down the kindergarten.
Kobato! Fujimoto! We're leaving!
I have no lesson to learn!
They hear you talking like that and you're not getting away with being a toy doll!
What the heck brings you here today?
you used to brag about?
Watch your words!
So there is something.
If you find it you can be happy.
It's that little girl.
Don't you forget, we still haven't had our deciding match.
Not yet! I'm it right now!
Oh, Masao! I found you!
Oh?
Marina!
Did you find her?
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find one.
What now?
A four-leaf clover.
Here you are.
Oh no!
Hey! Good on him!
Your form doesn't quite suit your cool smile.
Who's in big trouble?
Hey.
It's a Baumkuchen.
I have something for you, Ioryogi-san!
It's a four leaf clover of happiness.
It's a little shriveled, but I found some happiness for you, too!
Dare mo honto wa toberunda yo
Ureshikuttemo namida ga deru nante
Yes, Ioryogi?
From here on, your wish will or will not be granted depending on how well you do.
It's fun!
I have a place I want to go to.
I'm going to miss the bus...
I'm going to...
The crows have their eyes on...
You should change your name to Dobato!
Hitting on her, huh.
Right, Fujimoto?
Whatever, I don't care.
What's the matter, Ms. Sayaka?
Sorry, Boss! There's an emergency...
Okay, no problem.
This is what hell looks like.
He's always like this at night.
She's working hard so she can support her child.
Please do.
and the endless sky of Summer
are both brilliantly engraved into my heart...
Please guide me,
It's the sound of the wind resonating.
These are the things we both hold in our hands.
Umm, I...
It seems like he stopped crying.
They were thank you gifts for singing. Accepting them was the right thing to do.
So, the test...
It's the first time he's been so happy from listening to someone other than his mother sing.
Your singing was beautiful.
Why can't they speak?
Because they're stuffed animals.
All right, I'll do my best!
Kick the can!
Um... excuse me...
What a wonderful person you are!
I'm sure they'll be useful!
Yes?
Would it help to have more workers?
I guess so.
What's his name?
What is it?
Um...
Play the organ!
Fine. Go home.
No!
Kobato too!
Oh, is that so.
The children looked like they were really having fun too.
I'm trying to find that out myself...
But, we won't really be able to pay you...
No! Just being able to help out is a good enough payment for me!
And?
What do you wanna do?
That's...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everyone says she's a bad mom.
That she's a poor mother.
Really! She's a great mom!
Yes! She's a great mom.
No.
Swing, Kobato!
You get 100 points.
Keep up the good work, Kobato!
But still!
I can't slack off just because it's raining!
Kobato, huh?
If you're ever in need of something, don't hesitate to ask.
I have to get back to the nursery.
I'll stop by later to help out.
U-Umm...
This is all I have!
Y-Yes?
I have to hurry!
What do you want me to do?
Right!
I live right around the corner.
Shut up!
Get back here!
You'll hit me either way!
Oh?
I bet Miss Chitose thinks I'm a total freak!
Well,
Ioryogi was really thankful too.
Kind of a weird name, don't you think?
W-Where is it sticking up?
Well, I've got morning practice. Later!
Do you carry an umbrella, Kobato?
Just call me Mutsumi.
Mutsumi looked really sad.
Please!
I want you to share an umbrella with Mutsumi too!
Here!
Kobato?!
Come on.
Wait up!
You're going to get me soaked!
Really?
What's strange?
Even if it takes me a hundred years, I'll still do my best!
That's not true!
I'm sorry.
Really?
Beats me.
She's not here.
I hope you had a good day at work.
There she is!
I learned it from the magazines at the convenience store!
Yeah?
And the patients are more important.
I'm sorry for barging in.
I get a tight feeling in my chest.
The satisfied feeling I get whenever I'm with him...
And?
Like going to the amusement park with the person you like.
It looks really fun.
But I don't have any...
You know, Kohaku is...
It's you!
What's that?
Please!
Yup!
...considered selfish?
Shuichiro, you'll go with me?
Should you really be happy?!
Kobato, you skipped a page again!
She messed up again, didn't she?
Hello, this is Yomogi Nursery.
She knocked something over again!
Bye bye!
It'd be nice if you could actually read the picture book!
I suppose.
Hey.
Money?
Come on!
What do you think you're doing?
You have no money.
Are you an idiot?!
Do you feel sick?
Is there anything I could do to help?
I've been practicing, but it just seems like I can't get the hang of reading out loud.
Why not?
I was told not to read this book anymore by a man in the park...
And so, he came to forget the fact that he was a firefly at all.
One moonless, pitch black night, that firefly saw a small, beautiful light.
"You're so pretty. What sort of bug are you?" He asked.
And then she asked him, "Why don't you glow?"
What do you think you're doing?
I'll be waiting at the Hachiman Mountain riverside!
The firefly remembered.
You've gotten good at reading that, haven't you?
Miss... Naoko?
I'll be waiting by the Hachiman Mountain riverside!
This is...
You can't write a story about something if you don't see the real thing.
There aren't any fireflies in this area, are there?
Does everyone have everything?
Yes!
Right!
Hello, this is Kobato Hanato!
Actually, we're all about to go out on a field trip right now.
You're an interesting one.
Ioryogi?
Him, huh.
He even decided that stuff for you?
Whatever, that aside, what'd you come here for?
Woah!
Now I have a boo-boo.
Kobato, you've been getting hurt all morning.
Have the investigation skills you were so proud of gone rusty?
Then as you wish, an extra large fireball coming right up!
Kobato! Marina!
It's been a while, Ginsei.
It's that girl, isn't it?
She hasn't even found one person yet...
Miss Sayaka, please stay here with everybody.
Marina!
I'll go look over there.
Don't worry about it.
I'm happy because you tried so hard to cheer me up.
I'm glad!
I found one!
Hey! Let's try taking that picture again!
That's Genko for you.
What did you say bird brain?!
Oh no! Ioryogi's so small, I hope he didn't get stuck somewhere!
Or get crushed somewhere!
Ioryogi!
Oh! I have something for you, Ioryogi!
If things keep going like this, sooner or later, Yomogi Nursery is going to get shut down.
Well, I can't say your lack of common sense really surprises me anymore.
There are... There are so many people!
One two, one two!
No, no, not at all! That would help me out a lot!
Great.
Fujimoto's always so busy.
I got it, I got it. I'll help.
Well, let's go.
Well, he's not too friendly, and he always looks like he's angry about something.
It's fine!
If there's anything you could do, Professor Tomita.
Definitely! I wish I could help everyone, but I just can't seem to get the hang of it...
I see! That's why she went to college.
R-Right... ?
I want to help protect the Yomogi Nursery that me, Chiho, and Chise went to.
You're so mean!
About what?
In a way that would purposely make people angry?
Huh? But you listen to everyone's requests and help them out!
i1You guys cut class, didn't you? I don't like helping people who do that.
I don't know Fujimoto very well, but being feared makes you lonely.
Being hated is painful.
You're a strange girl, aren't you.
About this afternoon...
I said you were helpful.
He's nice! When I lost the key to my house, he found it for me!
Same thing.
If you don't have the resolve to see it all the way through, don't get involved.
It's Kobato!
It looks like he likes it.
It'd be nice if we could find someone who would take him in...
I'll go to Yomogi Nursery and ask Miss Sayaka tomorrow!
So cute!
I wanna hold him too!
Yuzuru!
then you're the same as the owner who abandoned him.
Fujimoto didn't mean any harm either.
Yes. I'm sorry about this.
You're right...
Chiho! Chise!
then you're the same as the owner who abandoned him.
I need to do my best at everything I can!
It's this darling, isn't it?
There, there.
Isn't that great, Milk?
I'll be going then.
And then... I sang a song for him.
What kind of song was it?
What do you want?
He has a very good owner now thanks to you.
We were able to find someone to take in the kitty!
I see.
And it's that desire that allowed you to reassure them.
The beach!
Watermelon breaking!
Hey, are you listening, Dobato?!
and continue to heal people's wounded hearts!
Hey hey, I've kinda learned how to swim!
Oh no. I really need to go.
Yomogi Nursery is on break today.
No I'm not!
No I don't.
It's a large all girl's school. It's Sayaka and Chitose's alma mater.
You were going to return this, weren't you?
The girl who tripped is in the same class too.
Wow, great shot!
Those on duty for pool clean up, please assemble by the pool.
You over there! Hurry up and go call an administrator!
Ah. That girl.
I'm Kobato Hanato.
Yuki!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Well... Yukino keeps avoiding me.
I'm sorry we're late!
Even if you just come and learn with us...
I've finally saved up some money and I can go buy a camera at the sale tomorrow!
so I've been working for a long time to save up money.
It's a hobby I started with just a cell phone camera, but I've really fallen in love with it.
I wonder why they can't.
Yeah, totally!
Right?
So a lot of people are mistaken about good photography.
Natsuki!
I just have to say something to her!
Yukino's changed, little by little, from the way she used to be.
You just managed to scrape through.
Such pretty fireworks!
That's strange.
When I was talking to him, he was next door. Now he's already out the door.
Where are you going?
I'm going to go air out the futons for them because it's such a nice day!
I know, but I came to air out the futons.
Chitose's really glad she managed to get such a good tenant like you to stay at her place, Kobato.
Has he been... picking on you?
Kiyokazu, this is my daughter, Sayaka.
Here we go.
Even me. He was always by himself...
Can I get one?
Here you go!
My bad.
I didn't think you'd actually fall.
Stop messing around!
Whatever, just hurry up and get the ball!
You're the one who missed the pass.
Damn... Why is it so wet here?
We did not.
What're you so angry for?
You can see everything,
from the top of the great mountains.
Did you know that Fujimoto is doing all sorts of part time work right now?
They're so fluffy and smell so fresh!
D-Did I say something strange?
Okay! I'll see you tomorrow!
It's Kiyokazu!
But, but, I wanted to air out the futons and help out the Nursery!
Me too! If I can help out Yomogi Nursery, it makes me really happy.
The Nursery is really important to me too!
Fujimoto!
Let's wait till later when Fujimoto isn't around.
Are you going to classes?
I was concerned because you're always working.
You're all covered in dirt!
Even the most obvious of things
And start crying
If you can't keep it a secret, stop coming here.
What's the matter, Kobato?
Yes. Because I keep getting in his way when he's trying to work.
He'd probably be in trouble without it.
What's up? You're awfully upbeat.
Yes. But what is "university"?
Not that your ignorance surprises me anymore.
Well it is a university after all.
Um...
Yes of course, I have to get this to him!
Sorry. Are you all right?
No!
I was sure he was around here somewhere.
You sure? Are you sure you don't mind?
You're right.
What is it?
All right, all right. I'll help you.
You do understand that I'm just going to help you. You've got to do the work.
Anyway, thanks!
To you, too?
Ms. Sayaka!
Chitose?
Mommy and Chiho and I made some macaroons!
So we brought them for you to try!
Right?
He values your opinion.
Domoto, you're amazing.
I really want to help others out, but I can't do that well. I respect you, Domoto.
Forget it!
Why do you say that?
Domoto...
You were so kind to help me find Fujimoto, but I ran off without even thanking you.
Why do you ask?
You know. You and Fujimoto.
What you said was correct.
You have a lot of wonderful features.
But that's...
I don't know how to say this well, but you are a good person.
Thank you.
30 points!
No way!
Kobato, Teacher Fujimoto isn't mad at you anymore, is he?
He made a bamboo dragonfly for me once.
He's not a bad guy.
Right?!
Everyone dreams of flying
I bet the reason that child looks so terribly sad
Is because he
There's nothing to worry about
See you on Monday!
Is there anything else I can help with?
Oh, you're the one from...
And, umm...
Yup.
Welcome.
Now, put those in a box, Kobato.
An apple pie and a lemon tart. And a cream puff.
Yup. Once you get used to it, I'm sure you'll be great.
It's your birthday?
Here you are. Sorry for the wait!
It must've been switched by accident...
Y-Yes...
I'm sorry!
Here you go, a present for you.
Io...?
He looks like a stuffed animal to everyone right now.
We'll be counting on you tomorrow as well.
I can come in tomorrow too?
Do you think it could be loans?
That's why I hope that I can help them out even just a little bit!
Good morning, Kobato.
He did?
Could you just casually ask him what's the matter then?
But that just makes me even more concerned.
Miss Sayaka seemed very lonely...
What should someone do in that situation?
Thank you very much!
They investigate a lot of things, don't they?
And they do searches and get information and tail people!
You just came to eat my baumkuchen, didn't you!
and the manager's worries are probably work-related.
I even managed to get some chocolate by accident.
Someone's here!
That's probably why he couldn't tell me about it.
Yumi!
You always work so hard,
and I like being able to see you everyday!
That baumkuchen isn't from Tirol, is it?
Iorogi.
Yes, please do!
So cute!
Who's pleased?!
Her wish?
If any of my friends from before saw me like this, they'd cry!
Domoto!
Why did you come to the Nursery?
Guys, it's time for lunch!
Why are you here?
Can't. I'm busy.
Fujimoto, you're always such a big help.
He's only obedient for Miss Sayaka.
I'll try my best to do Fujimoto's work!
Okay!
I have something I need to do.
I know, I know.
That violent and selfish guy who is stuck in the form of a stuffed animal
I'll bet.
There's no way you could hold me down in that form.
That... wish thing, right?
What is it about that girl?
...and always puts others before herself to the point of exhaustion,
I can't listen to this anymore.
If she doesn't fill up this bottle, her wish won't be able to come true...
Ginsei!
Ioryogi!
Ioryogi!
Is that thing really important?
Yes! Ioryogi and I have always been together!
What?
It's a smell that makes you feel nostalgic somehow.
You know what fall smells like even though you don't have memories?
Ioryogi.
It really is fall, isn't it, Ioryogi?
Two!
What's the matter? You shouldn't say things like "I hate you"!
Yuzuru and Toshihiko were having a fight over the blocks...
Are you an idiot?!
He didn't even say he was leaving; it was really unusual.
I wonder what happened.
Hey, were are we going?
Me too!
There's something that needs to be said after a fight, right?
I guess our adult worries were carried over to them.
Yes.
It doesn't mean all that.
Were you also worried about this ginkgo tree?
Well, there's always been talk of that I guess.
Has this humongous tree always been here?
Oh no! Look at the time!
It says it's not lonely.
It says thank you.
I'll... move you somewhere else!
Hey!
But...
I know a wisteria tree who has lived for about as long as this ginkgo tree.
Can you hear the ginkgo tree's song?
It's a little heart-rending, but very gentle.
be1There is limitless kindness in the depth of the world.
be1Guide me, O voice, so far, far away.
In the end, it was able to be carried off on your song, Kobato.
If you heal that soul, then it's not so strange that this would happen.
It must have been really happy at its end, you know?
Out of the ginkgo tree's...?
You carry the potatoes that you dig up.
I believe I said this when we first started.
Of course it was.
We'll help you.
Thank you so much.
It's hot so be careful, okay?
Hey!
Oh! Thank you.
Thanks!
Oh, look who's back.
Yes!
You!
Well, would you look at that.
Are you running away from home?
Running away from home?
Potato Thief is fine.
You have your own name, don't you?
Is that where you're headed to now?
Draw what was around your house too, okay?
Please!
Don't break it...
Keita!
If you're done with your bath, hurry up and go to bed!
Keita is just about to get on the train with his Grandfather right now.
Let's steam some potatoes when we get back.
Are you guys going home now?
I've got something I need to do, so I'll be going ahead.
But Fujimoto was a bully this morning, and...
Just erase the other one first!
If I remember correctly, those papers are from the landlady's...
They'll probably be annoyed, actually.
There's no way to undo what you did!
Miss Sayaka.
Hm?
You didn't get very much sleep, did you?
Chitose said to give this to everyone at the Nursery.
I'm fine, really.
What's the matter with Miss Sayaka?
Thank you very much.
Wow!
Cranes!
I'll fold cranes too!
What about the children?
And with both you and Fujimoto here, I suppose I felt at ease
and thought that it would be okay to just leave things to the two of you...
I'm not a space case!
Are you really that worried about Sayaka?
Hey, Kobato.
Huh?
To tell you the truth... it's an illness!
Yes.
What if our wish isn't able to come true because of my badly folded cranes?
Um...rice porridge?
Rice porridge is supposedly easy to digest.
Seriously, how did you brew up that concoction?
But what?
Exactly.
Staring at them like that won't create more konpeito.
This is...
Cleaning up tomorrow morning is going to be difficult.
Huh?
Let's sell a ton of stuff and pay back the debt collector!
I couldn't care less.
See you tomorrow, goodbye!
Then, I'll be excusing myself first.
What?!
The other guy?
I wonder what she meant when she said that it's impossible for him to just be straightforward.
I wonder who brought them.
Kobato.
Congratulations!
And since I'm the big sister, I'm going to come and pick the baby up from the Nursery!
Yeah!
See you, Kobato.
And even if there are still children there... That's just terrible!
I-I didn't ask him for his name...
He sort of smiled a lot and called Miss Sayaka "Sayaka" without any titles...
Okiura, huh?
Apparently Sayaka's been married before, and she shares the same last name as that guy.
He also just calls her Sayaka...
Huh?
I'll do my best in order to help make the bazaar successful!
I'm sure it'll clear up.
Fujimoto brought them here from his workplace.
Thank you...
Don't tell me he...
They still might come!
Yes, he is.
How much for yakisoba?
Domoto...
Right!
It's great that the weather cleared up, huh?
Well...
Um....
Ioryogi, you're somewhat muddy!
Get a clue!
It's rather bleak out today, huh.
Let's do it, little by little!
You guys have really gotten used to this, huh.
but we somehow managed to catch a good wave.
Huh?
No.
I've completely forgotten what you guys even used to look like in the past.
I guess it does.
It we look at it logically, we really had no chance of winning.
W-What?
That's important merchandise!
That's weird...
Body's so heavy...
What is that mysterious thing?
Hey, wait a second!
I did it!
Even if you face difficulties, you can't give up.
Thank you!
Yup.
Really?
Today's score is...
I said I don't need that thing!!
That's so mean, Ioryogi!
I'll do it once more!
That's right. There isn't much time left until spring! Do you understand?
Right...
If you don't hurry up, you'll end up not being able to go anywhere!
Come on.
There's so much!
Yeah.
If this continues, Yomogi Nursery will end up shutting down.
an8No, no, we'll mix it together so it'll be green and white.
On days like this, futons are fluffy, and it's just wonderful.
And the bazaar from just a while ago - so many people came to it!
Try saying that after you've paid back your debt.
Goodbye!
Shut up... go away!
What's the matter?!
The surgery and everything went well.
No, it's not.
But the cleaning
Kobato.
Domoto.
All right.
Bye.
Yes.
Santa will come, won't he?
What are you doing, Yuzuru?
More importantly, you know what else you need to be worrying about, right?
No, I'm fine!
Um... Thanks to the bazaar, I've already gotten new toys...
Doesn't matter whether it's Christmas or not.
Huh?
I have work tonight...
Have a safe trip.
Kiyokazu... became an orphan on Christmas Eve.
Now, let's start the Christmas party!
All right then, let's all call for Santa Claus!
Santa, are you Mr. Kiyokazu?
Can we have presents?
All right everyone, let's have some cake now, shall we?
Oh, Fujimoto, good job today!
Kobato!
I made him hate me all over again.
It's a Christmas present.
Go.
She's waiting for you.
Merry Christmas.
He said, "I'm going to get the perfect present for you, so just wait here!"
He gave me the chance to make up with you...
Anyway... just don't worry about it.
But I'm...
Well, it's supposedly the opposite nowadays.
We landed funny again, didn't we?
You! Don't think you can get away!
You... don't have any money?
No, I sleep with Ioryogi.
Let's go!
I'm going to be late!
We tried to wake you up many times.
You're good at cooking, and Mr. Kuro working in a pastry shop is a bit...
Mokona's good at pretending to be a stuffed animal!
Once you get used to it, it's easy enough.
I...
We sure worked a lot, didn't we?
People asked us if we were cosplaying!
Are you sure? Is this okay?
We were only here for two days, but it was a lot of fun!
Kobato, that's a funny looking shape!
Don't go sticking your nose into something you can't handle.
Dou sureba iin dakke?
Atarimae no kototte itsumo
No way. The cat's owner can no longer care for her.
He's absolutely right.
It's Kobato.
U-Um, I don't think this would work as a meal.
I was hoping you had something I could feed her.
Sure.
Is that right. But at this rate, the kitten's going to end up all alone.
U-Um...
Everyone seems happy.
Yuzuru. You might be allergic to cats.
If it worsens, it can lead to asthma.
Huh?
Milk. We'll be sure to find someone to take care of you.
I'm sorry.
I don't think that at all. You're trying so hard.
So we all want to be of help.
That's just him. Don't worry about it.
There must have been a reason.
Milk's getting tired, too.
Yes.
But what are you doing here?
Oh my.
Yes. My grandchild is an only child and I'm sure she'd be thrilled to have a little playmate.
Yes. He was asking at every house he delivered pizzas to, if they could care for a kitten.
Milk's milk dish.
Oh, that...
I forgot to return it to you.
...milk dish.
Come to think of it, there was a full moon like tonight the night I first met that grandmother.
But then she cried even louder!
Huh?
My heart shimmers with the light
Voices of singing
Hello?
Huh? Kobato? What's up?
Yes. It was all my fault. I caused everybody a lot of worry and trouble.
What?!
Come to think of it, Milk's dish is round, too.
Miss Sayaka and Ioryogi and Toshihiko and...
I don't think of you as any more than a stranger.
If it's not just a building, then what are you trying so hard to protect?
But at this rate
Hey.
The root of Yomogi Nursery's debt problem is also because
If he knew this and still went along with his father, he's just as guilty!
I'm so sorry that things turned out like this.
Chise!
He looked really lonely somehow.
Hey.
Excuse me!
And if not tomorrow, then the day after.
Like I just said, I'm going to
You're a difficult one, aren't you?
Chitose said that you still love Miss Sayaka and that Miss Sayaka still loves you.
I just can't imagine that you're a good person after all of that.
Miss Sayaka, if you still care for Mr. Okiura... then please go after him and show him!
Was it a dream about the place you want to go to?
Okay!
I'm sorry...
What?
Fujimoto?
I thought you were going to be late today?
Yeah. I'll be back by tonight though.
What? No sense of courtesy, that one.
My bad.
Don't worry about it! He'll be just fine.
That's impossible.
Yeah. Take Ushagi as a hostage, and use her as leverage against him.
Who's the one who's going to get hurt?
I got it! I won't do anything.
Yes.
I think Yomogi Nursery might've actually been holding him down.
Thanks so much, Fujimoto!
Yes. That's why it was too much.
That's why you'll have to take care of him, okay, Kobato?
Domoto.
But don't push yourself too hard though, okay?
That's right. They went out together.
Wow, look at the boats!
Switch.
You are so happy-go-lucky.
Let's hurry back!
Oh, look here!
Can that be said for those of the spirit world as well?
I don't really feel grateful for this or anything.
As long as you're happy, Fujimoto, I'm happy too.
You don't care what happens to you?
I may be, I guess.
A full, 100 point idiot.
Shall we go then?
Jeez, he's still not back yet.
Where did she say she was going?
She only said that she'd call after she got settled in...
I'm...
What are you doing?!
I don't know.
Because of her contract.
Okay.
H-Hey, what's going on?
But...
Don't go!
Goodbye.
The konpeito... are accumulating.
But the contract cannot be changed.
Fujimoto carried it for us.
Yeah. It's already been a month after all.
Hey Fujimoto...
Let's all?
I want to go too!
I'm sorry!
Yes?
It's been just about four years since he came to work at my firm.
Hello, this is Fukita Law Firm.
Even if we've lost all memory of our previous lives.
Up until now...
I hope you'll be able to find her.
And that's it.
because he said he wanted to watch over that girl from the shadows and decided to stay in the human world,
Yes, I do!
You understand this, too?
Fun?! Ill show you something fun!
What do you need to do to accomplish this?
What do you need to do to get the bottle?
Under my great observation and judgment, the tests have already started.
In this park, you need to show proper springtime behavior.
Sleeping through spring is bug behavior!
I wont be on time for the bus.
She dropped it.
Okay.
Garbage collection Garbage collection site
Tea?
Well, shall we go?
Hey! Dont play games with me!
Yeah, youre right.
Its probably a flower-viewing festival.
Lets go check it out.
Its so pretty.
Okay.
Its delicious.
Miss, well add this to our menu.
Dobatos is getting too conceited.
Shes working her hardest for him.
Huh?
Im going to sing my best, okay?
Its okay. I just made it back to my part-time job.
Thats great.
Well, they asked you to sing, so its okay to get gifts in return.
You only did insane things at the first half.
But your song was okay.
Youre horrible!
Thank you so much for earlier this evening.
Y-Yes, good night.
Hanato Kobato!
Its the bottle, isnt it?
I need to collect broken hearts and put them in the bottle.
Dont do pointless things. Do you understand, Dobato?
Yes! Im collecting peoples broken hearts, Ioryogi-san.
Just hurry up and go!
We need someone to be it for kick the can.
Okay! Ill do my best!
Quite the little optimist, arent you?
Its true!
Im sorry. I work here at Yomogi Preschool.
Since youd need a hand, can I help out?
Whats his name?
Probably not
I just wanted to thank you.
Kiyokazu-sensei! Hurry and play the organ!
Kobato-chans so funny!
All we know is your name. Thats all you ever say.
Its a bother having people think youre pitiable or have it hard.
Leaving someone behind in the middle of the city.
Just as I thought
I guess the things that Im doing arent healing anyone.
Excuse me?
Toshihiko-kun?
Huh?
Oh youre so clever and unselfish.
If you dont swing harder
Even though you got 100 points, dont get too ahead of yourself.
Its raining.
Yeah, it is.
Dobato!
Sayaka-sensei.
Okay!
See you later, Kobato-chan. I have to go back to the preschool.
She seems so nice!
Yes!
Im sorry. Are you all right?
Im sorry. It got all wet.
Im cleaning right now.
If you dont have an umbrella, hell get wet too.
Tadokoro?
Be quiet! Katsuragi, you idiot!
Wait!
Yes!
Ioryogi-san?
Thats because you didnt cover it.
I-Im sorry
Its because of the futon jutting out, huh?
Yeah! Bye-bye.
Kobato-chan, do you have an umbrella?
My umbrellas back.
Nice to meet you too. Im Hanato Kobato.
They gave me a futon.
I think its best to leave her alone for now.
Then, why?
Matsumi-san still doesnt look very happy.
I just wanted to cheer Matsumi-san up, so I helped her out.
The extra confetti in there is the very proof of it.
Whats wrong, Kohaku?
Thats mean, Ioryogi-san. You said you would give me high points just now!
I feel so content!
Do you think I want to be around you for a hundred years?!
Yes! Heal peoples broken hearts, so I can get more confetti.
Why are you crying?
Ioryogi-san, Ive heard that name somewhere.
I knew this would happen.
Dont be rude.
Theyre flirting like crazy!
When will it be okay for me to call out to them?
And the patients are very important.
Fill the sky, oh blessed rain!
No, Im sorry too. I apologise for coming here uninvited.
Why are you here?
I dont understand it well myself.
But when I see something pretty, I want to show it to Shuichiro-san as well.
It reminds me of him.
An ache?
You could say it feels fuzzy. Might wanna see a doctor -Z
For crying out loud, you shed tears because youre so in love it hurts!
Winning something like this is just a bother.
If its not the amusement park tickets, then its no good.
A time limit?
Theyre not shaking.
I wonder if its because I havent healed Kohaku-sans heart.
So she wasnt hurt!
Minus hundred points?
Read this!
Read it.
Tonight, it seems like the moon is taking a break.
Huh?
Can I help you with something?
Futons really are the best.
Im Hanato Kobato and this is Ioryogi-san.
Just how flaky can you be? Keeper: orig line "How dull are you going to get?"
Good morning.
Come on! Eat it!
Fujimoto-san!
But arent you the one whos not returning our money, sensei?
P-Please go home.
Please go home!
Mr. Police Officer!
Toshihiko-kun?
Dobato, you did good today.
Whys that?
What is it? He thought as he approached it.
She said a firefly story would be good, so I went ahead and wrote it.
I dont have the time.
At that time, I was very busy.
Fireflies.
Why didnt I go with her back then?
Here.
Hes writing again.
But at the library you treated me poorly.
Oh, thank you so much!
79 points.
Fujimoto-kun and Kobato-chan, you two didnt forget anything either, right?
Everyones going on a field trip.
Hello! Hanato Kobato!
Because you didnt do it, so I thought you might get upset.
What?
Im passing on the field trip.
Geez, youre late.
I was just wondering if the debt collector is an acquaintance of Sayaka-sensei.
Just now, a man called.
Did you have to insert yourself in the shops name?
Dont say that character.
I dont want to hear that from a stuffed animal like you.
Nothing at all! Thats the truth!
Yes!
Okay! Im going to do my best!
And its also quite pathetic.
Fujimoto-san?
Yuzuru-kun, Yukari-chan, I found you!
Masao-kun too!
Kobato-chan, you have a leaf stuck in your hair again.
Lastly, lets take a keepsake picture together.
Marina-chan!
Marina-chan!
Find her?
Its okay that you didnt find it.
There it is.
Therere lots and lots. It looks like we found happiness.
And it was from Genko-sama too!
At this rate, sooner or later Yomogi Preschool will be crushed.
What did I tell you? Kompeito collecting isn't going to be easy.
Flutes and drums, street vendors and yukata.
Is all
And let the light gather around me
I surprise myself
Yes, that's it!
Have you ever been to one?
Maybe I won't be going this year.
Okay! I'm not going to lose to you!
Oh yeah? But you know what, I can swim a little now.
You were walking with your eye on your cell phone again, weren't you?
Are you all right?
No, I am not okay!
And you. You're losing to summer festivals already.
That's right!
Summer is an easy time to lose control.
Well then, I'm now confirming the emergency contact network for summer vacation.
Have more confidence in yourself.
This girl came looking for you.
Sorry we're late.
We'll help clean the pool so let her go, okay?
I didn't know.
I-I'd like to join you!
But telling her you'd like to join her. Is there a more direct pickup line?
Um. Sorry for abruptly using a line to pick you up!
It looks like Yukino.
I'd like to help Natsuki.
I can finally buy the camera I want when they begin that sale at the station building tomorrow.
Yeah.
I'll look after mine, too!
She is my idol.
That's right.
To celebrate your SLR camera debut!
Natsuki!
It's nowhere...
I've kept mine all this time, too.
Ms. Sayaka and Ms. Chitose, have you ever quarreled?
Natsuki, smile!
Wow!
Itd probably be better to buy new ones.
Nothing special.
Of course.
A Kind Person
What did you want to ask me?
If you tell her, she will suffer. Thats why.
Sayaka-sensei will suffer?
Stop! The paint is still wet, so dont touch.
Im sure he only got angry because hes worried about you.
Yes, of course. If I apologize, I think hell let me help again.
Could you take it to him for me?
Just look for him.
We couldnt find Fujimoto-san.
Yeah, probably.
Oh, Im Doumoto Takashi. And you are?
He gets mad really easily.
We want your help.
We dont know where to start on Professor Hayakawas report.
And suddenly we only have until next week. Isnt that terrible?
I get it, I get it. Okay.
Good afternoon!
Itll be bad if I cant get the credits this year.
Really? I owe you one.
Its all right.
Okay everyone, lets go hide!
So, you shouldnt apologize.
Youre skipping class, arent you? I dont want to help people like that.
What is it?
No, you werent wrong.
Yeah.
Doumoto-san!
Is it wrong to simply help people?
Youre a curious girl.
Because I dont know anything, Im always making Ioryogi-san angry.
Ioryogi-san?
That stuffed animal is Ioryogi-san?
But, I got confetti just for appreciating him?
If its what the other person is looking for.
Well, stud muffins also have their own problems.
Nobody would believe in a talking stuffed animal or talking to a stuffed animal!
Dont you dare get another one of your ideas!
Chiho-chan whats the answer to number five?
Coming!
Ah!
Huh?
Its for this kitten.
Really? Then, if this keeps up, the kitten will be all alone again.
It would be a good idea to find a new owner
Kobato-san? What would be good?
Me too!
Kobato-chan, Im really sorry.
Youre just as bad as the person who abandoned it.
Sayaka-sensei!
Its okay.
Have you been good?
Thank you very much. I seem to cause trouble for everyone I meet.
Is that so?
Oh my.
The girl with that wonderful song.
Is that so?
Well come visit!
Milks milkbowl.
I forgot to give it back.
The cherry blossoms were blooming ever so beautifully.
Eh?
And its all thanks to you, Fujimoto-san.
Oh yeah, and Milks milkbowl is also a circle! They all go together!
Summertime Memories
The summer vacation is our rival, okay?
Beaches!
Hey, you listening, Dobato?!
I will heal everyone whose hearts are hurting!
Its a notice for a summer festival!
But
Hey, lets have a race at the pool!
Oh
Youre giving that back, right?
Ah, hey!
Nacchan, Im really sorry!
Pick-up line? People dont do that?
That looks like Yukino-san.
It was taken during a summer festival while we were in grade school.
Yeah, sure.
Yes.
Is that so?
I want my own so much that Ive been working for a while now.
Now Im completely hooked.
I think Natsuki-san and Yukino-san
Out shopping?
Please?
How?
Natsuki-san.
Thank you!
Same
Nacchan
Yukino I was very mean to you earlier
Um
Ive also always been keeping it.
The fireworks are beautiful!
What the hell are you doing getting cheered up by the summer festival!
Thats it! Im giving you minus 200 points, Dobato!
Hes mean.
Fujimoto-san was just next door in his room, and now hes leaving.
Hm?
Sayaka-sensei?!
Futons?
What kind of person is he?
Care to see?
Sorry to keep you waiting. I found it.
So Fujimoto-san was a student at Yomogi Preschool?
It is a child that doesnt have a mother, a father, or any family.
So thats why
I want to know even more about Fujimoto-san when he was little!
Understood.
Yomogi Preschool has a gi!
I tried introducing him to the kids.
They were all very interested in him at first.
and that there was no way to help him.
Come on!
Would you like a nice beer?
Will they start blooming soon?
Really?
Dude, why did you push me?
All right, geez.
Now theyre just waiting for them to bloom!
Go and chase, go and chase. Go and chase the snow white clouds.
High upon the mountaintop you can see everything.
The sun?
When you air out futons, theyll smell like the sun.
Welcome back!
Then dont mind if I do!
Someone special?
how I feel.
Welcome back, Kobato-san.
You were so cute when you were little!
Huh?
Sayaka-sensei showed me some pictures today!
Bye-bye, Kobato-chan!
Im sorry!
Um, is there anything you need help with?
There are this many jobs available? Great Recession over?
Youll get lost for sure!
Youd screw that up by breaking vases and stuff.
Then what kind of work can I do?
Youre welcome.
Yes!
Well first you say welcome to any customers that come in.
Welcome!
Mm-hmm! Youll be fine once you get the hang of it.
Here.
Welcome!
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Do you mean it? I can come back tomorrow?
Ill take care of that.
Oh, Sayaka-sensei and Fujimoto-san are much more admirable than I am.
Not being able to help someone even though you want to must be hard.
Kobato, what job are you planning on next?
Let me handle it!
Welcome!
Im going to go visit Chitose.
Although I dont think youre up to the job, Dobato.
Ah, its Kobato-san!
Just like a detective!
Motives, alibis, evidence
Do you have any ideas?
You think Ill take you up on that?
Youre sure stingy, Genko.
Im a detective!
Our boss is so nice to everyone.
I enjoy working with you. You dont have to give me time off.
Well
Okay!
Yes! Detective Kobato has closed another case!
And I get to eat another Baumkuchen.
I have something for you!
Im also working very hard!
Dont work yourself to death.
Do you mean Ioryogi-san?
Come on! Gimme a break here!
Fine then.
So how did it all begin?
The only ones not aware of those separate worlds are the humans living in their world.
We were all willing participants, but the ringleader got the brunt of the punishment.
Come tag me, Im right here!
Everyone, time for lunch! Wash your hands and go inside!
Its okay. I have an idea.
Yes!
Ill see you tomorrow!
Kobato.
Oh, is that right?
No matter the circumstances, thats how itll be with them.
No! Its Ioryogi!
Ginsei!
Minus 200 points!
Im sorry.
and it makes your chest feel a little refreshed, or a little tight
You dont have your memories, but you remember the smell of autumn?
Whats wrong?
Look at this. Do you know what this means?
Um
Two.
Good morning!
I dont want to anymore!
Huh? Ioryogi-san?
Um
Toys
This is for you, Sayaka-sensei. Wow this kids voice
Well, well be doing some redevelopment here too.
Redevelopment is so harsh on old things!
It said that the most happy thing for it,
Its a little sad, but its so gentle.
That was dangerous!
Thats good. Now youve all made up.
Whats with that outfit?
Were digging up potatoes at the nursery today!
Everyone was dressed like this while working in the fields.
Theyre so big!
Ow
Amazing!
Kobato-chan, your butts covered in dirt.
Whos that?
Thats a lot of potatoes.
Well help.
signYomogi Preschool
Is it hot?
What should we do with all of these?
Were from Yomogi Preschool.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hello!
No!
Draw whats around your house too.
Id like to help Keita-kun find his home.
Which way? Right, left?
Keita-kun, isnt that great?
Yeah!
Fujimoto does have some good sides.
fad0,830Yummy!
Could that dog be?
Whos Sayaka-sensei?
Kind?
Its hard to tell when someones bullying you or not.
Besides that, Im hungry.
Um
I see.
Then let's bring it back to 50 points!
so she asked me to make decorations for the kids at Yomogi Preschool!
Ioryogi-san
Fujimoto-san!!
Ill get better
Please!
Shes suffering from complications due to sleep-deprivation along with a mild gastritis.
Ill give her some medicine later.
Hes living with Kohaku-san
Really?
Me too!
Really? Oh, right But
Yes.
Sayaka-sensei.
After you came, Ive been wondering in the back of my mind,
If something were to happen to you
Ill take care of things here, so go home.
I hope so
Hot hot
I was trying to make porridge.
redHot Hot
Thats why I wanted to make some for Sayaka-sensei.
put it on the stove and wait for it to boil.
Like who?
I wonder why.
The leaves are falling again
Im home!
Sayaka-sensei, lets hold a bazaar!
If we could pay off the debts with just that, we wouldve paid it off ages ago.
wed end up feeling sorry for her.
but saying it like that wont do.
Lets do the bazaar!
You bring in things you dont need at home, or things that youve made,
What is that?
Kobato-chan, thanks for your work today.
If we sell a lot of teru teru bozu, will we get to keep the preschool?
Mom is on vacation starting this month,
Everyone, lets do our best!
It really got late, didnt it?
Judging by your voice, are you the one who picked up the phone earlier?
Youre a bad person, so I cant tell you!
You cant!
I wont forgive you if you make Sayaka-san cry any more.
His names Okiura, right?
Is that a penguin?
II wont fall over!
You will.
You two sure get along.
Thank you
Would you like some yakisoba?
But
All of us, together!
Is this the bazaar?
Oh, is this it?
Okay!
Muzukashii na
You've got a lot of energy first thing in the morning in this darn hot weather!
Huh?
No I'm not!
Like I keep telling you, in this world I am a stuffed doll!
See you later.
Take care, now. Have a nice day.
He sure is a busy man.
The former principal was apparently tricked into borrowing money!
Looks like a real bad bunch who tricked him.
Well sometimes he's mean and then sometimes he isn't. I don't know.
I don't understand him.
That's hard to imagine.
Oh um... An orphan is a child who doesn't have a mother or a father or a home.
Huh?
All right.
That was about fourteen years ago.
I'm home, Sayaka.
Fujimoto looks angry.
He was the type that just wouldn't let anyone close to him, so perhaps it couldn't be helped.
Hello.
Sayaka!
See you tomorrow!
Well then everybody. Tidy up before you play.
But it didn't hit her, did it?
We've been looking forward to seeing them blossom, very soon!
The sunflower...
Yes. He's helping in every way he can to pay back kindergarten loans.
Soft, and a nice scent!
Well, that's what my father told me anyway.
It's time to go, yes, there is your home
I'm sorry.
I-Is this allowed?!
Those who are dear.
I feel...
Huh?
Why do I get the feeling we're heading in the wrong direction again?
Welcome home.
Me too!

Its getting really dark and cloudy.
Ill bring something thatll really sell.
Yeah right.
There was a time when I was doing a lot of part-time work too.
Thats true.
For now, we have to keep making baumkuchen
Hey, stop it!
If you dont stop this now, Ill burn you to a crisp
Hey, wait!
Im a stuffed animal, but Im not
You just suck.
Be a nice man and give up instead of getting upset!
Despite my appearances, long ago people used to call me
Kobato-chan.
Today was a wonderful day!
Really?
Your score for today was 80 points for your passion towards the bazaar.
Then Ill apologize!
opening
Warmth of the Cold Wintry Wind.
Get it?
Yes
All Im doing is standing here.
Ill mail you the forms, then.
That's the third child this month
to leave the preschool.
Dont push yourself too much.
Ill be fine.
Sayaka-sensei looked very forlorn.
Dont.
So Im going to go talk to him!
Kobato-chan!
Snow!
And then
On a day like this, it feels really nice to curl up on a fluffy mattress!
This preschool is full full of everyones memories!
Besides, his father wouldnt have any pity.
His father?
It was.
Go to sleep.
Yes? This is Yomogi Preschool.
Appendicitis?
I see.
Hes in the central hospital.
Um that mans all right.
Ioryogi-san, thanks for waiting.
You didnt get any confetti today.
But
Want to sit somewhere for a bit?
Kobato-chan
Thanks to you, I feel a little better.
Achoo!
Kobato-chan.
Yes, what is it?
Would you
Yeah.
Thats right.
Doumoto-san!
For me?
Ill be fine.
Ill see you tomorrow, then.
Here! Keeper: lol. Expression: priceless
And Christmas is
Good luck at work.
Its not that.
Its Santa-san!
Lets eat the cake now.
Fujimoto-san, good work.
Fujimoto-san must hate me again.
I see
She keeps wanting to apologize to you.
Its not your fault.
What did Doumoto tell you?!
insert
there were a lot of magazines with chocolate on the covers.
Valentines Day?
You dont hold them in preschools?
Yes!
Why not try a Valentines party?
If we go in the morning and ask them,
Fight! Hiya! Hiya!
Thank you.
Its a world with humans!
We dont know if white meatbunmanju-looking things speak here!
W-What is it?
Kobato, you!
So thats Ioryogi-san!
9:14 eyecatch
It does.
But, but, if you all gather around to sleep
Um
Oh, I mixed up the two of you!
but I still needed to be at Chirorus in the morning!
Kobato-chan, youre going to a cake bakery, right?
Yes.
Youre good with food.
Ill be with Ioryogi-san!
Amazing!
Slowly
I did it!
I dont know when Ill return, but shes back there waiting for me.
Or is it because you want to meet someone there?
Someone I want to meet?
All you did was sit!
Yeah, well be happy if you take it.
Its our thanks for letting us stay.
Thanks for letting us stay.
Oh, no, sorry I couldnt be of more help.
There might be a lot of others, too.

Thank you!
Kobato-chan, who are you going to give your best to?
Kobato
Next Episode
What the heck is this?
Well, well?
Kobato-chan.
Its okay.
Why did you change so much?
Its what she inherited from the principal, who passed away!
Youre threatening her.
The principal got caught up in those money deals and died from the stress.
in order to protect the preschool from the president.
Kobato, was it?
Im really happy that you thought of me. Keeper: orig line "Im really happy for all of your consideration."
And Sayaka still has feelings for him.
There are times when they have to go different ways.
That man!
Send her away.
Every one of them Why are they so taken in by that preschool?
Ive got nothing to speak with you about.
Well take down the preschool,
Things cant stay like this!
I couldnt hold back my fathers power.
Kobato. 22 TL
We apologize for the inconvenience, but this preschool has been closed. We humbly apologize. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the principal, Okiura Sayaka.
Throw them out, eh
But I just want you to know this.
But Sayaka-sensei said it was for the best.
Fujimoto, eh?
Whats with that reaction?
Kiyokazu-kun?
You could at least take a break today
The neighbors left, so Ill be off too.
Fujimoto-san is busy!
Bye bye.
I thought it was a pretty vast place, but now that I see it like this
I was relying on Fujimoto-kun.
Take care of Fujimoto-kun. You should sleep with Fujimoto-kun.
Worrying about him wouldfscx200-
Dont push yourself so much!
Ushagi-san!
Oh!
Whats the big idea?
So I want Fujimoto-san to have some fun!
roofBoat Rentals
Were moving!
Do you know what youre dealing with right now?!
Hey, Kohaku!
Go give this fellow easy-goer a lecture!
Is that only for the Celestial World?
Its only natural to be concerned for someone you think is important.
How are you handling your laundry?
Im sure theyll miss you.
I see.
Oh well, I guess its okay like this.
Painful?
Why do you say that?
Wait!
and shes only good for being bright and honest,
Ioryogi-san. Youre troubling Ushagi-san.
Sorry, Kobato.
I dont know.
Are you joking with me?
What do you think youre pulling by leaving without saying a word?
Is that the stuffed animal?
This wont do
Dont go!
Please!
The same goes for me.
But if everything that occurs is inevitable
Whats going on?
Its been a full month, after all.
I see. Thanks.
I see.
That poor preschool.
Thank you.
Fujimoto-kun, Im thinking of re-establishing Yomogi Preschool.
Thats right.
How come no one remembers her?
Is that all right?
Kobato-sans wish was
To cross over time and be reborn so that she could be with the one she loves.
He has the same soul, so
Hes still young, but he really has it together.
Okay.
Ill go investigate the location tomorrow.
I see.
Thats it.
You made me wait so many years.
Youre way late.
You understand that too, right?
For one whole day, you have to fit into the human world and display human common sense.
For crying out loud, you can't even act like a human being at a park.
Hurry up and throw it away or they'll pick you clean.
Wanna get a drink?
Really? Thank you very much!
There'll be a lot of people coming to see the flowers, so we're going to be busy.
It was a really cute cat!
Sorry, Boss! There's an emergency...
Hey, could you pass that here?
What's going on?!
Man, my part timer had to run earlier.
Really?
Coming!
I'm adding stuff... to the hotpot?!
No chocolate!
Wanna try it?
It's really good.
No way...
But...
and the endless sky of Summer
are both brilliantly engraved into my heart...
It seems like he stopped crying.
But your singing was okay.
You just said my singing was okay!
That's mean! You're horrible!
But I tried my best!
Kobato Hanato!
We hope you'll visit.
Today we're running the integration test on that program, huh?
An imaginary creation that breathes fire, flies, and sometimes uses magic.
Would it be all right to come in?
It's not a dream?
The mountains!
Mountains...
Because you said a maid would be best!
I can't change the impossible.
It's not a dream?
So you can hear me.
I'm good at cleaning!
You do laundry!
You entertain guests.
I'm the best at that!
Hmm, you don't even know the basics of being a maid.
Many of my friends were actually slain using the things they like.
I'm a woman, though?
I'd like you to use me to commute to work again tomorrow!
It'll be a relief to know you're here keeping the house safe.
Well, I'm off to the office.
Oh, right.
Understood!
I guess I'll ask Fafnir-san.
That's helpful!
Wait, are you old enough to drink?
That's why correcting that is part of our job.
Ah.
Maids don't talk like that!
Are you underestimating maids?
We're giving you some high-level maid conversations, so talk. Got it?
Hurry up and finish!
You can't. You need to change, too.
Have a safe trip.
Kill th
Let's not.
Hello, Lucoa-san?
That breath...
Yes, good night.
Good night.
What else?
When I talked about that, our maid said she'd love to meet her.
Do I look that old?
Young Lady, I believe introductions are due.
Right foot, red.
Ah, K-Kanna-san's so...
soft!
Impressive.
At first it was a picture book.
Do you think I'm getting along with the kids in our class?
but I want something like what Kobayashi and Tohru share.
I can't take it!
Huh?
I guess she goes by the nickname Georgie when disguising herself as a maid.
Understood!
Hmm? A child?
You let yourself be summoned by a ritual some kid did because they were curious?
Hmm?
when he's with an older woman whose body is an agitator of lust...
but none of it has worked.
Are you planning to gather your allies and take over our home?!
You won't fool me, demon!
You see? It's like this every time.
But you can't just stay here doing nothing, right?
I don't think there's much point if you don't work hard to earn that for yourself.
Huh? Huh?!
Come on, I'm not a demon. Look closer!
Go away, demon!
Let's hang this.
A teruterubouzu?
Nyami-nyami.
Rules.
You're doing great!
And I can obtain a limited edition item at that event, right?
Being able to live with Mr. Fafnir.
And spending that much time on every person is bothersome.
the misses that trespass on my home to steal my treasure are better.
However...
it's tempting to just mow them all down at once, isn't it, Miss Kobayashi?
Don't do it.
That doesn't make me happy to hear at all.
Oh, that works for your swimsuits, too?
I want to play now.
Then why did you come with us today?
Because I don't have much else to do this summer.
W-Well what?
Does she have gills or something?
Thanks for the meal!
What's next?
Oh, I haven't seen them in a while.
It's just, well...
Tohru, aren't you homesick?
Really?
It is.
Yeah.
A real dragon is way better than that!
What on Earth is this?!
The admission line for Comiket.
By the way, was leaving Kanna behind a good idea?
Man, thanks, you two!
Please don't run.
Something powerful is holding back their selfish impulses!
The end of the line for Water Dragon Shrine starts here!
I told you, I'm real!
Comiket is not to be underestimated.
Time to switch.
I've been waiting for this!
Say nothing.
Huh?!
The one that could eat us all?!
Huh?!
Your outfit's out!
Did you not read the participant guide?!
Those with great presence have left records of their stays in this world on different levels,
Over here, too, please!
But I can hang in there.
Um, it seems like everyone here is being drawn to this place by something powerful.
It's fine.
What will we print for our next thin book?
My summer homework.
mysterious or would like to know more about.
I see. Got it.
Kobayashi-san, there's a lot of talk about Tohru-chan on the internet.
And they got turned on by those eyes.
Yes. I'm the best!
The ingredients are your choice.
Kobayashi's into it.
But bacon and eggs are delicious, right?
What's so bad?
I'm sorry.
What's this? Where do they sell it?
Jeez, you flatterer.
Our room...
Like cats and dogs.
Good girl.
three islands disappeared.
So you're one of the villains.
I'm
Haven't you eaten anything since yesterday?
Sorry for the intrusion!
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Wh-What's going on? Why are you here?
This is where I work.
Hmm?
What is this box?
I'm home!
For tonight's dinner...
be it a full course meal or an imperial feast!
Oh, shall I slaughter a cow?
They look good.
Show me your butt!
You want me to satisfy your lust, not just your appetite?!
What do you mean?
What are you here for?
Miss Kobayashi.
I work hard too,
I've had friends, but never close friends.
Well, um...
For now, please put down the cream bread you're holding.
Running?
You can eat lunch with them, as well.
Kanna, Miss Kobayashi's in the middle of her death march
Don't be selfish.
No.
Miss Kobayashi, hang in there!
Make do?
Forget it!
I'm not that great though.
So I think that's why she wants you to spoil her.
Hmm...
Victorious...
Shut up! You got a problem with that?!
It's my first time seeing you worry about something like this.
I'm home.
Oh, welcome home.
I'm home.
It's all right if you don't come to the sports festival.
So, good luck with your work, Kobayashi.
Really?
Yeah, I did.
I could go for both!
No, that would go over my daily limit! I can't!
Do your best!
Done.
It's all right, Saikawa. Let's do our best next time.
Seventh on our program is the fifth graders' treasure hunt.
Eat plenty, and give it your best today.
How am I supposed to choose just one from over ten different combinations?
Kanna-chan!
Saikawa, do your best!
They've passed Class 1!
Class 2 wins!
Thanks, Saikawa.
You're welcome.
My life's really changed.
When did I change this much?
Mhmm.
Humans are frightening!
Could you put on a show in my stead, Tohru-chan?
Yeah!
Umm, where's Kanna-san's mom?
Hmph.
What are we doing for this show?
How about an eating contest?
I'm sorry, could you speak Japanese?
Stone stage?
Oh. So she strangled her own granddaughter.
Saikawa, you know so much. I'm amazed.
Well, leave that to me.
Wha...
That's incredible, Kanna-chan.
Matches.
Chimney?
What's this?
Well...
She can obtain the power to burn this corrupt world to ash.
Now there's nothing from the original left.
Narrator, stop grinning.
Did we make it in time?
Looks like it.
It was an awfully cold night.
Please make me a magical girl, too!
and get money to feed my sick wife!
You would voice your desires without shame?
Still, it's unfortunate.
A magical girl's role is to cleanse corruption from this world.
Let's go look there.
Huh? Where's everyone else?
She escorted Ms. Saikawa home.
You asking to see the view at night.
Huh?
What is it?
What's that?
It's a lottery.
Tohru-sama, is that magic?
Hot springs would be nice.
I know!
a6Aah.
I'm home.
Is it-
No, these are my natural duties as a maid.
Yes, yes. Hello?
If you put it in your freezer you can keep it from molding.
Good job.
Going by the pattern thus far, as soon as I climb under again...
Well, we received this from Sone-san.
Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar.
I can't accept it at all!
For getting along with the neighbors, and everything else you've done...
Eh?
Indeed, it does.
Mhmm.
This is my first time seeing it.
I wonder what's going on.
Tohru.
Kobayashi, can I invite Saikawa over?
Tohru and Kanna made the mochi.
It's good!
I'll make some sweet red bean soup later, too.
It still won't happen next year or the year after.
I want to watch anime.
Well, I understand how you feel.
It's closer to you, isn't it?
Aah, all right fine.
Are you sure?
Okay!
What do I do!?
Occasionally we chat on the phone.
I think I understand.
Cleaning, cleaning.
Rooster, check!
Thank you.
Fluffy, juicy eggs, hot rice with ketchup, all at restaurant quality!
Ah!
I want it to be a little more special.
What's with that outfit?
I was in the middle of making trial batches of omurice for Kobayashi-san to eat.
Could you please!?
Only for a moment.
The one serving as Valhalla's alarm clock?
a6TL Note: A warrior of Norse lore who has died and gone to Valhalla.
I was planning to cook the rice with it. Just...
I've fought with the elves before, so I took it in secret.
Now, then.
Thinking about it now...
Forget about that, hurry up and fix this error!
a6Help me out here!
Kobayashi! We've got errors!
That's my stop!
It's pitch black!
Whoa! It's a dragon! Hug me!
Ow!
Why, you!
I imagine you managed to remove that sword because you lack faith.
a6Eh? Uh...
Sure.
Do you have anywhere to go?
So, Tohru.
I feel like I dreamt about something important...
Kobayashi!
I'm confident in it!
i1Is it okay if I pet him?
Eh? What were they like?
A bandit?
Oh, sorry!
Dragon-san, you're not used to threatening people, are you?
Let me stay for a while.
Hey, hey, what's it feel like being a dragon?
a6At the time I found myself thinking.
But it'd be my choice.
I see.
I think I should be good now.
You're leaving?
Don't mess with me! I'll never let a human ride me!
And so I parted ways with that annoying human.
Oh, well.
I hope so, too.
I wonder what she's like when she's shopping.
Huh?
Why are you friends with the fishmonger?
Huh? We're not friends.
Huh? You mean it?
Or rather...
My, long time no see.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Purse snatcher! Someone stop him!
Huh?
Doesn't this mean trouble?
Hey, aren't you making a mistake? I'm not a slu
Are you cheating on me?!
Ah...
Actually...
It would be futile for me to try sending her back.
I'm so glad I fell in love with Miss Kobayashi.
Well then, would you like to play with me outside today?
Would you like to come, too, Miss Kobayashi?
Well, whatever.
I don't need grilled tail.
Lady Tohru, you're smart!
Does Kobayashi possess a license?
I guess power comes at a price in every world.
Wow, you've got another relative with you?
An ice cream stand.
This world is peaceful.
Seems like there aren't.
So I was happy to find you survived.
I've only told a handful of dragons about my survival.
Do you have any plans for today, Kobayashi-san?
Well, just leaving me alone is fine.
a6It's interesting.
a6The meaning of shepherd's purse is...
a6I'll offer everything to you!?
Make us proper normal ones today, please.
Their lifespan is short!
Ah, how sad!
How long are you planning to keep doing this?
One day you will have to go back.
If you wish for battle again?
Father.
She went home.
I totally forgot!
I should've told her the omurice was good,
Why?
I thought you went home.
Father.
I told you. We're forbidden from interfering in this world.
I'm home, Kobayashi-san.
If the dragons charged with defending order found you to be in this world,
That wouldn't be Tohru's fault.
I know that.
I see.
Tohru.
If you defy me, I won't show mercy.
You stubborn child!
Why the hell are you two fighting!?
Of course. Humans could never understand us.
We've already been doing that for a while now.
I don't need that much.
Take care, Shouta-kun.
a6Thank you very much.
Today's the day we run the integration test on that program, huh?
Where did we meet?
The mountains?
Uh...
I'll never forget those kind words!
Please let me work here as your maid!
i1I can't shake this feeling of guilt.
Ahem.
I saw it on the way here.
How's that?
You receive visitors.
No problem!
Come on, now.
Oh, I see. So you're a picky eater, then?
Jeez, you're hopeless.
You don't even know the first thing about being a maid.
Let's start with telling me what you dislike.
My friend, Herensuge, was hit with one and killed.
Wait, why are you asking me what I dislike?
Oh, I can't do that.
Liquor, women, precious stones... That sort of thing.
Surprisingly similar to human tastes.
I must repay your kindness with my entire being!
If anybody calls, please answer.
Understood!
Okay, take care.
Holding the fort?
I was lonely all by myself.
I didn't even get to kill them either.
She's a relative of mine I'm looking after right now.
an8Would you like to come with us?
an8I see. Well, I guess I can't tell you what to drink.
an8It's common practice for schedules to be based on people taking on extra roles.
an8Common practice!
Oh, I'm sorry, Tohru-chan.
Miss Kobayashi?
First of all, what's with your maid uniform?
Here it comes!
but that draws a clear line as local fashion!
While Lolita and maid fashion may lend to one another,
I'm just a dragon. I have no idea what you're talking about.
Huh?
Y-Yes!
I'm a closet otaku, so outings like this are very precious to me.
Yes, I understand.
Aw, it's all gone.
First, I use my clairvoyance to check inside your pockets.
Good.
I won't have that. You have to change sometimes too.
Ah...
Wow!
The chest area is a bit...
You look things up like this.
Well, whatever makes you happy.
Did it hurt?
Peace.
I guess I'm all you need, then!
A castle?
Well, let's start by buying the fish.
Tohru, I think you've got a knack for not understanding human emotions.
an8Getting along well?
i1I guess she doesn't hate us.
Tohru!
an8That was so cool!
It worked out.
I should have told you to hold back more.
i1She must be... She has horns and a tail.
What did you just say?
With your body.
Still, I'm surprised you found this place.
I saw Lady Tohru's fire breath on that cloudy day,
You were careless there, huh, Tohru?
You were holding hands in public!
On our date?
Why you! You... You...
It's not?
Like that, yes.
Kanna, you don't have to be my friend.
Okay, shall we play by ourselves?
How can I sleep!?
So there you have it, Kanna.
i1I've seen it a few times now, but it's still terrifying.
Elephant.
Okay, you lose.
Hmm?
Wha
See ya later!
Societal customs?
She seems to possess a license, but she doesn't have a car.
Well, I suppose she does have a lot of compassion for her friends.
What's he saying?
Magic words.
You can get through most conversations using them, so try to remember them.
And that?
Truth be told, I was on the verge of death,
Come on, Kanna, isn't there more you'd like to know about?
Time for some beer!
The sky's so big!
Are you actually a bit of a clean freak, Tohru?
Brushing your teeth?
No, I dig out bugs with my claws.
It's just so hard to notice them because they're so tiny.
It was so annoying.
That's really lewd by human standards!
Simplegon.
You're evil, Kobayashi.
Miss Kobayashi's so adorable!
Is this yours?
What? Didn't you buy it because you wanted to wear it?
This is my bedroom.
Don't you like it when I clean up after you?
By the way...
I'm coming in too.
Morning, Tohru.
I went to my old apartment!
Please do.
Cooking.
Thank you.
I'm playing music.
I'm stealing it.
I'm using a drill for work.
This is pretty good.
You people are too noisy!
I'm gonna sleep now.
Guess I'll join you.
I hate all that stuff about "keeping it casual" and not being able to pick my booze.
A party?
Yes?
Miss Kobayashi, this is Fafnir.
He's a cursed dragon who's been guarding his treasure in a cave since ancient times.
Long time no see.
Yeah, why?
What!?
Yeah, like that.
Do all dragons have a messed-up past?
Who, Kanna?
I see stuff about that on the Internet all the time.
The Internet, huh?
Uh, well, I was just wondering...
Man, you need all this just to go to school?
Looks like no dice here either.
What the heck?
Miss Kobayashi!
I can see why you'd choose a cursed item that's absorbed human blood.
It costs that much?
What happens when you're different from everyone else?
Everyone's just scared.
Dragon or not, she's still a child, huh?
Annoying.
What's Kanna doing?
Good morning, everyone.
Can I call you Kanna?
What made you want to go to school?
It looked like fun.
Living among them doesn't mean we have to lead the same lives as they do.
Fit in, huh?
What about me?
Yeah. You're so nice, Saikawa.
Hear that? Sh-She'll give us the honor!
You American gorilla!
Wh-What'd you say!?
And you, black-haired mama's boy!
What happened to not getting mad at a kid?
No! This means war!
They looked down on us proud, noble dragons!
Yeah!
What's this, pipsqueak?
i1The results were obvious from the get-go.
Your friends are amazing, Kanna!
i1Wherever did my peaceful life go?
Look, Kanna.
Huh?
I managed not to get yelled at for making any mistakes this morning!
an8i1The secret is to marinate the meat in honey.
Miss Kobayashi.
Christ almighty!
See you tomorrow.
I just had a hunch.
Sheesh.
Asparagus, watercress, fresh potatoes!
I bought a bunch of in-season veggies.
Fafnir!
Welcome back.
Oh, please, help yourself.
So what's going on?
Maybe I should just destroy
supposed to be me?
When you return to our world,
I'll be fine.
The more I treasure what I have right now,
I'm sure I won't regret it.
We'd like to ask your help again.
Why is there no place around to trade gold for money?
Well, my place is a bit small, but...
Are you really sure?
an8i1I will now bend the spoon.
She's a god! Praise the almighty Kobayashi!
i1That reminds me...
i1Humanity cannot be left to their own devices, no matter what!
I see.
Training!
You weakling.
I can't be inferior to them in any way, shape, or form.
i1You're probably not being honest there, Tohru.
You should focus on doing the things only you can do, Tohru.
I really do.
There's not much I can do, then.
an8i1A maid came out of the box!
an8i1This isn't part of the script? Huh?
Hey, gimme a bigger serving.
i1I can't stand this stuff.
i1Extra! Extra! Extra! Extra!
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, this is Twister.
You play by placing your hands and feet on the colors it tells you to, like so.
i1Player two: right hand, blue.
I-I've got loads of those.
Fun, huh?
From the early Victorian era?
The way they hold pride in their work has always made my heart race!
Don't run away!
So she's not a maid, but a maid fanatic?
Huh? Where?
I'm bunking with a human, same as Tohru.
What's the problem?
Hey...
"feathered serpent,"
or "Venusian."
He's always like that when I'm around.
I'm not a demon.
Shouta.
That makes me feel a little bad for her.
How about unmatched charisma?
What? Why?
I feel like there's no point if you don't earn that kind of thing for yourself.
All I have left is my body.
Take a closer look!
Come on, don't look the other way!
I wonder.
Rule.
Sir Fafnir, could you test run this game for me?
What's your level now?
What?
Indeed.
i1humans might as well all be busts who encroach on my home to steal what is rightfully mine.
Let us make haste.
Don't.
Come this way, please. Your swimsuit is too risqu.
Phew, I'm finally back.
You had a spare swimsuit on you?
Ah, I see.
I wanna play already.
I have to agree. I'm more of an indoor person myself.
I-I can't!
That's Kanna for you.
I nearly got myself killed by him once. It was horrible.
get set...
You went overboard!
What's the matter?
Hup.
That's it?
Very well.
There are tens of thousands of people here!
Are you a cosplayer?
I was sure you were a cosplayer from abroad.
i1and keeping them under control?
Crunchy...
Fafnir.
You look like you're dead already.
Come on now...
I'm a maid through and through!
That's an insult to maids.
The sahuagin, goblin, and witch over there...
What?
As long as you keep things on a reasonable level, feel free.
I think it's something you can only find right here, right now.
And everyone here loves it.
I really know that feeling.
Sorry, but could you hurry up?
We managed fine without you in the second half.
Studying you.
Sure. What would you like?
Forget about it, Miss Kobayashi.
I'm a better cook, anyway.
Yeah? And I'm better than that.
Gung-hobayashi.
q2Meanwhile, I made a seafood-and-paprika Caesar salad!
There's no need to even compare.
Very well.
the criteria of a "packed lunch" went completely over your head.
This is unusual.
Man...
What's wrong, Tohru?
Lady Tohru and Lady Elma are on really bad terms.
That's not good!
Anyway!
Let's settle things in this alternate reality I created.
Get over here!
Where am I?
Could you back off?
I could ask you the same, human. What are you doing here?
I work here.
But can you handle this job?
We get paid at the end of the month, and this month just started.
Good work today.
Oh, how do sweet chestnuts sound?
If you'd kindly excuse me!
How's that?
Sleep to your heart's content in this room brimming with freedom!
I'll make breakfast!
Lemme see that butt!
You want to sate your libido along with your hunger?
It's like you've gone back to when you first came here.
Begone, Elma.
I'm doing everything I can to earn your praise.
This is a first for me,
Gladly.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Pull ropes...
Settle for me?
And I understood they had to put keeping the family afloat first.
Kanna's parents took a pretty hands-off approach.
Victory...
Not so much a problem as I just don't believe you.
Dinner will be ready in a bit.
Tohru.
For
Yeah.
Realized you wanted to go?
Realized I should go.
You're picking up the tab next time we go drinking.
Really?
i1What do you want me to do?
i1What should I do?
Do your best!
Don't push yourself.
Next group, get ready.
It's our turn, Saikawa.
Wow, it's normal.
Glad to hear it.
i1What do you want me to do?
i1No, chestnut's hard to pass up.
i1But they might be onto something with this unique grape and pear combo!
Class 3 is out.
Keep going!
i1Class 3-2 takes the win!
Oh, it's starting.
get set...
i1Class 1 currently holds the lead.
Classes 1 and 2 are locked in a dead heat!
i1She's passing the others in rapid succession!
Go!
Um, I'm sorry!
Great job today, Kanna.
Thanks, Kobayashi.
You're very welcome.
Let me in on the fun!
i1Humans are terrifying!
Hello.
Yeah!
Um, what about Kanna's mom?
I came here because you said it was important,
I'm fine with anything.
A play?
Thank you for this opportunity.
Really?
You dare to ignore me?
Here I go.
Me, me!
Come on out, Shouta.
He looks just like a girl.
He's got nothing on Kanna, but yeah.
That leaves the problem of our lead.
i1So I started by making the girl a magical girl
Would you like to buy some matches?
Saikawa said Santa comes in through the chimney.
Most terribly cold it was.
Matches, matches. Would you like to buy some matches?
Now, begin!
You mustn't be fooled by this suspicious man's lies.
You'll pay for toying with people's hearts.
I'm sorry. I meant no harm.
Nobody can beat me in this form.
Who's a sleazy old man now?
You force my hand.
How was our play?
N-No, it isn't!
Huh? Where is everyone?
Oh, right, Miss Kobayashi.
Okay, you can try three times.
Tissues.
I'm home.
Finally! I'm done with work for the year.
Of course. I'm just doing my job as a maid.
Have some mochi we pounded.
Good job.
Don't mention it.
All of these? Thank you.
These tangerines are really sweet.
Yes?
No, it doesn't.
I haven't written one of these in years.
Hey, Kobayashi.
Yeah.
A learning charm?
You bought a sacred arrow?
I may be able to use it to develop a new curse.
As popular as ever, I see.
Georgie, you got great luck.
Well, I guess the only way from here is up.
We should let Shouta and Saikawa's folks know first, though.
There's no time to waste, then!
You really went all-out, huh?
Well, since you made it and all, I guess I'll eat it.
Tohru.
Get that, Tohru.
tsu.
i1You've never sent us a card before.
Yeah.
Yeah, bye.
You wrote it, huh?
I think I get it.
I see.
 Erase it! Erase it all! 
Coming!
Presto!
Oh, it's you, Lucoa?
Do you know any secrets to a good omelette?
Rice omelette ingredients.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
An einherjar told me they're to die for.
Coming up.
Wait, bears?
It's pitch black!
W-Well, yes.
Hey!
Who gives a damn about that!?
I don't really like using this magic, though.
Women!?
What, really?
I'm all alone in this world now.
Where did this rain come from?
Hey, it's too cramped.
By the way, weren't you close to any humans in your world?
I was just lying low for a bit.
I mistook a noble for a merchant and attacked them. Now I'm wanted.
You can fly, and you're strong enough that no one can beat you.
Become a maid!
Choose to of my own free will!
The only choice I've ever had was to either become a slave or a bandit.
I think it's about time.
For now, I'll cross the mountains and go to the neighboring country.
Yes.
All right.
Really? Have fun.
Yeah.
Understood!
Saikawa.
To you, Kanna!
I will. Thanks.
I'm mixing up temperatures and flavors depending how you're feeling at the time.
She went back.
The Emperor of Chaos, Lady Tohru's father, must've come to pick her up.
Crap!
Whoa, nearly forgot!
You sure?
About what?
Yeah.
Wh-What's wrong, Kanna?
I'm home, Miss Kobayashi!
Tohru.
It will slowly eat away at you.
i1But I can't just butt in on a conversation between family.
Got it?
I respect and admire you, Father.
But only as a dragon.
You stubborn fool!
Are you saying you really think you can co-exist?
We've been co-existing for ages now.
Try having faith in your daughter!
That's too much.
I'll be off.
I know.
It's been a while, so I'm thinking about going back home for a change.
i1I'll simply treasure these times we have now.
I drank way too much last night.
i1I'm not waking up for some reason.
We met in the mountains!
Thanks, but no thanks.
I don't really get this whole dragon thing,
No.
i1I can't shake this feeling of guilt.
Can you fly!?
You're damn fast!
i1You know, I can't honestly say I hate the idea of having someone around.
Oh, I'm good at cleaning!
I can handle that too!
And last but not least, cooking!
Yeah, no.
Should I have fried it longer?
It's an insult to both physiology and ethics.
Yeah, maybe in your eyes.
Wouldn't you normally ask what I like?
You saved me, Kobayashi-san!
The other half is...
You stand out!
When it rings, pick it up like this.
That girl's looking our way. You know her?
an8We were just talking about going out for drinks together.
So what? That's exactly what we're getting paid for.
N-No! The level's just so low I don't feel like joining in, that's all!
Damn right!
You really love Kobayashi-san, huh?
Would you like to drink my fresh blood?
Just try them on.
Hello, Lucoa-san?
The one who gnaws on that one tree's roots all year long?
I found you.
Nothing wrong with a bit of smelling, right?
But I want to sleep with you, so I will anyway!
All right, good night.
Nah, it's fine.
Did it hurt?
Welcome home, Kobayashi-san.
Where'd you pick that up from?
This time, tell me what you like!
It seemed like it lacked the necessary firepower.
Like I said, all you need is a small flame, not an inferno.
The shopping district is right here.
We've got some good mackerel in today.
i1I'd like to know more... I guess.
Well, shall we buy some dessert?
Huh? Your parents
Amazing, Tohru-chan!
an8I can sleep soundly tonight!
Yes.
Is my package here?
i1I already invited her in, but...
i1She must be... She has horns and a tail.
Break up with Tohru-sama.
Figured.
Come home with me.
Hey, take this seri
Don't blush about it!
Why are you so pitifully weak?
Come on, look me in the eye and answer.
It's like this?
But we can live together.
Okay.
Well then, would you like to play with me outside today?
No, please come!
Wait, wait, wait!
How can I sleep!?
Don't be silly. We were just roughhousing a little bit.
There's very few, in fact none, who can here.
First, let's try to recall how Kobayashi-san usually acts.
I'm tired! I'm dying!
i1They'd never destroy our world.
You ate everything but my tail meat again!
Kanna, you have things to do with me today, don't you?
Have a good day at work!
Does Kobayashi have one of those license things?
Why doesn't Kobayashi do that?
Yeah, good question...
Wow, another relative moved in with you?
Together, her?
I don't know if they went extinct or if they moved elsewhere.
So I can't revert to my original form?
an8It's all right!
It's not practice for catapults?
Glad to hear it.
Yeah.
Yeah, no problem.
Time for some beer!
Somewhere in the area, if possible.
Hmm...
We'll take it.
 Cleaning, cleaning, la la la. 
sometimes ruins,
What are you, a migratory bird?
If I stayed in one place too long, humans would find me and attack.
I had a hard time bathing at all.
Actually, while we're on the topic,
You leave beer cans scattered about
That's one of the perks of living alone.
It's my place
Hey, Kanna! Focus on packing
Her dead-fish eyes are to die for!
Kobayashi-san?
Go ahead.
Thank you!
You know...
Are you really only a D-cup?
Well, you're not wrong, but...
I'm coming in too.
Thank you so much, Kobayashi-san!
Huh?
Sure.
Some strange noise is too annoying!
Uh, can I say something?
is someone being too noisy when we want some peace and quiet.
I'm gonna lie down for a bit.
Okay.
Guess I'll join you.
What should I do about this?
I hate all that stuff about "keeping it casual" and not being able to pick my booze.
They should be here soon.
He's a cursed dragon who's been guarding his treasure in a cave since ancient times.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Kobayashi.
It makes you look like an exhibitionist.
What!?
Do a backstep once you slash.
He's totally hooked.
I prefer my butlers middle-aged!
They're completely different people when drunk.
If you've got a problem, strip!
That's a mimic.
Why do you instinctively go after all the treasure chests?
I smell a conspiracy.
I'm not so sure about that.
Times may change, but stationery stores never do.
You'll be using pencils, though.
Hey, Kobayashi.
You use it like this.
No way.
And I'm not sure if I want to ask or not.
The memories keeping flooding back to me.
Y-Yeah, it's fine.
There's no way around it.
They all look the same to me.
Why is that?
What happens when you're different from everyone else?
Sometimes you're singled out.
She's practicing her writing.
Good morning, everyone.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
Okay,
What a boring problem.
Good job. That's correct.
Can I call you Kanna-chan?
Hey, you can't bring candy to school.
There's no real need for us to try to fit in with other humans.
But, well...
Good to hear.
Is this...
What about me?
Here.
Look. That guy too.
I'm bored of this game now.
Bring me something else to play.
Wait, wait. What era did you punks come from?
On the way home today...
i1I love you.
It's a hidden gem.
What, you scared of a little ball?
What happened to not getting mad at a kid?
We can probably still talk it out.
Yes!
Don't kill anyone.
i1It went way beyond one-sided domination.
i1It could only be called total annihilation.
No fair, twerp! You'll pay for this!
i1Talk about clichd.
Only one way to find out.
We quickly went from one dragon to four.
i1A drill perfect for woodwork!
How's this?
sometimes ruins,
We don't get sick or unhealthy either way.
you leave your clothes lying where you took them off...
Ahem.
These dead-fish eyes are to die for!
Go ahead.
Yeah, I think it looks good.
Yeah, thanks, you two.
Huh?
This is its own thing.
Here I go!
Here, let me share some.
What's gotten into everyone?
Humans keep making the same mistakes.
Well, anyway, I usually wouldn't mind if I weren't hung over.
Well, then why not create an excuse to refuse?
Come on, don't make that face now. He's a nice guy.
Please wait one moment.
Oh, Tohru!
Your outfit is kind of slutty, though.
I'm just a normal human being.
I'm grateful to Tohru, too.
I didn't use to smile much myself either.
Dragons don't have very good pasts, do they?
Why don't you share some with me?!
If you can't, then strip!
It's my nature.
I made sure to only use ingredients from this world.
Watch out for cars.
You've seemed a lot more cheerful lately, Kobayashi.
Huh? Really?
So they use sound to court their partners?
Kobayashi-san.
I've always wanted to see Kobayashi-san on the job.
i1perception blocking.
But...
Listen up!
Quit dawdling and get it done already!
i1Sh-She doesn't know I'm here, right?
Whoa!
I wanted to know more
All right, everyone.
Do you have anywhere to go?
You're living among them, you know.
I'll give you a chance to prove your mettle.
That's why I did it all for you.
This is my home now.
the sadder I'll be when I lose it.
Money, huh?
Oh no, you don't!
Why is there no place around to trade gold for money?
And if it isn't Fafnir-dono.
Could you let Fafnir-san here live with you for a while?
Oh? Fafnir-dono?
Indeed.
It didn't seem like he used magic either.
What were you trying to do?
Look! Look, Kobayashi!
an8i1Now, I will make this 100-yen coin pass through the cup!
Oh, I see now.
Do you find ESP unusual?
Well done, Kanna!
Come with us, Kobayashi-san!
Do you really need ESP, Tohru?
Listen, Tohru.
I don't want to be outdone by humans!
Huh?
I understand.
Witness me, Kobayashi-san!
What are you, an avatar of destruction?
That's it!
Oh?
Bring over your maid too.
Okay.
Maids have never had one fixed uniform.
What's that?
Blue.
i1K-Kanna-san's so soft!
Such a nice aroma.
It all started with a picture book.
Oh, I've read that book too!
Yeah?
Then...
Don't run away!
Apparently, Georgie-san is Saikawa-san's older sister.
I'm bunking with a human, same as Tohru-kun.
What do you say I show you the place?
Clear things up?
You let yourself be summoned by a ritual some kid did for fun?
Can we really?
Must be Shouta-kun, the boy who summoned me.
Looks like he wants to show who's boss.
Sorry, Lucoa.
You leave me no choice.
Huh? What is it?
Look, I'm not a demon.
Come on, don't look the other way!
Takiya-kun left on time too.
Mild?
I won't lose today.
Weapon acquired!
Victory is mine, it seems.
Indeed. I'm at about the 80 mark, but...
Right here.
What's your level now?
Oh, right, Fafnir-dono.
I'm conking out.
Looks like they're getting along just fine.
Can't wait for the event, huh, Faf-kun
Faf...
Oh, yes!
The rain might not be so bad.
What do you think, Shouta-kun?
i1I-I don't know where to look!
Why'd we come here today, then?
Oh, I know what's going on here!
Oh, whatever.
You bet. It feels amazing to swim to my heart's content.
You went overboard!
I was given an ordinary upbringing.
Is that what a normal human family is like?
Please don't run.
Oh, I get it. You're in character.
Trust me, I feel you.
Seriously, I mean it!
i1I feel like I'm in a firedrake's belly.
Well, this is how the first time goes for everyone.
Uh, it'd be bad news if that thing sold well and went viral!
This is a great chance.
What?
I mean, this world has always had records of famous beings from our world too.
Take Fafnir-san and Lucoa-san, for example.
Uh, I...
Excuse me! Can I get one too?
Not so well, it seems.
Many, many thanks!
Never again!
A free research assignment?
Here too.
Sure. What would you like?
Field Trip...
You're free to pick any ingredients you want as long as you stay within budget.
Ready...
But Contestant Kobayashi's appears to be nothing but cherry tomatoes.
What's keeping Tohru?
I have to take off my shoes.
I'm not going back.
They're like oil and water.
i1I think.
There's the Order faction, which values peace,
the Chaos faction, which desires destruction,
That a fact?
We've never seen eye-to-eye.
Anyway!
Where am I?
All I want is to live a quiet life as a maid in this world.
I'm
Here. Want a cream bun?
Isn't that...
i1I can't make heads or tails of it.
You're working a pretty difficult job, aren't you, human?
I don't have enough power to open a portal.
It's hot, so be careful.
I'm back!
Kobayashi-senpai!
Same to you.
I'll have it down in no time.
Let's grab sweet chestnuts on the way home!
There's absolutely nothing here, like Shiva just passed through.
A place of relaxation has no need for such things!
Put it all back to normal!
What's going on?
Don't you get it?
But I try to hold it in the best I can.
There.
Gladly.
You run...
Throw balls?
And all kinds of other fun stuff as we work together as a class and try to win!
Don't be selfish.
Come to think of it, several of my old classmates actually have kids now.
What's the matter?
If I want to go, huh?
I'm back.
I'll have enough fun working together with my classmates.
So you can just focus on your work.
i1It's the same guilt as back then.
We were so close!
Keep this up and try to take that gold medal home!
Right.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah, really.
All the participants pledge to uphold the spirit of sportsmanship,
i1Next up is the fifth event, the third-grade three-legged race.
Best of luck!
I-I'm sorry, Kanna-san.
Y-Yeah...
i1What do you want me to do?
i1But still...
Class 3 is out.
That's it! Class 2 wins!
They did it!
Yeah, they did well out there.
i1Classes 2, 4, and 3 follow them in that order.
Of course.
Great job today, Kanna-chan.
Kobayashi.
Yeah.
I'm itching to go!
i1Why do human creations force me to make such difficult choices?
Familiar?
Hey there, Tohru-chan.
Are you sure?
B-But I can touch type now!
It's a bit late for that.
Ridiculous.
I don't see the problem.
On a cold winter's night, a poor young girl tries to sell matches on the street.
and her grandmother gently embraces her.
First, let's cast our lead, who will be the play's symbol.
Don't disappoint me.
Then the lines will come out naturally.
Too depressing. Next.
matches.
Really?
Of course!
Coming.
Hello? This is the Kobayashi residence.
i1It's me.
i1The original version shows its age.
Now then, I should get Kobayashi-san's dinner ready.
Would you like to buy some matches?
Do we have a chimney, Tohru-sama?
A chimney?
Yo!
What are you doing?
I don't care!
She gains the power to scorch the corrupted world to ashen ruins.
Amusing.
Can't we have dragons?
Might as well while we're at it, right?
Hey, Grandma!
Oh? Tell me, what makes you yearn for this power?
You would so shamelessly voice your desires?
Fight to the death, and the last one standing will take it!
So you show yourself, Kira!
Well done.
Is that your stomach speaking again?
Huh? Where is everyone?
Best view ever!
It's not every day you suggest we go see the night view.
What's this, a Christmas present?
Honestly, I was worried sick while watching the play,
You deserve an Oscar for that, Fafnir-san.
Cheer up.
Matches.
That trip is mine for the taking!
Tissues.
Yay!
Happy New Year!
Hello, Tohru-chan!
Uh, I made too much sweet potato and chestnuts.
Don't mention it.
I think I know what's coming.
Have some.
Don't mention it. Look at what Sone-san gave us.
Rat, ox, tiger...
Is that a chant?
That really means a lot to me.
New Year's cards?
Not too tight?
That was like magic.
She looks so cute.
You wanna wear one too?
Gotta get some fresh air.
Kanna-san!
I decided to go with something traditional.
Yeah. I used to drink a lot of something like this.
The charms are so pretty, aren't they?
So adorable.
It's okay. That's your fortune, SisGeorgie.
You won't find what you lost."
I wonder what's going on.
Oh, the year ends soon.
11... 10... 9...
Well, since you made it and all, I guess I'll eat it.
The kotatsu really is the best.
It doesn't air during New Year's.
Uh-uh.
You try too.
Hello?
Aw, I went off the canvas!
Yeah.
Is that how human families work?
One, Fuji Lucoa!
i1but my palms are so sweaty they've all disappeared.
i1The contenders have been narrowed down to just two teams.
an8It's fine, Tohru-sama.
Oh, Kobayashi-san.
Actually, don't.
Bathroom, check!
Coming!
Presto!
As for the taste...
Oh, it's you, Lucoa-san?
I brought snacks.
People always complain about me showing off skin, so I toned it down.
Pretty please?
You went back again?
They're damn good!
I thought I could use it to cook the rice, but, uh...
I figured I should use this world's.
I'm beat.
i1Come to think of it,
The deadline's almost here!
I'll fix it at once!
Kobayashi! Help out here!
Drink with me, dragon! And hear me out!
What, really?
I'm all alone in this world now.
The roles differed and required rigorous training! Nothing like those maid cafs
I'm Tohru.
So, Tohru, it's not like I'm saying maid cafs are bad.
I'm home.
Where did this rain come from?
Help me out, Takiya.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't make yourself scarce, I'll kill you.
Sorry.
See?
Just what is my freedom?
Born as a force of chaos,
I live in chaos, and fight the sacreds.
Become a maid!
I'd wear a lovely maid uniform,
I'm sure I'll find something there!
A human, ride me? I should kill you on the spot!
but instead I felt a little sad
I guess.
You used to talk like an old man.
Well, whatever.
It'd be nice if she's doing well.
an8Make sure you're making backups!
This is all me!
What should we have for dinner tonight?
I ask you again.
Father?
Like I said, she's still
Tohru went back to the other world.
Yeah.
Got it. Some other time.
Goodnight, Kanna-sama, Ojou-sama.
I'm home, Kobayashi-san!
You realize that this world is off-limits, don't you?
You must know this already.
i1I should respect Tohru's decision.
I don't want to!
That won't change my mind!
I respect and admire you, Father.
Living with a human is unacceptable!
Stay out of this, human.
Sorry, Kobayashi-san, but please stay away for now.
You run laps from there and keep opening or closing the distance.
You can learn to connect with and trust them too.
I will not accept this.
That's too much.
Morning, Tohru.
Good morning, Kobayashi-san.
It's been a while, so I'm thinking about going back home for a change.
i1I'll simply treasure these times we have now.
My head hurts.
We met in the mountains!
No, that's not the problem...
It's not a dream?
If it's not a dream, then...
Super fast!
How's that?!
Here's my roasted tail!
What I dislike?
Wait, why are you asking about my dislikes?
Please give me a chance!
Kill all you suspect.
Kill them with curses.
Saw what?
Yes, I can drink, stultus.
We're only secondary or tertiary subcontractors, so what can we do?
But when we follow their exact directions, it always causes failures, right?
Ah, I'm sorry, Tohru-chan.
It's hard for you to join in the conversation, right?
She's drunk!
We've got enough french maids. That's just cosplay now.
Hide them!
Y-Yes!
I'm secretly an otaku, so outings like this are very precious to me.
Yes, I understand.
Though I hate you.
Inferior species!
Miss Kobayashi's waste...
Yes, so I don't need to change.
Thank you very much!
Well?
Tohru, what size are you?
The Internet?
Oh!
Have a safe trip.
Yes?
All right.
Welcome home.
Hey, hey!
Tell me what you like this time!
Yup.
Tohru-chan's funny, isn't she?
Huh? You mean it?
She make talk condescendingly, calling humans
Farewell, then.
Good, now that I'm this far away...
I can't believe you're so strong!
Sweet and creamy!
What's your name?
I know that you've seduced her.
Why you!
I knew it!
In that case, I'll kill you if I must...
So right now she's all on her own...
I'm so glad I fell in love with Miss Kobayashi.
There!
Would you like to come, too, Miss Kobayashi?
I hate exercising.
Well, whatever.
I'm going to sleep off the fatigue from my deathma.
Huh? I thought you were going to sleep?
The source of my power is electricity.
Oh, sorry, for crushing your dreams.
If they felt like it, our world would be...
First, you should learn what you must not do.
That's what those iron boxes are called?
Is she a maid, too?
No, a Gothic lolita.
Together?
What's he saying?
Magic words.
And that?
And that?
This world is peaceful.
I'll be waiting here.
Lady Tohru?
I heard you had died...
It's not. It's equipment kids play on.
Glad to hear it.
Beer, beer.
Hmm...
Well, time to start moving preparations.
Weird song.
Brushing your teeth? Do you have a dragon-sized toothbrush?
Sometimes caves,
Wow, I'm kind of jealous.
Ahem.
Understood. I'll overlook the books.
Fine.
So please keep helping out, okay, Tohru?
Though, nearly all of it is my personal belongings.
Lady Tohru, you're a pervert.
It is, but...
I got my arms into it and then despaired at how bad I looked in it.
Go ahead.
Yeah, thanks, you two.
This will be for the PC and books.
Huh? No, it's fine.
Yes.
Ah!
Damn it, I screwed up!
If they won't listen after I speak to them, I'll murder, destroy, and pulverize them.
I'll start with Ms. Sasakibe on our right.
My, was it that loud?
Cooking.
I'm using a drill for work.
The loud one is the one calling people loud!
That strange noise is too loud!
Huh?!
Humans keep making the same mistakes.
So why don't we organize the times we don't want each other making noise,
Well, anyway, I usually wouldn't mind if I weren't hung over.
Okay.
Okay. Then I will, too.
as an excuse to turn down my company's flower viewing.
Come on, don't make that face now. He's a nice guy.
Put up with it?
Welcome, come on in.
Good evening.
Makes me want to end it.
Tohru!
He's a shut-in?!
Good job defeating him.
I'm just a normal human being.
I didn't use to smile much myself either.
Food's ready!
Besides, what's with all of you and your absurd chests?!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hey, Kanna, don't make trouble for Miss Kobayashi!
You need all this just to go to school?
You'll be using a pencil though, Kanna-chan.
How's this?!
No.
I can't help but remember...
Kanna-chan, which one do you like?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry, I'll be paying with card.
Welcome!
so we have no choice.
That's important.
Sometimes you're eliminated.
but humans don't like things different from themselves.
Yeah, I agree it is.
Sorry.
Thanks for your concern.
Kanna-chan, are you looking forward to school?
This is Kobayashi Kanna-chan.
I challenge you, Kobayashi Kanna-san!
Saikawa-san plays dirty and cheats,
Hey, you, be quiet!
Maybe that's why I want to be with them.
Please praise me.
This is...
Miss Kobayashi!
Here.
Putting on name tags.
They said to put them on my things.
You're welcome.
Sorry I keep dropping by all the time.
Today, on the way home...
W-Well, let's play on the seesaw together!
Sorry. We don't have time to play with you.
We won't go easy on you.
Where did my peaceful, daily life run off to?
Well, whatever.
Saikawa, you're wicked.
Okay, time to start class.
Just like birds.
One of my 48 maid skills: perception blocking.
It's actually magic
Ah.
But...
Humans may gather together, help each other, and accomplish many things,
but their civilization could be easily destroyed by dragons.
Chief's pushing his work onto Kobayashi-san again...
The chief's project isn't even that vital.
Show more motivation!
Tohru.
Not at all!
Who did that?
Friend.
Asparagus, watercress, new potatoes!
Since we got them cheaper than planned, I guess I'll buy some snacks for Kanna.
Oh, forget about that stuff.
Please leave it to me, Mr. Fafnir!
That doesn't make sense.
Then...
I'm fine.
Oh, if it isn't Kobayashi-san's maid.
About that...
Tohru-dono!
So, Mr. Takiya.
Well, it's a little cramped, but...
I know I'm one to talk, but this dragon's fairly dangerous.
Was Mr. Fafnir really worried about me?
i1Incredible! How did it happen?!
Hey!
ESP?!
Anyone can do them once they learn how.
To be able to when they try. What crafty, lazy creatures.
Oh, that's a book I bought long ago.
I see. So if you do this, then power enters your hand.
Well, I'm free, so sure.
Will I actually learn how to do it by doing this?
That's your horn, right?
Huh?
Once you understand, it's simple, isn't it?
Right.
I understand.
i1Now, the beautiful lady has entered the box. Please watch.
Want to come play at my place next time?
Is it fun?
Plus we have our own maid, too!
You know, the one who joined us for dodgeball.
All right.
Do I look that old?
I'm humbled by your discerning eye.
Huh?! Miss Kobayashi, please don't be swayed by this strange maid!
Player one, left hand, yellow.
Mm.
Blue.
Is it first flush?
I know that much!
Georgie-san, what led you to like maids?
How about this game?
Huh? Oh, sure.
Okay.
I-I-I'm so happy!
Hey, Saikawa.
I'm living at someone else's house, just like Tohru.
Huh?
Ah, we're here.
This is Shouta's house.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm still responsible for spreading civilization far and wide,
How do you get Venusian?
She invited people here!
A-A familiar can't be acting on their own!
N-No way...
Y-You're just bluffing to make yourself seem more powerful, aren't you?!
In this world mages are living quiet lives, but one day we'll return to our original world.
you can't take her with you to elementary school,
Isn't this implying I should leave?
I found out from the pictures of him, but...
Well, Kobayashi-san, see you later.
Thanks for today.
I'm hungry anyway.
Takiya-kun went home at the regular time, too.
Huh? Where?
Nyami-nyami.
And I can obtain a limited edition item at that event, right?
Got the weapon!
The game you're selling at Comiket again?
About here.
Can't you add anything to this part?
Mild?
Faf...
The teruterubouzu aren't working at all.
That's the same, then.
Oh, that works for your swimsuits, too?
Next is watermelon splitting.
You're on.
ready,
Not bad, Kanna.
Impressive, Lady Tohru.
You went overboard.
Okay!
What's next?
Well... Miss Kobayashi...?
the humans of this world could accept dragons?
Oh, you've hooked something, Miss Kobayashi.
Huh?!
What on Earth is this?!
By the way, was leaving Kanna behind a good idea?
Please don't run.
Oh, I get it.
Wonderful.
I understand your policy.
You could curse someone to death if you read this!
Those three are real non-humans.
Huh?!
Oh? You, too?
Run!
Please don't run!
She never learns.
Huh?!
Excuse me.
i1We'll see you again in winter!
I'm back.
So how was it? What'd you think of your first Comiket?
Here.
Yeah. Field trip, next week.
Yes. I'm the best!
Don't underestimate the master of the house, Tohru!
Use all your skills and entertain me!
Kobayashi's into it.
Mine's a seafood and paprika Caesar salad!
There's no comparing the two.
Here.
I'm heading off.
Take care.
Yeah.
What's wrong, Tohru?
Like cats and dogs.
Good girl.
By force, if I have to!
You cheated!
The field Kanna and I played in before.
I'm happy as long as I can quietly be a maid in this world.
Oh, my.
What's this?!
All right! I'm energized now!
This is where I work.
What is this box?
But I've memorized romanized character input or whatever, too,
Here.
A dog?
An office romance?!
Well, you've still got a ways to go.
How's that?!
Even the furniture's...
Kobayashi.
Hold it right there!
What meat's in
I can't.
Miss Kobayashi! Good morning!
It turned out well, so.
So that's it.
wanting lots and lots of praise.
Often I think human relationships are just confusing.
I'll make you a protective charm, too.
Elma, you...
Th-They're good, though!
Saikawa, what's a sports festival?
A sports festival is a very fun event!
Oh!
Also, what is a sports festival?
Make do?
You don't want to?
Would you give
Lady Tohru, perception blocking.
It seems that Kanna went to your work today and was secretly observing you.
I've felt this feeling before.
Thirty-nine!
No.
Really?
Whoa.
Where, where?
Ready!
Thank you.
But this lunch really is good.
Begin!
Get them!
Don't lose!
Right now Class 1 holds the lead. Behind them are Class 2, Class 4, and Class 3.
Wow, Class 2's really fast!
Goal!
That was incredible, Kanna-chan!
But you must feel unsatisfied, not being able to go all out.
It was hardly anything at all.
I'm the maid Josie, servant of the Saikawa family.
Yeah.
Huh? Are you hurt?
Y-Yeah...
that you're still useless at work.
We could play a VR FPS, FFA.
You haven't proposed anything yourself!
Stone stage?
It's famous.
That's not it either!
To be blunt, you're only director by elimination, because you can't act.
Number One, Tohru!
You foolish, inferior humans!
What are you doing?
What should we do?
Matches.
Hey!
What's this?
What are you doing?!
Hmph.
Well...
Why don't we try mixing in other myths too, like the kasajizou?
Have it selling hats next to the girl.
What a mean man.
It was an awfully cold night.
Huh?
I'm cold.
Oh. Then burn one of these to warm yourself.
They're burning it?!
to become a magical girl with a duty to bear.
He doesn't think to heal her with magic?
So you show yourself, Kira!
I got you some medicine that works well for lower back pain.
Hmph.
What's that?
Don't use magic.
I did it!
The train's leaving now.
This year's work is finally over.
i1The New Year's parlor trick tournament will be on January 3rd.
No, these are my natural duties as a maid.
Hmm?
Well, if I have to...
Have some if you'd like.
Thank you very much!
Yes, yes. Hello?
This many? Thank you very much!
Good job.
Thank you very much.
This rooster is well made.
What's a zodiac animal?
It came up when I was searching the net for all things New Year.
reached God fastest on the morning of the new year, right?
It doesn't.
A kimono?
I'm glad my kimono fits you.
but going outside for a change is nice.
So cute!
I heard you could eat lots of unusual food here.
Hmph.
Matching?
O-Of this r-relationship charm.
A charm, huh?
How cute!
Great curse.
Thirteen, twelve,
six,
one!
Happy New Year!
Just climb in with us.
The kotatsu's the best.
I got to see the first sunrise of the year with Kanna-san, so this should be a good year.
Yes.
I can't step away right now.
i1The contenders for the win have been narrowed down to two teams!
Boring.
Looks fun.
Okay!
Lady Tohru, don't worry.
What do I do?!
Occasionally we chat on the phone.
You're not going to go see them?
Take care!
Huh? What are you talking about?
The Internet? You've gotten used to it, huh.
What, Kobayashi?
You said it.
Jeez, you don't get it, Miss Kobayashi.
Kanna-chan, which one do you like?
I'm sorry, I'll be paying with card.
They all seem the same.
But everyone's afraid...
I kind of understand.
Yeah.
All right then. Once we get home, we prepare for tomorrow!
Yes, yes.
Too many different themes to tell.
No co-signer needed Same-day financing Earn Fortune Money Boyfriend Cosigner Repay
Yes. Now, for this problem,
can you solve it, Kobayashi-san?
You can do anything, can't you?
I'll prove I'm better than you!
Saikawa-san plays dirty and cheats,
Here, I'll give you some candy.
Maybe that's why I want to be with them.
Please praise me.
You can hang it on your backpack.
i1A drill perfect for woodwork!
did things get like this?
Kanna-san.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, we were playing dodgeball.
You hear that?
Huh?
I thought you weren't going to take a child seriously?
I think you can still negotiate with them.
I could see how it would end when it started.
He's beat up...
From that point on,
the playground became a battlefield.
Oh, that's wicked.
Oh, that's wicked.
Okay, time to start class.
That's wicked!
I'll be happy anywhere if I'm with you, Saikawa.
Here's your hot milk, Kanna.
Thank you for all your work.
It's not that it isn't good, but...
Hey.
Yeah, all right.
This chicken is expensive, isn't it?
Hereabouts should be good.
Ingredients for our omurice.
What eggs are these?
Roar, roar, roar, roar!
It's done, Miss Kobayashi!
it's... good...
Another, man!
How pathetic that the last being I meet is a human.
Huh? Well...
I'm truly grateful.
Drink!
Yes, I am.
That's right, you tell them! Let me bring an end to it all!
Miss Kobayashi, welcome home!
The omurice was delicious,
Well, allow me to talk about my former self a bit.
Hmm?
Yes. A maid.
Yeah.
Bug off! I'll never let a human ride me!
For being with me.
You're right.
Who knows?
It's interesting.
Here you go, Miss Kobayashi.
It's because I'm me.
I'm heading out.
Okay.
Are you me?
Don't deceive yourself.
And with that...
and spend time with Miss Kobayashi, that's all...
You understand, don't you?
I don't think she'll come back to this world anymore.
be1Episode 13
Oh, Yamashita-kun.
About those revisions...
Sorry I'm late.
I'm home.
Tohru.
I told you. We're forbidden from interfering in this world.
One day you'll fray apart.
Before you get hurt.
Is it okay if I speak up?
Umm...
kobayashi-sanMiss Kobayashi!
Tohru said she doesn't want to go back!
But I can leave you just shy of death.
Tohru's a great girl!
She's bright and cheerful,
I respect you, Father.
This is your last chance. Come home.
I won't go back!
Then you can forge both trust and bonds.
Do you genuinely believe you can live alongside her?
I believed it would.
Everything. I'll give you everything!
In that case, I'll prepare chocolates.
Oh, sounds nice.
Will you come with me?
I'm home.
No co-signer needed Same-day financing Earn Fortune Money Boyfriend Cosigner Repay
Miss Kobayashi! Kanna! Breakfast is ready!
Yes, watch out for cars!
Hmm, so they pursue love with sounds.
Miss Kobayashi.
i1Early this morning, there was a fire in Tatsumi-cho, Nishi-ku.
Sorry, but could you help me out here?
What's wrong, Kobayashi-san?
Takiya?!
Let's go drinking again.
I told you get it done right away, didn't I?
Listen!
Quit slacking off and get it finished quickly!
Serves him right.
Don't talk back to me!
Sorry.
Wh-Who is it?!
Yes!
Someone sent the director a recording of proof.
I've decided to live in this world for a while.
Why do I have to sneak around and hide from humans?
Oh, forget about that stuff.
You're growing too close to humans now.
You think they're worth speaking so highly of?
So, Mr. Takiya.
Oh, Fafnir-dono?
I knew Miss Kobayashi wasn't just an ordinary person!
Indeed!
I can't forgive humans!
Oh, I'll fix your spoons first.
This is, at least. But there are some things that aren't that way.
So, Tohru, you should focus on the things only you can do.
I'm going to show you a power only I can use!
Then there's not much I can do.
We're likely to have leftovers, so here's extra.
That's not magic.
I'm sorry Aoki-sensei!
Please forgive me for making fun of you.
Kokonoe!
No!
Sensei!
Oh, you mean "Everybody get along?" Okay then.
Who's imagining what?!!
Although, speaking of being a goody-good, I'm starting to miss how he'd yell out "Kokonoe!"
The kids are gaining so much skills and knowledge from those club activities!
Come ON, Shiro-CHAN!
Is Shirai a kid again?
Shiro-chan?
You need to do something about that Kagami kid!
Just a second, Aoki-sensei?
Shiro-chan!
I agree!
Since you are Shiro-chan, you get a white rose! 
Still, Shiro-chan, I wish you had better fashion sense.
What?! As if! That girl is such a drag!
What's there to get?
T'whaa-?
Shiro-chan, you don't put on a fake smile, and I love how you don't humor us kids!
Huh?
Do not worry.
If you don't think about it, you'll turn out normal by the time you grow up.
Hoin-sensei!
Everybody, a good morning to you.
Now then, for our children, it's almost time for Field Day. I hope everyone will work hard and practice towards the goal . . .
Why you little-!
Hey, settle down! Be quiet!
Stoppit!
In my mind it's always Sunday. I love you!

Please, only wear those clothes inside the house.
Hold on!
Okay, Sensei, let me say something.
...Bottom...slave?
Does she have you that spooked?
Huh?
Here, eat off my body!
When did I say that?
I'm always causing trouble for Sensei.
I don't have a problem saying things to Sensei that no one can tell him
So don't worry about it, Mimi-chan! Okay?
Huh? Cleanup?
But your backpacks aren't in the classroom...
That's Rin-chan for you. Nice idea, huh?
By the way, where's Rin-chan?
Rin-chaan!
Sorry, sorry!
Ko... Kokonoe!
I can handle these things.
All wrong!
Aaargh, what should I wear...?
Found it!
Listin, Rin...
But...
I want to be a good father to you this time.
Rin, where is he?!
Reiji!
Well, I'll be coming home early today.
Study hard, okay?
First up...
Ugh, she forced her into it...
All right.
If there are lots of people who want to do a job, we'll decide by rock, paper, scissors.
Then I guess you're not going to bite my ears anymore?
Yes sir!
What are you gonna make?
Hey, Rin-chan, what do you want to eat?
This is amazing!
Tastes great!
All right! We're getting ice cream!
Hey, Rin-chan...
I'm always causing trouble for Sensei.
So don't sweat it, Mimi-chan! Okay?
Bye-bye!

Maybe you thought I was gonna bite you like before?
Doesn't being a nurse's aide sound fun to you?
You really are a liar.
Bottom... slave?
There's something I'd like to get your advice on...
Oyajima-sensei, you're always defending Shirai-sensei.
Oh, it's not... uh...
Sensei! Look again!
I wanna eat croquettes!
How do you make gratin?
This is amazing!
Isn't it?
Ours too!
Hey, Rin-chan...
Did you become class president just for me?
Uh... okay.
Everyone got their backpacks?
Hey, wait... Kokonoe!
Ahh! I'm beat!

Mm-hmm, you're right about that.
At best, you have one issue to talk about for fifteen minutes.

You were right here all along!
Here, pass these behind you.

Aoki-sensei...
It's because...
Ka-Kagami, hey!
Ah, Kuro-chan!
But you and Mimi-chan were the ones who went off...
F-forgive me. For being abrupt.
I am the teacher of class 3-1 at Futatsubashi Elementary.
If you please.
The fact is, Rin used to live with her mother in this house, just the two of them.
It is just Rin and I, the both of us.
And what do you mean by that?
Really?
All right, Kokonoe. I'll be seeing you tomorrow.
Okay!
Yep!
an8Ah, nekomimis again.
That's for me . . .
. . .cide.
But, there must be a way to include effort into the grades, however intangiblefscx200-
Sensei.
Yep!
Be sure to help out around the house!
Now I feel let down when they start.
I know how you feel.
Mimi-chan, can you rub some oil on me?
I'm going back to the office. If anything happens, send me a text.
I'll see you later!
Er, um, the looks and size of the one-piece doesn't match up with me.
So... So that's what it is?
"Kuro-chan went to her grandmother's house while Mimi-chan went to her father's place."
Today we're having a fireworks display in the neighborhood park.
I've had just about enou...
If I don't find those two quick, the fireworks will...
Showing up at school without notice.
You're right about that, but like this?
That's stupid. You'll catch a coldfscx200-
Your jersey is so baggy!
I'm fed up, with all my might, I hit C, am Im flying?
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go
I can't resist, I've been dreaming of it ALL NIGHT.
More, more?
Nuh-uh, no way, I don't want.
When I hear your true desires
I dunno what I'll do from there.
You are so thickheaded, you'll never understand.
Sensei!
Quit shaking me, Kokonoe! I'm busy now, we can do it later!
Anywhere you play, you are going to make new discoveries.
However that may be, test scores shouldn't be everything!
What's bothering you-?
Yep!
I'm already wearing bloomers!
Be sure to help out around the house!
Rin-chan, let's get going!
This blows.
No, not at all. It's just...
I think it's unfair!
She does have a point. Aoki-sensei, I'm going to go back and change.
Are you in heat or something?
After this, you do your armpits.
"Today I did my schoolwork at home."
I agree, let's stop here.
So I was thinking we should set up patrols.
The festival is also coming up...
That's wrong!
Look, it's getting dark, it's time for you to go home.
If I do that... you'll...
Sensei...
I can always stay here.
an8Yeah, notice the position of the cotton candy.
It's boring without Rin-chan around.
Um... er... you got the wrong idea!
Come on, Kokonoe let's get out!
We're not at the pool, so we don't have to wear school swimsuits, right?
If you listen to me then MAYBE
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go
ED
...shimmer brilliant.
Oh my. And they say he hasn't been going to school either.
It time too eet.
I'm going to be late coming home from work tonight. Could you do me a favor and pick up Rin for me?
I should have kept that to myself.
In your mind, you still have a mother and father.
You look fantastic, and very... hand... some...
I'll see you later.
You're right! It's saying "whoosh, whoosh!"
Yes, very good.
Let's stop here.
You need to recover.
Why did you keep this from me?
Good girl!
At least until she...
...enters grade school.
Rin... Rin?
I suddenly want to go back home.
I will never forgive anyone who will hurt Rin.
I will never let anybody... anybody... lay a hand on Rin.
"Kimi no tame da nante iu kedo."
Atama katai ne wakattenai.
Kawaiku omowaretaku naru no.
You have to feel for him.
Why won't you divorce him already?
Let's leave this house.
Hey! Rin wait!
Reiji?
Are you sure about this?
Yes, thank you.
Ah! I can see it!
Please, before now you've always wore a school uniform.
Protect Rin for me.
I will protect you too, not just Rin.
Keep going.
Please, Aki-san. Take the treatment.
Yes I have!
Right now, the cancer has metastasized into her liver.
I'm sorry.
When I hear your true desires
Huh?
Be quiet!
Gather round!
Okay!
"After lunch, do recreational activities, bring the stuff to the cabins, make curry..."
What the hell? Uppity little virgin!
Hey, let me down, you moron!
Sensei, what about our lunches?
Oh, yeah... just wait a little longer!
Hmm?
You're such a Nazi!
Eh?
Ooh, wow!
Outdoor schools are all about boys trying to peek in on baths.
They'd always hide themselves around here in order to snoop...
No pillow fights!
And this last one...
Not a muscle!
No, um....
No, you're really right about that.
It's a miss!
The fifth one has to be around here!
i1Still...i0
I wonder where Rin-chan went?
Ah!
A HEART BEAT that is so loud
fscx86It will totally, surprisingly, and completely attract you, doncha think?
I can smell the lie from here.
I dunno what I'll do from there.
Huh?
an8White is Right.
Odejishi... Odejishi.
Sensei, where's your love of nature?
Ugh, you're so uncivilized.
Not to mention a parasol!
Okay!
Please wait a second!
Oh, yeah... just wait a little longer!
Oh!
Gee Sensei, you sure know how to peel skin!
...things will be a lot easier if I became a salaryman instead of a teacher.
Okay!
And I thought she was stuffing while wearing a Wonder Bra or something!
Sensei...
Hmm?
Huh?
What can you do?
Hold up!
I'm going to the bathroom.
At 3:00 at night...
No ghost stories!
No Sabbats!
an8I'd make an "Aria" reference, except I can't stand that boring franchise.
You are such a good little boy-
Be quiet!
I wonder where Rin-chan went?
That's just your drool!
For you, right now we'll have our WEDDING.
Kiss you with love? That's a big NO NO! Adult thinking.
A HEART BEAT that is so loud
So I'll just kiss you warmly.
Oh, I'm having flop sweats!
Naru no
Reiji...
The ones that are least revealing...
Yes, good morning!
She quit once she became married, now living a woman's ideal lifestyle.
That's because Houin-sensei is herself a woman.
Anyway, little girls should not be getting too close to their teachers. Is that clear?
Nobody gets lovey-dovey with someone from the same sex... uhfscx200-
Rin-chan as... my very own...
I just knew public schools were filled with dumpy loser kids!
Which girl?
But Kuro-chan really is cute.
Why aren't you talking to us?
...what are you all doing?
Whoops!
She doesn't smile... she doesn't cry... and she doesn't say a word.
She's my doll.
Huh, you're going to change her here?
Rin-chan, you can talk?
Didn't you?
The heart and body are connected.
Uh, um... about yesterdayfscx200-
Sensei, good morning!
I wonder if that's how it'll feel if Rin-chan were really a boy?
If Rin-chan were really a boy...
Mi... Mimi-chan?
I'll let you borrow my T-shirt.
Oh, who was it?
Ye... owch!
Embrace their hearts along with the rest of them.
I wonder if I can do that without messing up?
And I just told her to go to bed.
I knew it, it's still too much for her.
Kitto kotoba ja tsutawarenai
Mou, mou?
Sore wa watashi ga . . .
The t-shirt with culottes.... or the tank-top with the miniskirt...?
The t-shirt and culottes!
Good morning!
an8I thought I heard baby talk, did you?
Nah, I feel like we spent the entire summer break seeing each other-
Nogi-sensei?
She was Shirai-sensei's contemporary.
That's because Houin-sensei is herself a woman.
Sensei....
It's getting bigger... and bigger...
Just playing with ya!
Kokonoe Rin.
No, it's fine, she doing it as a boy.
an8Yes, the only reason she's not in a fancy-pants private school for rich spoiled girls is that they won't allow her to cos-play.
She's right!
Oh, I know why!
Is Kokonoe...
Okay, now close your eyes.
Rin-chan really does looks like a doll.
Rin-chan, you can talk?
My mo... ther's...
Sensei!
Uh-huh. My... mo... ther's...
Aoki-sensei.
The heart and body are connected.
What do we do... if the kid has no parents.
Kokonoe!
Sensei, good morning!
Oh, yes... good morning!
Bye!
Mi... Mimi-chan?
Eh?!
No you're not.
I guess you got mad after I said little girls shouldn't get too close.
I was wrong.
Don't tell me...
And I just told her to go to bed.

On that day, I'll be sure to record those glorious, once-in-a-lifetime moments!
Sorry... boy.
I wonder if that was alright...
Okay...
Act as mean as you can!
You really think you'll beat Class 1?
Thank you!
Ah! A bunny girl would be good, too!
This isn't a joke!
Kuro-chan said she's going to do her best.
Okay.
Kokonoe!
"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get my work done in time no matter what I did."
Mimi-chan!
That's my girl, Megumi! Don't let up, keep going Megumi!
"You're an expensive child..."
Ohh, you spilled them? I'll help!
By the way, this is my costume.
The warrior of love... Saint Rose!
No one will recognize me in this...
Whafscx200-r?
So the next event is the fourth-grade relay...
Let's go! You're up.
Of course! Usa... more like U-suck!
I'm sorry, Rin.
You have too many responsibilities!
Don't push yourself...
Even when I'm with someone
Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba, ba-da

It's so mortifying don't you think?
That's for me . . .
to . . .
. . .cide.
N... No. You're embarrassing me.
Aw, you're so uptight, Mimi-chan.
Recently, we've had children sneak out of class during lessons and leave school grounds during breaks.
Huh?!
What's your problem!
Hmm?
Ko... Kokonoe...!
No way! Of course I don't have a boyfriend!
All right, I'll be seeing you later.
Okay!
Which would mean he didn't make a move because he thinks I'm hot enough to have one?
Oh, no! I'm glad!
Uh, yeah. For some reason.
We can continue tomorrow. You better get home.
Ah!
I hate you so much.
Well, I do have some areas to improve upon, but I do what I'm able tofscx200-
I'm afraid I cannot trust you people to take care of her.
I guess this what it means to be left utterly dumbfounded.
I wonder what happened to him?
It'll be boring without Sensei.
She's... so cool!
Does Sensei really have a cold?
What we did yesterday probably went too far.
Rin-chan, wait!
We just, thought we'd pay you a visit.
I have to say this place is a pigsty!
Hmm?
Oh no you don't! You must eat something!
Kuro-chan?
Pain, pain, fly away...
Houin-sensei!
Uh, no... those werefscx200-
Okay, then I think we can use them for something...
Oh, looks like we got more growing children to feed.
Sensei!
Such unreliability leads to student contempt!
"You really are a kid, aren't you?"
BU! BU! BU!
LUCKY I gobbled down your earlobe.
BU! BU! BU!
More, more?
I don't want to see you cry, Rin-chan.
I want to lick off those welling tears, to wipe them away for you.
That's right. I may have been too easy on them.
All right. This time around I'll be more strict.
From now on, I won't be easy on you guys.
Good for you, ya nerd.
I still have my respectability.
Don't bring everybody into this!
Even if it's independent study, the period hasn't changed yet!
Go on, hurry!
Oh, it's all right. If we have eat something, we could do a family restaurant.
No way! Of course I don't have a boyfriend!
Huh?
I guess I'm not that hungry.
Like... I... said, those kinds of games are not-
Kokonoe!
Ko-!
It is because there is a problem that we contacted you in the first place.
Doesn't Shirai freak you out?
She's just an old bag.
It'll be boring without Sensei.
Any cellphone, manga and gaming device that I see will be immediately confiscated.
You said it.
Say, Rin-chan...
You all showed up out of nowhere!
We just, thought we'd pay you a visit.
It is ideal in a sense for teachers to be close to their students.
Oh, I forgot the avocado dip!
Hmm?
Kuro-chan?
Mimi-chan, let's go!
"These kids..."
"You really are a kid, aren't you?"
Hmm?
fscx86It will totally, surprisingly, and completely attract you, doncha think?
I'm fed up, with all my might, I hit C, am I'm flying?
More, more?
Akanbe
Oh, there they are!
Thank you, Kokonoe.
Although a lot has happened, I feel that I've finally found my stride.
What's going on, Reiji?
You're working hard just for me.
Rin, do you want some dessert?
Cuts like these will heal faster if you lick them.
You're no fun.
Answer me!
If you think I'm just a kid, then you should be fine looking at me now!
It's only because you say all those mature stuff despite being a kid!
Uh, excuse us!
Just forget it, Mimi-chan.
Quit dawdling!
Waifscx150-r!
We'll see you again!
I mean, I was going about like I understood the situations of all the other kids.
If only I had experience with women, I probably wouldn't be so bewildered by those antics.
Whenever I look at you... I feel uneasy.
You're just super-pissed that I barged in on your date with Houin-sensei!
P... Pickles?
Hmm?
Riaru ni otome no panchi kiita kana
Kuyashii no na ni mo kamo
Naru no
an8Pussy.
Oh, what's up?
I'll come with you. I want to see Shiro-chan!
The clothes a kid wears reflect the thinkings of the parents.
Children who wear the same clothes every day have special needs.
Let's go!
Hey, what should I do?
Ohfscx250-r
an8If the boys aren't laughing at her now...
Hey, next time I should wear Kuro-chan's clothes, and then Mimi-chan can wear my clothes...
And Kuro-chan will look all baggy in Mimi-chan's clothes!
Hey, Rin-chan...
Reiji...
R-Reiji-san just... said my name!
Mimi-chan...
Plus I'll be coming in late.
Oh, certainly.
Sensei...
If you don't, I'll tell Reiji you took off my panties!
Her abnormally mature speech patterns...
If you think I'm just a kid, then you should be fine with looking at me now!
Then why is your face so red?
Hmm?
Hmph!
We'll see you again!
In that case...
What are you saying?
Kokonoe's...
Uneasy?
and sort of excited...
I wanna eat them right now.
Can you help me?
You're just super-pissed that I barged in on your date with Houin-sensei!
...scares me.
I like to challenge myself!
Okay, Henmi!
Tell me...
Mm-hmm! Oh...?
Hell yeah, I also got what it takes!
Tabetai nara osusume tennen dayo
Baby, won't you haaaa . . .
It's so mortifying don't you think?
If you spoil me, I'll just take advantage of it.
Naturally.
Stop...
"You eat us out of house and home, and here you are playing?!"
Hear my voice!
Don't hate them.
That's right...
Here it comes!
All right!
Team 1A versus Team 2B.
I feel... kind of sorry for him.
He isn't anything like him.
Huh?
Go ahead and feel them!
Let's go!
If we win this one, we'll be champions!
Yeah!
Here... we... go!
I can't do stuff right because you keep staring at me with those horndog eyes of yours!
My br-breasts are swollen!
U-Usa... -san?
I won against Aoki-sensei!
So that means she's still mad at me?
Uh, nah.
Be careful!
Protect Rin for me.
You had to be so lightly dressed.
Hmm...
Hmm?
But...
Aoki-sensei?
Let's go, Rin!
Apologize to Aoki-sensei!
Kokonoe Rin is not your only student.
If you're discombobulated, how will you deal with your other students?
Well then, good night.
Please, listen to me! Ifscx200-
That's dangerous, forceful - GO! IN!
fscx86It will totally, surprisingly, and completely attract you, doncha think?
LUCKY I gobbled down your earlobe.
More, more?
"You better keep your promises!"
de . . .
"Reiji, listen to your father."
I forgot.
Hmm?
Virgin!
I can't do stuff right because you keep staring at me with those horndog eyes of yours!
Class One was supposed to pick up the balls in the gym, correct?
Ugh, you were too slow, Sensei!
Don't worry.
Your heart is beating really loud.
Again with that stuff...
Hmm?
Why so stupid, Kyouko?
Why would Kokonoe ask for so much from me.
But...
I'll be here for you.
Se-Sensei?
7... 11... 13... 17... 19... 23...
Where are you?
Rin!
Reiji!
Kokonoe!
Stop this instant!
Then act accordingly.
Since we couldn't do it during summer break, we'll be together for quite a while.
I'm fed up, with all my might, I hit C, am Im flying?
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go
I can't resist, I've been dreaming of it ALL NIGHT.
If you wanna taste, go ahead and try it on the fly
Baby, won't you haaaaave . . .
That lolicon's actually going after Rin-chan?
You still think... Aoki is a masochist?
I want to go to school!
There was a restaurant right over there.
"I'll be here for you."
What're you doing? Hurry and hit the books!
Why?!
You're the one who doesn't understand!
Come on, open up! Reiji!
Not good. Kids, oddly enough, can pick up on these things.
U-Usa?
This is Aoki-sensei's moment of truth.
He didn't notice that we're practically the same age.
At some point I...
I put Reiji in shock, didn't I?
Kokonoe...
I only go by what I've been through.
Well... I was raised in a normal home, went to a normal college...
Hmm?
Sensei is the first adult I believed in.
What was that?
Kokonoe?
Kokonoe...
Okaay..
Not to mention being a stand-up adult.
Even if you didn't share a raw lip lock.
an7koi wa ikutsu kara hajimeru mono nan daro?
an7saseteyo
an7I want to do that.
an7Keep it so
It sucks that Rin-chan's off from school.
H-Hey, virgin!
Sensei, that's for language arts!
But, I'm not very good at that.
Aoki-sensei...
Sensei is... waiting for me.
What're you doing? Hurry and hit the book!
Why?!
Why?!
It's best to do what your father says.
My...
One of these days, Rin will understand that.
Where do you think you're going?
You're the one who doesn't understand!
I'm going to head out for a while.
Reiji is...
Huh?
You see here...
Oh you...
Huh, I wonder if it kills off the uterus too?
Aoki-sensei!
That's not true.
Kokonoe wouldn't agree to something like that.
We discussed your transfer.
Rin!
Kokonoe!
That was it, huh?
Aki...
Protect Rin for me.
But still, I...
You've taught me a lot, Kokonoe.
But you also taught me that it's never too late to learn.
Aoki-sensei...
I think I'll get going.
She doesn't use any rough language, but she's still excellent at badmouthing.
Kokonoe?
Okaay..
But while we rest, and while we stumble
an7senbiki koetemiseru wa
an7Both my fantasies and imaginations were betrayed
Huh, why's that?
Huh? Kuro-chan, what would you do if you got richer than you already are?
Wow, it has his height and chest measurements!
That's his sitting height? It's like he's a Neanderthal.
Huh?
Then... is it alright if we kiss?
We... might work something out...
ki-ki....
ki... ki....
Then it's fine.
Well, I'll be working upstairs, so enjoy yourselves.
It must be nice to have someone like that around.
Mimi-chan, don't you have an older brother?
Come on, cheer up!
Say that again?!
What about you, Mimi-chan?
So then I got a Seashell Bikini card!
Baryudes Esputora Reonirarera...
Okay then. Lights out!
But she's okay being naked in front of him, and he kisses her goodnight...
Besides, Reiji's already has someone he loves.
Yeah.

Now I can exploit all his weaknesses!
fs24an8It's amazing how Kuro hasn't called Aoki a virgin all throughout this episode. I guess the producers were still trying to nail down her character.
What're you kids doing?
She's ten years ahead of herself.
Too bad it's only her body that's grown up.
And now we have to put up with this place turning into a playground...
Argh. It's a double.
I think a necktie or something would be good.
Mm-hmm...
Is that Aoki-sensei?
Yeah, we called a little while ago.
I'm not cute at all!
Here.
Oh! Thank you...
Seriously, it was already messed up to begin with.
Rin-chan...
What?
Is there any shampoo?
Don't cut yourself, okay?
Rin-chan?
What?!
I'm not telling!
Tell us already!

Yep, looks like.
Uh, 23.
Huh?!
Since he was all skin and bones, I've been leaving him some of my school lunch.
Why not?
What's up? Haven't gone home yet, huh?
If I were to scream "Help me!" right here and now . . .
I was getting tired of waiting.
If you ever reveal this to anyone, I'll do you like we did Nakamura.
Man, we lost the ballgame yesterday.
I have to save him.
I'm not one of them!
Kuro-chan . . .
She's falling even more and more in love!
I can feel the beer coming back up.
Oh yeah, I can't right now.
"Don't understand?" Maybe you just don't want to think that I do understand.
Izuka!
That's amazing, Kokonoe! I knew you can do it if you try hard enough.
Hold me till I get home.
Eh?
So, do you like me?
It's because you're the adorable student in our class.
Hey, can you help me with the shampoo?
He mustn't see it!
Don't look, virgin!
Stop it!
Hey, Kokonoe!
Because of my breasts, I'm too noticeable.
Here, pass these behind you.
Be sure to give this to your relative-
Jump!
Synchro!
You look like a dog!
Kokonoe!
Well, I wanna get big just like Mimi-chan.
Here we go!
Rin, that's very rude.
Ugh, you're mean.
I don't wanna!
All right, Kokonoe. I'll be seeing you tomorrow.
Hey Reiji, what do you think of Sensei?
You're concerned about me? Why?
Sitting height and chest . . . I'd pass on him.
We had those soft-serves, played that card game. . .
Kuro-chan, please lend me some cash!
Then, is it alright if we kiss?
Great idea, let's do it! There's a whole bunch of stuff guys will like as long as it's old fashioned.
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah! We should do it, we should totally do it!
Y . . . you really think I'm cute?
Really?
Is there some more?
I guess so.
In any case, the person Rin-chan's in love with is . . .
Mm-hmm. She's really pretty.
R-right. Uh . . .
It's almost summer vacation!
Even during summer vacation, I'll still be coming to school.
Yep!
R-right . . .
Aww, he was blushing the whole time. Yuck City.
What are you doing, Rin-chan?
I can see him . . . whenever.
Whenever . . . um . . . when we're finished here . . . the two of us could maybe . . . the festival is coming up . . .
You told me.
Look, it's getting dark, it's time for you to go home.
If I do that . . . you'll be watching the fireworks with Hoin-sensei.
Now getting home will be-
You could have borrowed the one from Hoin-sensei.
They're lacy and frilly and totally cute!
Sensei!
Wait up!
Kokonoe.
I guess you got mad after I said little girls shouldn't get too close.
Or rather, you got mad after I . . . saw what I just saw.
I was wrong.
I told her to go to bed just a little while ago.
I knew it, it's still too much for her.
Are you some geezer?
What the heck? Self-study periods are for studying what you want!
So you say, but have you ever really studied anything?
Aoki-sensei?
About that issue with our teaching methods, is it all right if we stay a little late?
Is that right?
It is because there is a problem with her we called you here in the first place.
While we were shopping, I came across these habanero chicken-flavored potato skins!
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.
What's this? Kokonoe?
Color me surprised!
Sensei. You . . . you know what?
Hey, Kokonoe!
Sensei! Don't get mad!
He came for me.
He came . . . for me.
It's simple.
Aki-san . . .
Kokonoe!
Reiji . . . is busy right now.
It's already nightfall and you're going to become extremely cold.
I do things like this, and you hate me and want to get away from me. I understand.
Stay with me by my side.
Why are you here at this hour?
No! Apologize to Aoki-sensei! If you don't, I'll-
Wh-what do you mean?
But still, I should be telling myself that it's good that Rin-chan got her mumps early.
But you stayed put all this time.
Oh right, I went to your school.
Why?! Where's my say?!
Rin . . .
Kokonoe!
I . . . just wanted to go back to school.
I understand.
I want to understand his situation too.
You have taught me a lot.
I think I'll get going.
I've decided I don't have to rush it!
Atashirashiku koudou BABY
Mou, mou?
When did you first get sick?
And because of her, the entire class was cheerful.
Atsuo!
Here.
How can I become happy?
Self-study time, kids!
Just forget it.
There's no point in asking Usa-san.
I guess it's impossible for her without Rin-chan.
Hey!
Okay.
For me... huh?
I want...
Nothing comes out of these!
But now...
Would you like to have some dinner?
That she was hiding a side of her seen by no one that is weak and helpless.
It was you that told Houin-sensei about my father, wasn't it?
Don't worry, I'll put everything in order.
Hey, don't wander into the road!
That's not safe.
And I had dinner all ready.
Someday, for sure...
I guess, I can also make someone else happy.
"Someday, for sure, you will meet someone who will understand you."
If you feel up to it...
Would you care to join me?
Rin-chan!
I'm mad at you! Because of you, I had to be lectured by Aoki!
an8And he wrinkled my dress...
I see.
Sensei!
It's fine! Don't wear yourself out.
You saying it doesn't make me happy at all!
Uhfscx200-r
They're so bright...
an7mitehoshikute rashiku itai kara

an7That's right, a girl is a special princess
an7Turn and come directly towards me.

Yeah, we're going on the cheap. Plus there's a lot less work involved.
Oh, coming!
Aida!
You'll wrinkle my dress!
Do the problems from page 86 to 89 in your textbooks.
Got it?
Kagami's in trouble now!
an8In case you have no clue what the moonrunes written on the test say, it's "Arithmetic - Division - Class 4-1 - Name - Usa Mimi - Do these calculations - Each worth five points" I thought the leechers who download borderline kiddie porn would be intelligent enough to at least have an idea what the test is - or at least not give two shits.
I guess it's impossible for her without Rin-chan.
What the hell, virgin!
Hmph!
Do you want to change?
Sorry to make you do this, but can you give these handouts to Kokonoe?
When she became a fourth-grader and the class rep, I thought everything was turning for the better.
Her cough has gotten better and she's a lot more stable.
Yeah.
If you want pudding or ice-cream or anything, just say so.
But now...
It couldn't be anyone other than you.
Only because I was the Board of Education chairman's daughter!
an8Here it is, the birth of the pairing.
an8I gotta say, those are some dangerous sidewalks.
Look, it's all right...
And I had dinner all ready.
an8Another fail editing thanks to Mimi
So... until then, don't give up.
I guess, I can also make someone else happy.
She gave me a love that was irreplaceable.
Um... it's me, Houin.
What are you doing calling this late?
No, it's fine, forget about it!
What the heck was that?
What's that?
If Kuro-chan finds out, she'll kill me!
I see.
It's for your sake... and mine.

I will never stop myself

I'm sorry Aoki-sensei!
Being alone makes me feel all desolate
I put myself on the line
I lose it then I have it
Thank you!
Oh, you mean "Everybody gets along?" Okay then.
Ohmygawd, you could hear his voice clear from Istanbul!
The kids are gaining so much skills and knowledge from those club activities!
If the kids are too occupied with clubs, they'll begin to neglect their regular classes, am I wrong?
If that is how you feel, how would you like to advise all the clubs?
"Snag?"
You should really get different glasses!
My name is Kagami Kuro
Shirai's now a "chan"?
No way! Tell me!
Who... who would?
Oh yeah!
You can have this!
You did too, you liar!
What's there to get?
I'm supposed to collect them and hand them over to Aoki-sensei.
Uh...
Oh, haw-haw.
What are you doing?!
Mama, Aoki, they just don't get it! They treat me like an idiot!
This kid... she's a girl.
When we hold hand, my heart races.
Huh?
I've heard that Fujimori-san's daughter, Chika-chan, is getting married!
A good morning to you!
I see everyone is looking well. That pleases me to the utmost.
Hey, hey! Listen!
What the heck?
You little... you little...!
Kuro-chan!
You little piece of...!
ED-English - new style
I will whisper my true feelings inside your ear.
I don't just love you - I really, really love you!
Oh well, if I must...
When I blurted out my unclear feelings
Since we're in fourth grade, this version will help us be a little more adult.
Now, nobody's saying that...
"Snag?"
"Flap?"
Ever since then, I thought you were totally awesome!
Shiro-chan!
Shiro-chan! Did you go number one or number two?
We really do think alike!
What?! As if! That girl is such a drag!
So what about Maki?
If you can buy less clothes...
Again for Aoki?
That's right.
Maybe if you'd give a girl a kiss, she might be willing to sign up.
What are you doing?!
I was thinking of making some banners with these.
an8Okay, the readable words are giving a choice whether to reserve or decline a space at this reunion. See, not that important.
Bookish glasses and a conservative dress.
Whaddaya mean no?! Ya moron!
Shiro-chan!
You little piece of...!
Emergency! Emergency!
Why won't it come to the Nichome district?
I'm flying right through the sky.
Feelings I will reach out and touch.

Aida Itsuo.
Next up, Kokonoe Rin.
Be-sides, you soo saw me naked!
Since he was all skin and bones, I've been leaving him some of my school lunch.
Actually, this cat likes sweet rolls better than regular bread.
"Die."
I've so just done the same things as Nakamura-sensei did.
Just . . . just because of that . . . you had to push him to the point of illness?
Today we're doing experiments! Airguns!
I have to save him.
7 X 4 is the same as 5 X 4 and 2 X 4 put together, so the answer here is 2.
That's amazing, Kokonoe! I knew you can do it if you try hard enough.
Kokonoe.
I thought you hated me.
You're not gonna to do that, are you?
Yes! Lovely!
It's a love letter!
Sending!
Rin-chan, you are being too rough.
I . . . I can't take it!
Psyche!
Mimi-chan.
I sold that bra to a recycling shop.
Kuro-chan, when you said "recycling shop," didja mean . . .
Kokonoe!
Sensei, you pervert!
You all have an assignment due.
You look like a dog!
Serves you right.
Kuro-chan, please lend me some cash!
Pretty please? I'll do anything you want, just name it!
Then, is it alright if we kiss?
Yup!
Ow!
The cooler at the office suddenly broke down. I thought I'd just bring my work home with me today.
So, they call you Mimi-chan? You look cute with those glasses.
Sorry! I'll wipe it off.
I'm really sorry.
The waves . . . they're real!
Below?
We'll see him running over here in a little bit.
Even during summer vacation, I'll still be coming to school.
Hoho, very good!
Do . . . does it look weird?
R-right . . .
Hey, you there! No running!
Kokonoe . . . you . . .
I don't have to go home.
Were you wonely wifout Win awound?
Actually, it seems like we've been seeing each other a whole bunch of times this summer vacation-
Just playing with ya!
Hey, that's dangerous!
I was wrong.
Kokonoe.
About that issue with our teaching methods, is it all right if we stay a little late?
Kokonoe!
You don't believe us?
I'm afraid you people don't inspire much confidence that you are able to care of her.
While we were shopping, I came across these habanero chicken-flavored potato skins!
Oh, I forgot the avocado dip!
Incorrect!
Kuro-chan, it's too tight!
Oh, Rin-chan! You're back!
Are you . . . mad?
He came for me.
I myself . . . must be kind?
Huh?
If you hate, you'll only suffer needlessly.
Virgin!
You're blushing!
Don't be stupid, just help me!
Okay.
Hey now, Kokonoe-!
I must . . . protect . . . Rin.
I got you something.
Wh-what do you mean?
Rin?
This is . . .
I understand.
But, I do really want to understand, I don't want to give up.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Uh-huh.
Anata nara sokko WEDDING
Mou, mou?
be1K-K-Kokonoe!
be1Her whole body has started to fill out.
be1I'm sorry, we were much too noisy.
be1So long...former young lady.
be1She's always cheerful, always smiling. I wonder why...
be1I did it! I got the Seashell Maiden Card!
be1I wonder why...
be1I definitely think something like a necktie would be good.
be1Please, if you do I'll listen to anything you say!
be1Uhuh, but gently, ok?
be1Ouch!
be1"Reiji"?
be1The air conditioner at the office broke, so today I thought I would come home and finish my work.
be1No...
be1Well I don't agree. Look, you have such delicate hands.
be1Thank you!
be1I'll clean up in here, in the meantime why don't you all take a bath?
be1I'm really sorry. Forgive me...
be1What did you say?!
be1She's so kind... Rin-chan.
be1So strong, cheerful, and graceful.
be1Is there any shampoo?
be1Perfect!
be1It's a little small isn't it?
be1They're really good friends aren't they?
be1Uwah, that's really thick...
be1I see... Since she doesn't have any parents, the reason why Rin is so energetic...
be1Wait! What about saying good night?
She's absent!
You there! No taking pictures!
Is she in the hospital? Or-
Don't run him off.
Alright. Look at the example carefully.
Here.
But...
Sensei, pai pai.
an8Translator's Note: "Pai Pai" is a childish word for breast.
Um...! Can I have a bit of your time?
I've already talked to the principal.
They really are annoying, impudent, and adult-like.
Die.
For sure.
Nice to meet you.
I heard that you're very smart.
"No."
"No, not with these words."
Eh?
Adults didn't understand her, whether they were teachers or parents.
What is ?
Is it ok for me to look?
Yeah, I...
Usa and Nyah aren't the only ones,
Sensei!
be1Today's society is depressing and the politicians are useless.
be1I tease him because I love him.
be1Sensei!
be1I mean...
be1How do I make them enjoy my lessons?
be1I don't understand it at all.
be1I want to see all the animals live in peace and smile around the world.
be1You always get a high score...
be1Ah, I can't. Aoki-sensei said he has a private lesson for me.
be1Oh, really?
be1If only Rin-chan was a boy...
be1Therefore, this answer will be 28.
be1We can't make any progress unless you understand this.
be1Don't understand? You just want to think that I don't understand.
be1Then, give me some other type of reward.
be1Sensei is miserable now that you said that.
be1Sensei is trying hard.
be1Oh, thank you.
be1First of all, the school.
be1I associate textbooks with school.
be1Aoki-sensei!
be1Ah... I appreciate your hard work.
be1See you tomorrow!
be1What are you doing? It'll be 7 o'clock soon.
be1Hold me until we get to my house.
be1Sure...
be1Yes.
be1Of course...
be1You seem to be in a good mood.
be1U-Um, what do you-
be1If you don't put something on, you-
be1Usa's breast... Are third graders that developed?
be1Oh no! You're completely soaked!
be1Sensei, are you okay!?
be1That one is troublesome in and of itself.
be1"D-Don't matter?"
be1Oh, okay.
be1"Females that don't matter."
be1Yep.
be1No, wait, how are you going to...
be1How can I be like Sensei... and have big breasts?
be1Don't want your breasts to grow?
be1Limbo dance.
be1Rin.
be1Mimi-chan, let me borrow that bra for a bit.
be1Give us some measuring tape.
be1Rin-chan, that tickles...
be1He's just my co-worker. Just act more... more natural.
be1To-To-To-... Today, today, let's go drinking today!
be1But in exchange...
be1Kokonoe.
be1A pruny finger that's been in the water too long.
be1I can do a handstand now, want to see it?
be1Yeah, I'm going to visit my father.
be1you're sure to make new discoveries.
be1What? You still haven't decided?
be1I have a system for giving out balanced grades, so it's pretty easy for me.
be1But scores aren't everything!
be1But he is able to clearly convey his points.
be1It's our duty.
be1Oh?
be1Kokonoe.
be1Yes.
be1Ok!
be1Don't be so obvious about it!
be1Don't stay up too late.
be1I have to go back to work.
be1I need to find a way to let you relax a bit.
be1Kokonoe.
be1Sensei's the only one wearing a bikini. That's really low.
be1And you have to massage under the armpits.
be1Like this?
be1Yes?
be1Ah, don't mess with other people's panties.
be1When wearing a skirt, you should wear bloomers underneath.
be1Oh, Kuro-chan.
be1What are we supposed to do now, wet like this?
be1That's not the problem.
Hey, I wonder what the new teacher is gonna be like!
All the unfair stuff that adults keep doing?
That's for me . . .
Do you have a girlfriend?
Heh...
Cruel stuff?
Blood? I'll stop it for you.
Hey, you there, no running!
Kagami, let me see that.
Eh?
Oh...
What are you doing, Sensei?
Sensei, bye-bye!
He said that if this were to get out, It will just cause an uproar among the students.
I'm not sure what to do.
"Die."
Ko-Kokonoe!
"Why didja stop coming to school?" he said.
Sensei, what do you think will happen?
I was getting tired of waiting.
Not really.
I won't be doing it anymore.
So what about it? Will you be coming back to school?
They said your old teacher said some pretty terrible things to you.
Morning.
Today we're doing experiments! Airguns!
V-Virgin?
Don't look down!
I have to save him.
Come here, Nyaa. It's all right.
Aoki-sensei!
Rin-chan, you shouldn't move him.
Nothing to get worried about, thank goodness.
"It will be all right with Aoki-sensei."
Houin-sensei says to hurry back to class.
Oh yeah! Do you want to have dinner on the way back? It will be my treat.
That was probably too hot for the virgin to handle.
ED
Getchu!
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go
So I'll just kiss you warmly.
A girl's punch will get through for real, doncha think?
Kiss! I've been tied by the rules and in a fix! I cried my eyes out
be1You have a distant cousin, Aki-chan. You should visit her in Tokyo.
be1It's a great place!
be1The best one!
be1It's the best.
be1She isn't usually so affectionate!
be1Really... cool!
be1I'm leaving!
be1It's stage two cancer.
be1I got a bonus!
be1A bonus?
be1It's okay, it's okay!
be1Hm?
be1I'll protect you as well, Aki-san, not just Rin!
be1Rin!
be1Rin, don't be troublesome.
be1I want to go back home.
be1Aki-san...
be1Somehow...
I'm looking forward to it!

Yeah, yeah, really suddenly, too!
From now on, I'll be the homeroom teacher of class 3-1.

She's not here!
Oh?
Wai-
Rin will be sensei's girlfriend from now on!
HAAA!?
Argh!
What are you doing, Aoki-sensei?
Oh?
Oh...
She stopped coming.
Hmmm, it has to do with Nakumura-sensei leaving, too...
Oh...
During class, he would suddenly snap or cry.
He scratched me!
Kagami, lend it to me for a moment.
Ah-
Sensei, pai pai!
Good job, Houin-sensei.
But...
The things he said to Mimi-chan.
It's your damned fault!
Well, if possible, can I be alone with her?
What do you think?
I heard from Kokonoe and Kagami...
What's a finger fellatio?
Mhm
Of course...
Rin-chaaan!!!
I'll get a ladder!
I have to save it...
Kokonoe...
I'll call for a teacher!

Ha!
That would be a good point if schools didn't already do something about it.
Wouldn't you want to know the children's situation at home-
There's not much you can do against.
If that's the case, why don't you take a look at the the old class-registers?

Show me some make-up that will make me look like a boy.

It doesn't seem, you have been hugged a lot.
Wait a moment!
No matter how you look at it, you look like a boy.

fnComic Sans MSfs34Something more important than being touched for a girl is, to become honest...
fnComic Sans MSfs34It'll happen,
Don't...
Kuro-chan, you are so perverted!
That's not good!
What are you doing outsi-
Eh?
Oh!
Argh!
Even it's personal study, there's no change in class!
About the work discussion...
What's up?
Aren't you hungry?
Ko-
Hey!
I hate you!
Ko-
You can't believe it?
Shirai-sensei...
Today, I will be substituting for him.
Since she said that.
Rin-chan, waiiiit!
HA!
You also came unexpectedly!
Hu?
Recyclable garbage!
Those are my friends from-
T- Th- Thank you.
A teacher who's close to their students.
If one wants to look forward, they can't let their legs wobble.
He must take things seriously!
Rin-chan, stay and look after Aoki-sensei please.
What's up with her?
That's fine for me.
Oh?
That's, ehm...
I was the one who brought that!
Oh!
It's like chinese porridge!
Right? It's really good for you.
Sorry, Houin-sensei...
"Children"...
Since you're so unreliable, the students are underestimating you.
Everyone left...
fnComic Sans MSfs34I wonder if you saw C flying after being beaten?
I want to clean each one of them and see you happy...
Rin-chan!
Yep, looks like.
OP
Live by what you preach.

Be-sides, you soo saw me naked!
But it's a video.
There wasn't much you can do. The kids from Class One are pretty rowdy.
Usa Mimi, huh?
Nyaa?
Since he was all skin and bones, I've been leaving him some of my school lunch.
Heh . . .
They say we should care for animals, but then they go off and kill them.
Afternoon classes just started!
This is the class text that Nakamura-sensei used.
I went to the principal about this, but he told me to keep quiet about it.
Eh?
Sensei, what do you think will happen?
Mimi-chan wasn't the only one victimized by Nakamura.
But you fellated his finger and gave him a free striptease. That's some servicing you're doing.
That's why I kind of wanted to meet you, Aoki-sensei.
You were pretty weak out there.
A sweet roll?
But . . . on the other hand, if I do have to pass judgement, I would . . .
Virgin!
Kokonoe, don't move!
Sensei!!
They said he was only knocked out.
Uh . . . do we have to do it too?
Hey, come on!
I'm not feeling any better about this.
Kokonoe!
Sorry to keep you waiting!
That's dangerous, forceful - GO! IN!
LUCKY I gobbled down your earlobe.

Look at Kuro-chan!
Are you going to the teacher's lounge?
How a parent treats a child...
See you!
Hey! Wait for me!
Sensei!
Everyone switched clothes!
Sensei
Hey!
Ohhh!
Reiji-san!?
Oh!
I'll be returning late, too...
I wonder what I should get...
I'm already full.
Hey, Rin-chan!
This is more effective!
Stingy!
Do you even know what you do on a date?
"You're just...
It's just a skirt decoration...
Why are you wearing this sexy lingerie?
Oh!
If it's for me, he'll come flying.
He may kill sensei!
Why do you avert your eyes?
You think that Rin...
That's all!
About Kokonoe?
Come on!
HU!?
I just wanted to drink a lot!
Eh?
And Kokonoe...
All the other students, too...
I always think: "Why can't you do it better?"
When I look at you, it irritates me...

Aoki-sensei is different from Nakamura-sensei...
Hm!
Argh!
HEY!
It's because...
It's because I worked hard!
Is it finished already?
Ha...
Good God...
Such a failure of a class.
If you kiss me, I'll help you out!

Oh!
Ah- Choo!
Hm?
OH!
I'll be leaving first.
At this rate...
I know it...

Oh, it's from Reiji.

Can you die because you're naked!?

You actually stayed here.
That's right!
O- Oh-
Rin...
Ah!
Listen to my voice!
Reiji...
I understand.
That I don't know anything.
I should go now.
Then, again...
I'm also...
You're an adult...
And...
Sensei, you suuuck!

Hey hey, I wonder what our new teacher is going to be like!
Who knew that the class before was physical education...
Everybody, please take good care of me.
Izuka Shinji.
Eh, um... I'm 23.
Sensei is a pervert!
She's been absent this entire month.
That was one of the reasons why the previous teacher, Nakamura, quit.
I don't do such things.
a6kotatsu  heated table
Her tongue is...
But I was told to keep quiet about it.
"Why didn't you come to school?" "Everything is your fault."
A-Anyway, I need to talk to your parents about this.
I will make sure you end up just like Nakamura.
You don't know where that finger has been.
...wasn't it?
A kind and gentle side that takes care of friends.
Good morning.
Nyaa?
But if I still needed to make a decision, I would...
Don't climb there!
I need to save him...
Sensei!
Eh? Really?
One, two...!
Was that...just him?
Damn... It wasn't like there was anything worth seeing.
I'm Daisuke Aoki.
Here!
Izuka Shinji.
Here!
Sensei is a pervert!
Be quiet!
Umm... Hin-sensei.
Being a new homeroom teacher isn't easy.
She quit school.
He was under a lot of pressure.
Actually, it likes to eat bread rolls more than plain bread.
Horrible things?
I don't do such things.
At home, there's an old cat that I feed.
It's bleeding.
Ah.
What's going on this time!?
Was this... really done by a student from my class?
But for them to do something like this...or But for them to do something of this degree...
You're late. I was getting tired of waiting for you.
Um... I'm the new homeroom teacher, Daisuke Aoki.
Kokonoe and Kagami told me,alphaHFF that the previous Sensei said horrible things to you.
I wonder who put it there?
Is it not here...?
Aoki-sensei.
Sensei!
Sorry to make you wait!
Should we investigate a little to find out?
Please take good care of us!
Here! Here! Here!
Eh, um... alphaHFFI'm 23.
The noise can be heard all the way on the next floor.
Thank you very much.
Is she in the hospital? Or-
He would continually take unexcused absences, and when he returned, we would hear complaints.
But...
Sensei, bye-bye.
Aoki-sensei.
B-But... even so...alphaHFF you didn't need to hound him until he got sick.
You never know what his finger could have touched before. Dirty, filthy, stinky.
Oh, I'm so sorry that you had to go out of your way to come here.
"No."
Kokonoe and Kagami told me,alphaHFF that the previous Sensei said horrible things to you.
Really?
These were texts Rin-chan and Kuro-chan sent me.
But...
They lost the game yesterday.
Yeah, I...
We are doing an experiment today! An experiment!
Let's not talk about the specifics.
Let's just try it first.
I think it would be unfair for someone like me, who wasn't there, to judge what has already happened.
He's so pitiful. He's been teased for so long...
Mimi-chan.
Thank you, Sensei.
Here's a present for saving me!
Hey, you three...!
Everybody! It's a pleasure... to... alphaHFFmeet...
Was that...just him?
I'm Daisuke Aoki.
What's this, they're acting respectfully.
Is that right?
Next is... Kokonoe Rin.
Here! Here! Here!
Eh, um... alphaHFFI'm 23.
Eh, wait, we're taking roll right now...
Sensei is a pervert!
Uhh... I want to ask about Usa Mimi.
She quit school.
Sometimes, during class, he would have emotional breakdowns and start crying.
Usa Mimi...
Don't run him off.
Alright. Look at the example carefully.
Here.
Just writing "Hope" isn't fun.
Aoki-sensei, I want you to face the students seriously.
This is hard to believe.
But for them to do something like this...or But for them to do something of this degree...
Eh?
Everyone appreciates Rin-chan.
Kuro-chan?
Rin-chan.
I will never let anyone hurt Mimi-chan ever again.
These were texts Rin-chan and Kuro-chan sent me.
But...
Going out?
Good morning, Mimi-chan.
Nyah?
Rin-chan!
Aoki-sensei! No Sensei, don't die!
No, Sensei, Sensei!
Oh, I see.
Eh?
Aoki-sensei seems to have something on his mind.
Sensei will definitely grow up well.
Just like a fatty.
be1I don't mean to joke around with him...I might love him.
be1and go back home at nearly midnight. I go to bed after coming back home without doing anything!
be1But, she's too cheeky, always causing problems, and moreover she's erotic.
be1A delicious meal filled with energy and vitality. At night, I want to wash sensei!
be1I want to see all the animals live in peace and smile around the world.
be1You must be very tired, Aoki-sensei.
be1I'm ok.
be1So he can gain more experience, we should just watch.
be1What happened, Rin-chan?
be1I admit I have a little problem, but I've done it my way...
be1Don't you say you've "done it your way."
be1Oh, really?
be1You're not going to be rewarded even if you fall in love with a teacher!
be1Yes, yes, my princess, I'll play with you tomorrow.
be1Let's go! Mimi-chan!
be1S-Shut up!
be1We can't make any progress unless you understand this.
be1Then, give me some other type of reward.
be1A lesson that has appeal...
be1It means... first of all, I prepare 8 boxes and...
be1Eh... I'll start then.
be1I heard the results of the exam.
be1We couldn't go eat dinner last time.
be1That sounds good.
be1I'll give you a reward except, that.
be1Why?
be1I love you, Kokonoe.
be1I don't feel like doing this, right, Rin-chan?
be1It's so soft here!
be1I... I love you, Rin-chan but... I don't tease you.
be1I'm teased by my students, and I have to prepare lessons for the next day. I wake up at 6 A.M. every morning,
be1Don't give up.
be1Let's see. "My dream. I don't have any particular dream."
be1They had no intention to write from the beginning.
be1You must be very tired, Aoki-sensei.
be1It's ok, I'll go get a towel.
be1What happened, Rin-chan?
be1Your class doesn't have appeal, that's why they don't follow your lecture seriously.
be1Let's go! Mimi-chan!
be1What?
be1Sensei is miserable now that you said that.
be1Sensei is trying hard.
be1Hey, lunch break is over.
be1Open to page 18.
be1Today I'm teaching an easier way to memorize it.
be1Yes!
be1Sensei...!
be1You did well!
be1Because you, helped me...
be1Yes.
be1Even if I made the ex-teacher leave the school?
be1I love you...
be1No, a teacher.
be1Are these breasts just for decoration?
be1Thank you.
be1This is the road that a mid-level grade school teacher walks; it's a hard road.
be1Usa's breast... Are third graders that developed?
be1"Breasts that don't matter."
be1I don't think it's good to waste food.
be1I was worried that it might have fallen off and came to check on it.
be1Sweet things help you relieve stress.
be1No, wait, how are you going to...
be1Anyway, I would never take interest in a guy like that...
be1Don't worry, as long as you keep drinking plenty of milk, yours will get big soon.
be1Also, having big ones isn't always that good.
be1Isn't it about time you wear a bra?
be1Mimi-chan.
be1Oh ya, Kagami was reading this.
be1Rin.
be1Rin. Rin. Rin. Rin.
be1Mommy...
be1Not really.
be1Where did you buy this?
be1Amazing, Kuro-chan, you sure are smart.
be1Yes.
be1What? Mimi-chan?
be1No, that's too different from my personality.
be1Eh?
be1He bites me often.
be1He might be acting this way because his teeth are itchy.
be1It'll be my first time to drink with Oyajima-sensei.
be1Then, why don't you ask me to put on one too?
be1You're suppose to get it after you help her. You haven't...
be1You saw it for free again!
be1Rin-chan's school swimsuit. Rin-chan's wet hair.

You know this guy lost his cherry back in six grade!
I can feel the beer coming back up.
Rin-chan, time to go!
Yes, yes, my princess. I promise to play with you next time.
Why's that? If Rin-chan were a boy, we'd be going to different bathrooms.
I won't understand if you don't talk straight.
Turn right at this corner.
Even if I don't get good grades on tests?
Even if I eat it?
But still, you are a good girl.
So, do you like me?
Someone told me they loved me in school today.
Huh?!

be1And now, here is your homework!
be1Ah! Good morning!
be1I've done my homework!
be1I did it!
be1T-That's not true.
be1You too, Kokonoe.
be1You've done a great job writing about your guardian.
be1Well, I might have known a little about it, but...
be1Wa-
be1Goodbye, everyone.
be1Rin-chan!
be1Nice house...
be1At the time I was still a minor,
be1Rin and I, just the two of us.
be1Ah! Why is he here?
be1N-No, there isn't!
be1Come on, face your teacher properly.
be1Say, Reiji!
be1Well, let's go eat!
be1Is it bad for a teacher to worry about his students?
be1Mimi-chan, will you be going anywhere for summer break?
be1But if I do that, the outstanding students wouldn't be recognized.
be1Kokonoe.
be1Sure.
be1Even if you don't like the subject, you should still pay attention.
be1Sensei, goodbye.
be1Rin-chan, let's hurry up and leave.
be1It feels so strange...
be1To think that starting tomorrow, there won't be any students in this classroom.
be1I have to go back to work.
be1Compared to the cuter swimsuits I have,
be1this school swimsuit is just too modest.
be1Um, I was planning on wearing a one-piece originally, but there wasn't one in my size.
be1We're wearing school swimsuits.
be1Sensei's the only one wearing a bikini. That's really low.
be1Ok...
be1That's right.
be1Um, did you know?
be1I think we should go patrol it.
be1Let's just go!
be1The fireworks will start soon...
be1Kokonoe!
be1Why are you always causing trouble for others?
be1Kokonoe, you...
be1Let's go back home...
be1It's very pretty, Kuro-chan.
be1It's so boring without Rin-chan.
be1I won't if you don't hold me.
be1In order to keep you from cheating, I'm going to keep an eye on you over summer break.
be1I'm okay with this.
be1You don't have anyone left here, do you?
be1Also...
be1Itakimasu!
be1Why didn't you get married, even though you gave birth to a child?
be1What kind of magic did you use?
be1Ehh?
be1I'll be late today too,
be1No, no, I'm sorry for suggesting it.
be1Okay.
be1Really... cool!
be1No. I'm going to the doctor after work.
be1Do you have a husband or any relatives?
be1It's stage two cancer.
be1A bonus?
be1There's no more open space...
be1Rin?
be1You're not feeling well, let's stop.
be1You'll recover soon.
be1I've asked the doctors to calculate the costs...
be1Rin, if you run, be careful.
be1Rin!
be1Will mom die?
be1Beautiful!
be1Mmmm, Delicious!
be1A charm that will make you a millionaire, a charm that will grant you love.
be1It may be good to try some of these one day.
be1Ah, that's right! The present!
be1Foot size too?
be1Still, brats should only have to wear clothes made for children.
be1Eh?
be1Miss?
be1Eh? Ah? Well, it's okay. I just---
be1Ahh, isn't that good enough? Let's hurry up and decide then go play!
be1Why do you think that?
be1I'm really sorry. Forgive me...
be1What did you say?!
be1Huh? Reiji...we're out of shampoo.
be1Mimi-chan look.
be1The wave is real...
be1I see... Since she doesn't have any parents, the reason why Rin is so energetic...
be1...is because she has Reiji.

Damn, didja even suspect?

Oh yeah! First, today's essays.
You look beat, Aoki-sensei.
Ah, I'm all right. I'll get a washtowel.
Rin-chan, time to go!
Is that right?
If we played together, we'd be made fun of.
Sure, I can do that.
We're done for today. You may go home.
Uh . . . yeah, I should.
That would mean if you make 8 boxes for 8 people, how many marbles would go in-
Oh! It's an ammonite, isn't it?
Cool, ain't it? I got some more at home.
Oh, Kagami? What is it?
Heh, and he had no clue.
Speaking of which, we have the textbook.
Sensei!
Sensei! Mimi-chan's angry!
I've heard. The test results showed you did great!
Sensei.
All right then . . .
"Why's that?"
I thought you hated me.
"Of course" meaning . . .?
It's because you're the adorable student in our class.
Eh . . . huh?!
You seem pretty pleased, Rin.

Why's she in a sour mood?
Here. I'll give you this if it'll make you feel better.
Come on... take a sip.

Get real! I'd look like some bimbo if I start enticing him with my breasts!
Oh, Usa. What is it?
Isn't it about time you wore a bra?
Rin-chan...
Reiji!
Hey, check that out!
Wow, Kuro-chan, you're so smart!
You're so lucky, I wanna have this much!
St-Stoppit!
"I won't let you get away tonight!"
Huh...
Ooh, that sounds great!
This would be the first time I had a drink with you, Oyajima-sensei, right?
I'll deal with Mimi-chan's sitch for you somehow.
You'll do that?
Hug me.
Hug!

All the unfair stuff that adults keep doing?
Live by what you preach.
I can smell the lie from here.
If you spoil me, I'll just take advantage of it.
If you truly care for me, it will surely lead to
I'm going to give it to Aoki-sensei.
When they become third-graders, they'll enter into that stage that'll surprise no one.

You can't see it!
Oh no! You're completely soaked!
Breasts that don't matter . . .
They don't matter . . . they don't matter . . .
Sheeze, Kuro-chan you went too far!
There's still some left, right?
right now tastes the same as my lips.
You don't want your breasts to be big?
No one in our class is wearing a bra yet!
If I hunch over wherever I go, and wear patterned shirts, no one will notice.

I'll frickin' crush him!
There you go!
Mimi-chan, could you lend me that bra for a sec?

You can think of me that way if you'd like.
The brain has wrapped around it and it's a part of her body now.
The reason Harriet and the EX-1 can communicate...
It might be possible.
See you in 12 hours then.
No, not yet...
She left her ID card behind.
We'll just sit around and drink tea?
Yes, ma'am!
Why don't you go take a nap?
Great.
Do you think she's only considered a tool to control the EX-1?
Why?
You kill Maki just like that...
Take over a while, would you?
Continue the search in D-Block.

No!
What about Mr. Fairy?

Suddenly, he's an expert.
But it'll heal?
Right?
Who was it...
What a weirdo.
It's possible.
Let's get the leg next.
Roger.
So will this really be our holy sword, our Excalibur?
It looks more like some torture device than Excalibur.
We should have all the data analyzed in 40 minutes.
Will this really work?
but if we focus on structure, we can find some answers.
And I've used a non-linear equation
That area...
How are you always so calm in the face of danger?
I'm not ready to die.
Then the solution is simple.
Into the EMP area?
Keep it straight!
Next one.

Mission accomplished.

Thank you.

See you later, Mr. Fairy!
I wouldn't have thought it...
...have kicked in again.
We received those this morning.
We don't know who to plug.
If the EX-1 goes out of control even for the slightest amount of time,
or if there is even a 1 percent probability of it causing harm to civilians,
Am I free to conclude that?
Enough stupid questions.
I retire in two years.
...some nuts with strange ideas about aliens.
The EX-1 has broken out of jail.
We'll catch the EX-1!
If only I stopped Maki, that wouldn't have happened...
Come get me!
I...
The worst.
You're the absolute worst.
Contemptible, if it weren't so amusing.

We have rough stats on the target.
Its mass appears to be about 1000 times that of normal aliens'.
All missiles confirmed hits.
That's pretty close.
Nothing sighted in the crater.
It's a slaughter.
Commander!
We don't know its intention, but we have to stop it.
Current distance 3000.
Lt. Soma?
That attack...

Lieutenant!
The aliens or the humans?
It doesn't matter.
I can't even kill that monster I live to hate.

It's no use.
Come on, Mr. Fairy!
No other choice.

I hate this!
Will we really just abandon this place?
No, we still have one left.
I never want to lose a unit I ought to bring back again.
That means nothing.
It's a pretty flimsy home to cling to.
We have to defend our home.
All fliers and particle bombers but damaged ones should be in the sky.
Acknowledged.
A woman's duty to look after her home is an old tradition, isn't it?
The target is within visual range.
No change in target and point of impact.
All that power?
It's all right, Hattie.
Everyone all right?
Yes, ma'am, we're okay.
We'd only get one shot at 60 efficiency.
It's already at the center of the base.
This is our last chance with the Fefnir!
Move!
Why?

Here I come!
Ryu, what are you doing?
No, don't worry...
blur2kaze wa yasashiku nosate yuku
We should have anticipated that.
...there's at least a 78 chance our tactics would have finished it.
I don't think it was a problem with our overall interception.
Speaking of that...
You said you will take responsibility,
Could you wrap it up, please.
Then let me just quickly give an overview.
concerning invasion and the aliens' goals.
It's too early to conclude that.
...and that this was not part of any master plan?
When performing a scientific analysis,
Also, we need to explain the event...
What we have to figure out
Is that correct?
it's obvious they have a reason!
I haven't had much experience,
but the idea is that it's impossible to pinpoint a single location
Even with the highest caliber telescope,
all we can get is a rough idea of the planets themselves.
So we have to conclude that the aliens, until they reached Earth,
is to first amass intelligence and then move to an outpost to...
Are you saying we've made the whole thing up?
The extra funds this new defense package would mean...
...don't have any idea how to solve this problem,
This isn't the place for partisan bickering.
Commander Ines!

What if we don't interfere with alien movement...
Yes, of course.
However, though we've employed a number of different models...
Well, as seen on page 3382 of the report,
...you're saying there's no connection between the point and the aliens?
So what are you trying to say, man?
We tracked down the family record and found a descendant...
Stop trying to force your conclusion.
...all the damage we've done trying to stop them has been for nothing.
If we hadn't seen civilian casualties or damage to the cities,
...are not so completely different from humans'.

Hayama, I'll go get Suzuki-sensei!
What are you saying?
Because that's what's best for me.
Because it's not informative and it won't make sense. You will make trouble!
Sana didn't come back yet?
You are really...
I'm sorry...
When you apologize from the heart then you look at the person.
Did Sensei read it too?
Sensei, what about Nakao-kun?
Sengoku-sensei...
Hayama-kun is so great...
And so he always carries all the weight and gets more enclosed.
When something little happens, then I run away quickly.
I don't understand.
But if you live, I have a feeling that I could win against the odds.
Don't confuse me.
I must run the errand, we might get stuck in traffic.
I won't say that anymore so...
I won't say that again!
Yeah, and he was with Kurata.
What does that mean?
Sana and Akito are not back yet.
Hayama, what's with the blood?
and if we keep it, we will become mummies.
I can't.
How is it? The police have no clues.
Matsui, Sugita!
Sana-chan disappeared, what is all this about?!
Chalkboard erasers...?
Sana...

We're here!
- How is Sana? - There were no heavy injuries...
You should watch my daughter.
Mama.
I don't know the circumstances but I guess it's true.
Akito...
It's not your fault, Sensei.
But now the school must decide on his expelling.
I see.
If you weren't there, maybe I would have...
Akito, do you want to change schools?
The doctor said that you could come home, what are you going to do?
I want to stay here until Nakao-kun regains his consciousness.
Sagami-kun, go tell those two the news.
Sengoku-sensei's not here either.
The teachers will come back soon.
Ah, Nakao kun is back to normal?
Saying we have 40 cubic meters left in our lives.
What happened?!
You guys didn't come back last night so...
I wonder what's gonna happen next.
I was thinking of the Karate Club and going to the same high school as Hayama.
At this rate...
We do not know that this incident is directly involving Hayama,
What is the need to research?!
When you questioned if I was in your class I thought that I was not a living being.
What else do I have, Sensei?
Why didn't you get rid of this letter, Sensei?
Principal!
Nakao-kun asking for help... It seems that you missed it, Sengoku-sensei.
we're trying to change in our own childish ways.
So get yourself together, adult!
Yeah?
They said that they're going to demolish this North Wing this year.

Then she made me sit down and eat breakfast!
It's true.
Okay, okay, perhaps I should explain some things here.
which has put you in a bad mood,
--our stomachs feel better!
and it's all because of one guy!
So, Suji-san, is this how my hair is going to be when I go on today?
Aah! You're after him!
So how about this new toim? Are you having a "happy new school yea-uh?"
I shua wish I could be re-bawn as a kid again.
could never hope to survive in!
You, Hayama! I mean you!
That was a load off! Right now, I feel like you do
You're two minutes faster than yesterday. Nice job.
Are you sure you're okay by yourself? Should I walk you to your classroom?
"Burutcha," The walkie-talkie that shakes.
Oh? So, this is my hotline to you, Rei-kun?
Sana-chan, you should stay home.
If you guys were to see yourselves in the mirror right now,
You guys make monkeys look smart!
What?!
What she means to say is "asses that borrow the lion's skin."
Eeee! Whassat!?
Sana-chan's popularity would soar!
What was he thinking?
Toys.
Ha! This is fun!

I'm Kurata Sana, age 11. I'm a sixth grader,
who's also in Gekidan Komawari, and active as an entertainer.
He's like the devil!
Cut it out, Hayama-kun!
What are you talking about!? You're the guys that suck up to Hayama so much!
It was just too big a hassle, or I would have done it sooner.
thank goodness. I thought you might start hitting Sana-chan.
"We'll do it after school."
Akito-kun is saying that you're too much for him, Sana-chan.
That's right!
You said some interesting things earlier, huh?
How could you do that!?
--Sana-chan!
I'm not scared by your threats! Just you watch!
in a two-hour drama? That's fabulous!
Congratulations! Good luck!
Thanks.
I'm a girl, and I can't beat him by force.

--Once something does happen... Sensei? --What should I do, Sri Lanka?
Goodness, it says that I have the personality of an angel.
In order to turn the fight to your favor,
 Hayama's weak spot, funya-funya, henyara-honyara 
 You got it, Sana-chan! You can beat him, Sana-chan! 
Hayama-san coming through! Make way!
Just a toy one, though.
Leeks! Onions! Green peppers! Carrots! Celery!
You'll feel better if you spit it out.
B- but, that's not something I could...
--Stop it! --Akito-kun, make them stop, okay?
This is the punishment you get for going against Hayama-san.
Eh? Clouds?
She's still home from school over the shock she received in the pond.
What's with you, Tsuyoshi-kun? You've had some nerve, for a while now.
Hmm, I guess you couldn't help it if you had school.
That rotten Hayama...!
I may be tardy getting to school, but I've never been late getting to work.
Sana-chan... l, um... I...
What? What? What? "What!?" "What!?" Hm? What?
Although I've said nothing bu! wisecracks...
And our usual classroom...

He's like the devil!
The truth is...
Eh!? Fear of heights!?
--All right, see you later... --doesn't he?
Today's the day!
Today's the day, you just watch, Hayama!
We're getting nowhere the way things are.
I wonder if Sana-chan is all right.
You can't escape now, Hayama Akito-kun!
Like the way we planned! Like the way we planned!
Sana-chan, I'm supposed to pull on this, right?
as you can be assuredly see by the included "Person's weight mannequin."
Also, there will be this high-sensitivity mike,
This is stupid. You think I would do something like this?
Make sure you good boys and girls don't go trying this.
We'll see your face in tears very soon now.
Hayama-san!
He's nervous! He's nervous!
What happened to all that confidence you had before you jumped?
That was the flaw in my strategy.
"It's the worst of schools"
That's odd. Did I get it wrong?
--Make-out! Make-out! Mambo! Make-out! --You don't have to dance, just listen to me.
Right, okay! Sana-chan, that was great!
What's up, Sana-chan? That was amazingly compelling!
you're going to go public with that picture.
An eye for an eyeball, and a tooth for a toothball!
This is my smoking pipe.
Tsuyoshi-kun, don't worry, I won't let him lay a hand on you.
Now then, how shall we lure him out, Washington-kun?
Sana-chan, listen, should we give up? Let's give up.
No dawdling around! You'll never become a great detective like that!
Hayama Akito! You're finished now!
Whoa! If you get angry at Tsuyoshi-kun,
S- Sana-chan! I'm off!
Come on, come on! Can you keep up with this step I learned in Gekidan Komawari?

What are we doing today?

Hayama! Come here a second.
Damn...
Geez, I'm so sorry.
Hmph! It serves him right!
The hearts of us girls hurt even more! They're all prickly, like on Cutey Honey!
O- okay, Gomi-kun, begin reading from page 26.
"Over the mountains, far to travel, people say, Happiness dwells."
We need to hurry and get back the parts where we're falling behind, right Sensei?

Why don't you give it up. Aren't you getting tired of it?
Hold on! Hold on! Why is it turning out like this!? Stop!
Here goes!
You're no challenge at all!
Listen, starting today, I'm the boss. Got that?
You're the one who said just one punch would be okay, weren't you!?
No, I don't. What's wrong?
You should just leave that guy alone!
Sana-chan, watch out!

That voice... Hayama's sister?
Ah, I don't know if I can...
Please? I'm a fan!
I can't stand looking at you!
You've grown up just the way I idealized.
"Oink."
W- what's going on? Tsuyoshi-kun is scaring me!
Right, right! Don't get discouraged!
Thanks, everyone.
There must be something going on inside that house.
"Back against the wall."
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Under the circumstances, everything up to now gets flushed down the toilet,
I may he a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ha-ha-ha-ha-hang!
Mama. She's an Aoki Laureate novelist who keeps a chipmunk on her head.
Hayama didn't have a mother in his household, did he?
"Morning with Hayama and Tsuyoshi-kun"
Wait! Wait! Wait! Chime, don't stop ringing yet!
It's too soon to tell.
"Let's all go see!"
Yeah! Let's go see!
I've already seen enough of your ugly faces, after all.
So that's how it is, huh!?
you weren't able to suddenly stop before, haven't you?
Hey, Hayama! Bring those grumpies over here!
Hey, you guys!
make it somebody who can actually play soccer.
Besides, this is about a different matter.
You've got something that's troubling you, right?
I'll return that sentiment right back at you.
You know? I want us all to be more cheerful and agreeable with each other!
Uh, no... I don't care anymore. If you want to die, you can just do it yourself.
Go ahead and smash your head in with the edge of a block of tofu or something!
It's no use for us to try talking about it, is it?
A little.
That's absolutely positively strange.
--Good morning. --Morning.
Good, it looks like you've cheered up.
There's nothing really going on between me and Hayama, so don't worry.
You'd better sit down for this! Ta-da!
American breakfast! Corn flakes!
I've got nothing to do with you!
That was a close one...
W- what is it with him!? I can't shake it off. It feels disgusting!
I get more and more nervous about being in it.
Mm-hmm. All right, it's been bugging me so much thinking about this,
Oh, I guess it doesn't do any good to show you the back of it.
I can't even study for my entrance exams.
Oh dear, Sana-chan, you're here?
Hayama...
For eleven whole years?
I'll do my best in this drama!
 I can't take my glas-sun off outside. 
 But even so, Rei-kun remains undaunted. 
I'm going to do my best in this drama.
You'll be saying "Being alive is so much fun, I can't stand it!"
Rei-kun, this is going to go over well for sure!
I know.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...panic!!

So you do your best, too! See ya!
Akito-kun's mother had always had a weak constitution,
I think it was because she called him the devil.
--Being called "devil," "devil" at home over and over for all this time, --Sana-chan... S- Sana-chan...
--it's no wonder why Hayama would be so perverse, is it!? --Hold on... Sana-chan...
--What a stupid father and daughter they are! --Sana-chan...
I'm going to do my best in this drama!
All right, I feel great!
Good morning! I'm Kurata Sana!
What are you tawlking about?
--"Welcome." It's right here in the script. --be sure to watch the broadcast!
U- um... K- Kurata Sana. It's nice to-- to have the occasion to meet you.
Sana-chan, good morning!
I really can't think of her as being anything else. I can't help it, can I?
Mika, did you know that the reason Mom's health got ruined
And ever since then, I've done nothing but work hard, taking care of you.
Right...
You demon child! I wish you had never been born!
For some reason, Rei-kun has been acting suspiciously for the last little while.
You're probably wondering what's going on, right?
My favorite food is freshly-made corn flake paste.
Hold it!
If I was in a family where I was raised, being called "devil, devil,"
I'd probably turn into a real devil myself!
For some reason, Rei-kun is beyond my comprehension today.
So how about it? Oh, here it comes, here it comes...
What's this, now?
If you like, I can call him on my Burutcha.
I'll do my best in this drama! So you do your best, too!
Mm-hmm! This drama is just like what's going on at Hayama's house.
It'll be contagious! Absolutely!
Good afternoon. Rather, good evening, I suppose.
Is Hayama-- I mean, Akito-kun here?
Uh-huh.
He torments the teachers, and bullies others, and stuff.
Hayama! Come on, where are you!?
I love you, A-chan, and that's why I tried so hard to have you.
Whoa, did you catch a cold!? No wonder you've been playing along so easily!
I'm in complete control of myself.
The truth is, I know... but why now, after all this time...!?
I've been waiting for an answer.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
it's time to get out of there!
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
And you've been through that for 11 whole years...
His father's back was so big,
it made Hayama look small, which was kind of funny.
...tell me how well I've done.
Mm-hmm.
Watching her drama last night made me think about some things.
I videotaped it, so later, you should watch it too.
Hot! So I can't make any guarantees about the flavor. Hot! Hot!
You stay home and lie down.
Of course, he is a child...
Mm-hmm. A family has to get along with itself, huh?
Even better when your whole family uses it!
Why?
Oh, right, Sana-chan, I suppose that interview is out, isn't it?
With me!?
That's right! Asako-san picked me out!
She sure is nice! There's an air about her.
More or less.
She says he's her pimp.
Very well.
What do I do!? What do I do!? Rei-kun! Rei-kun!
I'm sorry, Sana-chan, I can't drive the car like this.
Not what I meant.
B- but Rei-kun, your illness...
You have it done, Sensei?
Sensei, you're such a good person...
Ah, Sana-chan, good morning!
That's okay. I'm glad you're here.
Huh? Where is your manager?
You know what? He used to be a hermit. But that's just between you and me.
Do something about it!
It's already recorded!
But... but...!
Job well done!
Huh?
Rei, it's you, isn't it!?
That's silly.
What's this? The post box is dancing!
Knowing her, she could have gotten someone a lot bigger than me.
Huh?
 Emergencies come unexpectedly! 
 calm yourself down, and make a smiling face. 
You can't play dumb with me!

--Geez, don't you remember how famous you are? --you eat them
I still have some glasses with eyes in them!
Why did you keep it a secret?
It's all right.
I can trust you, right, Rei-kun?
It almost feels like I'm the heroine of a Shojo manga!
But now, a woman from his past has come up. Makes me feel icky.
He nailed them to a tree in the dead of night, and then, using black magic,
You're... Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
She's avoiding you.
I'm home.
Oh, my. Why, how come, for what reason would you duck Sagami-kun?
Please, take your time.
Rei-kun, things have gone so smoothly between us up to now... Rei-kun...
Say, Mama, what are those people doing over there?
--That's why, even though she might be a child, --You can even be my pimp. I'll make sure
--I feel I have to think as much about her back. --I do a little work, myself.
I thought you didn't hear me.
Oh, you're right. There are quite a few. That's something to think about.
This is a good opp-uh-tunity.

Oh yeah? Not like you usually do, in your boyfriend's car?
You're dead serious, huh?

You don't need to come get me tomorrow, either.
You're dead serious, huh?
Depressing... too depressing...
As it turns out, the smile you've got on is a twisted one.
What's more, it's City Hall!
What is it?
Huh? What, what? Sounds interesting!
Aya-chan says there's a boy in this class that she likes!
Oh yeah? I hadn't heard. Who is it?
Welcome to the observation lounge.
Please! I mean it.
we won't be able to live in the middle of this huge earth, you know?
Sana-chan, you're strange. Same as always, though.
You know what? If you drink some juice, you might feel--
I- I really meant for nothing bad to happen to you, see?
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,

Listen, Zenjiro-chan, if you don't mind--
You can do anything if you set your mind to it! Whoopee!
We'll do it.
The next one? We just finished the seventh one, right?
What!?
A-yep!
--It'll be my birthday, too. --I know what I'm getting her. --What? What? What?
Whew, this is hard.
Okay, smile!
Sure enough...
and was really looking forward to it.
"Sana, the lonely wolf"
Aya-chan, you're too easy on her.
Rather, she seems to be enjoying herself.
Sagami?
Elegant and revitalizing, even in the jungle!
Okay.
How about we join in with their ostracizing?
Oki?
You bastards!
"Bothersome."
You call yourself that?
You sure are happy-go-lucky, huh?
Nobody said I got angry over you. I just blew my top, that's all.
Maybe I should go with the direct approach.
What's this?
Tsuyoshi-kun isn't here today. What could be the matter?
Tsuyoshi-kun is not the kind of boy that usually misses class, you know?
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
And our usual classroom...
What is the deal with this crazy, bald old man!? Run!
Oki Tsuyoshi is now Sasaki Tsuyoshi.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you.
He looks like he's going to snap!
and it was like she called out to me.
Wha--
Sana-chan, it's too dangerous here!
It's all ruined...
I don't care if you are Asako-san, this is wrong!
You keep your hands off of Rei-kun!
Okay, how about it? Ah, here it is.
 I really did it out of compassion, 
I'm a freshly hard-boiled Sana-chan!
If you got up at 4 o'clock to make that, you could be called an idiot.
Don't get so full of yourself!
Does this mean that instead of being the devil, you're a kissing fiend!?
If you're her boyfriend, then please, do a decent job of protecting Sana-chan.
Is that right? Thanks a lot.
Oh, it's the pimp.
you're Hayama-kun?
Do it as often as you like. It's quite enjoyable.
He kissed her!
Of course it was! I already have someone I like-- my boyfriend, Rei-kun.
Whassa matter, Sana-chan?
Oh? So you don't know what that means.
What I do know is that he is a kissing fiend!
Our guest tonight is Kurumi Asako-san.
Well, I've already more than kept my promise to Mama.
That's something I still can't tell even you about, Rei-kun.
T- thanks...
Sana-chan said something about me being the woman that started your misfortune,
and the house was taken from me.
so I started wandering around,
And that's my story.
You turned your back on me!
That was really great of you! You're so great! You're so great!
In dire straits,
he's there.
he's there,

Silence.
I- I am listening to you! And my love for Rei-kun is the real thing!
Sagami-kun, that's your way of showing consideration for Sana, huh?
I speak, and this is what happens.
Is Sana-chan here?
You know what? When you make an egg warm, it turns into a chick. Did you know that?
Go on and eat it, right away.
There was something that Mama said to me this one time!
Which brings us to your egg, Aono-chan!
Good for you, Aono-chan!
and completely forgotten about whatever it was that was bothering me.
Sana has to leave a little early.
What sloppy handwriting!
It's bothering me! It's bothering me! Rei-kun running away!
After Sagami-kun gets it, he brings it to me.
Him, a boyfriend? He's just pretending, you know.
How can you laugh at a child about being a child!?
No... No...!
Hey!
You can't go home? If you can't go home, what will you do?
And if you had never met Sunglasses-san,
I may not like how embarrassed I feel right now, but, but, but...
That's right! Mm-hmm, I'm sure of it! That's right!
than to never have seen it at all!
Nope.

--Sickening! --Comical!!

Oh, is that so? Yeah. Sure you would be.
Even so...
Why don't you go home?

Not especially.

What fate awaits Kurata Sana?
--with Rei-kun. --We'll decide on the wardrobe while we're there...
...but as a performer, Sana-chan, I'm sure--
Thank you!
You'll have to forgive me. My brilliant manager
"Well, even so... it's only for a little while..."
Nice and energetic, Sana-chan! Good, good!
We're boxers! We know no pity! We're boxers!

At this point, I'm bursting with energy!
--Onto the next one! Onto the next one!

You booked more commercial work?
Mm-hmm, four more of them.
I thought that we could keep going,
Right!
too affectionately.
Yes?
She has abandoned her womanhood, after all.
...or so Mama said, right?
Sana-chan...
--so skinny!
I see, so if that's why he kissed me, then it all zebra-tails.
Yikes, what are you choking on, Father?
Sana, it's for you, from Hayama-kun.
It's not exactly like he called me there...
Sure enough, I'll go!
What am I going to do...?
"Father Hayama..."
Mm-hmm, it's something that does happen. He's developed a stomach ulcer.
So, I want to keep him in the hospital for 15 days or so
Bye, now. Take good care of Father Hayama, okay?
So he's trying to say "thank you," huh!?
Not at all! You're welcome!
Geez, I wish I had an interpreter when I talk to him.
No problems with anything?
All right, all right.
Oh, manipulate men in the palm of my hand.
And our usual classroom...
...for two.
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
Okay, introduce yourself.
Hayama, be strong.
So, in oth-uh woids, "Dappi" is when you can't poop, even if you really try.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Zenjiro-sensei! Me! Me! Pick me! Yes, yes, yes!
Sana-than, wrap it up, wrap it up.
It's also what you call it when you abandon old ideas
You could say that, too. But is that costume what you were wearing und-uh--neath?
You can do anything if you set your mind to it! Whoopee!
Um, hello? About the commercial...
Nicely done!
What!?
Again?
Way to go, Sana-chan. Stick with it, even if it's tough.
It'd sure be nice if they did...
Hey, hey, steady now.
--It'll be my birthday, too. --I know what I'm getting her. --What? What? What?
Did you just laugh at me, Akito-kun?
I fell.
Sana-chan, if you like, take this juice home with you.
Edokko Rice Crackers are Japan's best!
Is she worn out?
She decided to do them herself.
I'm sorry.
Sana-chan looks kind of somber.
It's okay. I'll only be busy for a little while longer.
Then again, she is surprisingly delicate.
Sana-chan! I, Sagami Rei, will protect you,

Looks like those girls are amusing themselves by shunning Kurata.
If you don't tell me, how am I supposed to know?
Hayama and Oki apparently got angry at the other boys
Being the lone wolf is my thing. It doesn't suit you.
I have you to thank for that, Hayama.
or something we shouldn't be doing,
Most of them will start coming out next month.
They're burying the hatchet already? How boring.
Ah, Hayama-kun, something terrible has happened!
Hayama! What is it? What's wrong? Are you leaving?
"Back against the wall."
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
Sensei, have you heard any word from Tsuyoshi?
Just come with me!
--Money is not the issue here! --Don't act so smug over a measly 50 million!
Hey there, you're at odds.
Oh, look at the way he's losing it! He's Tsuyoshi-kun's dad, all right!
So that's the kind of dad he has, huh? I didn't know.
Since way back...
His dad could have been going nuts like that this whole time.
Mm-hmm, the way he snapped, yeah. But if that's the case...
You touch someone's breasts, then pass it off like it was nothing...!
Akito-kun and Sana-chan!
Is that 50...?
Right! "We"!
Please let us handle the bigger boxes.
While I was out shopping, I went to see Akito-kun's father.
You don't say. That's great news, Akito-kun.
Your chick is on the veranda!
Tsuyoshi, what should we give to the neighbors when we greet them?
--Open the shutoff valve. --Where's the next volume of this manga?
We've got most of it put away, huh?
Okay, you're coming to school for sure tomorrow, right?
Damn straight.
You really helped us out today.
It was no trouble at all.
Sana-chan...
Okay, see you tomorrow at school!
Huh? We have a visitor?
Tsuyoshi-kun, huh? Hmm, what kind of animal does he remind me of...?
...is an extreme worrywart!
an8"That's not it"
Now you can cling to your mom that much more tightly, can't you?
I'll bet you say that.
That's one for the books-- Sugita raising her voice like that...
Tsuyoshi-kun has always been affectionate toward his mom,
I love Tsuyoshi-kun!!
Last year, Sana-chan gave me chocolate on Valentine's Day.
Right, right, all of the boys in my class were nice guys,
Ah! Sana-chan is going to be on TV!
Happy birthday,
an8"Tsuyoshi-kun, happy birthday!!"
Sana-chan...
Mm-hmm!
Here. I just bought them. Take them with you.
Bye, now.
The summer of my promise has come so suddenly!
"Kodomo no Omocha "
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
That's why I'm taking a little from each of them, so that it adds up to 500 total.
You didn't have to buy 500,000's worth, though.
Why not?
I really like the stage.
It looks like this... is going to get very serious.
Mm-hmm. I see... I had a hunch this would be coming up soon.
Sana, why does a girl like you...
--Nope. I did bring my curling iron, though. --Well...
You're one astounding idiot, huh?
Once I get home, Mama will have finished her manuscript,
I wonder if there are any real fireflies around.
Everybody, please split up into each of your rooms and wash up!
Right about now, Mama's manuscript must be coming right along...
But with enough force of nerve, I'm going to be nice and regular!
W- what are you staring at!? Oh, you want to go at it!?
You've been acting strange lately, you know?
What fun, what fun, what fun, what fun, what fun!
S- such children!
--that these students let things go to their heads! --I don't hate it.
Just allowing students to see us like this will be a problem,
That's Principal Narunaru for you! He understands!
they, er, engage in extremely precocious activities!
the problems in 3rd Class have decreased.
...said something principal-like!
Does everyone watch Child's Toy!?
an8"Badger" "Catfish"
Give it up, until it gets quiet up there.
You've already got two previous convictions!
I'm not so good at it that I could act out my whole private life!
Something has happened, hasn't it?
...the enjoyable life that Mama and I share...
Kamura Naozumi? Who are you!?
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 15; the fated series marches on!
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-hatter,
Then Sana-chan fought him head-on, and scored a great victory!
But then, whoops! Behind him was a really boneheaded father-daughter team!
You're worried about something, huh?
Y-yes...?
The content of my essay?
W- well it's...
I- it's...?
an8"Pbbbt!"
Her husband will have to marry into her family.
Sure, someday.
What are you laughing at?
Anyhow, everyone thinks that our home has gotten a little bit more enjoyable,
thanks to you.
It's amazing that you don't think to yourself,
Hayama is putting everything he has into telling me this...
I saw it! I saw it! I saw it! Hayama is embarrassed!
But you just barely smiled, didn't you?
 Hayama, smile! Let's see it! 
-- And while we're at it, let's dance!  --Cut it out! Cut it out!
 How rare, how rare, seeing Hayama smile! 
 Smile! Smile! Ha ha ha, ha! 
Would you guys give it a rest, already?
Yeah.
Rei-kun, long time no see!
The essay will be published around the end of summer.
--By the way, I'm playing the heroine this year! --Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom!
Just kidding! New Kid's Foam, now on sale!
Mm-hmm, but you know what?
She's not just cute; being on TV this much, Sana-chan is amazing.
and I'll be shooting it real soon.
H- how? My mom saw an ad in a magazine and told me.
Mm-hmm, it said the title would be "My Daughter and I."
I promised her she could a long time ago, so there's nothing I can do about it.
It's all right. I've made up my mind to take things easy, after all.
Still, if I ever start feeling like I want to cry...
I'll be relying on you, Hayama!
--"Waugh! We've had it! --"Waugh! We've had it!
Behold! As learned in Gekidan Komawari, the marvelous... un... deux... troi...!
By the way, is that boy Kamura-kun here yet?
--Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Kamura Naozumi. --Stop me!
Naozumi-kun brings you a bouquet of flowers and a box of Heal-Band. Got it?
--I am a genius at this, after all! --and has appeared in several other things, I'm sure of it.
Heal-Band.
Who are you!?
to always go along with the scenario.
he's there.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
And after my heart stops pounding over this,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
I always feel Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
My manager, Sagami Rei-kun, is my former boyfriend.
But listen! I have a weakness for fried shrimp!
What? What? What? That's not it?
that was just something that happened by accident!
After all, Uchiyamada-kun's stomach got upset so quickly,
Did you think you had some kind of dirt on me!?
Come off it!
Never mind the details, just look.
For crying out loud, I wasn't sure what to think!
Until the book comes out, watch yourself.
W- what?
I- I couldn't!
Onda Takezo-san!
You can't hold out anymore...
--...Sana-chan is twirling. --Okay, lift your legs!
What do you want?
I don't know.
--This doesn't really have anything to do with me. --Just go, would you?
It's only polite to thank someone who gives you something, right?
Do you know anything?
This has been the white bat, Babbit.
I, Zenjiro, will not let anything stand in the way of cheering for her!
Then again, maybe she acts more child-like when she's on TV.
You're kidding me...
Huh? Akito-kun?
Mama taught it to me once, when Rei-kun was pretending to be sick.
Sana-chan will be playing the part of this Eucie, right?
That's an incredible amount, for not even being with any agencies.
It's starting.
The army is coming again!
I'm sick of this war!
We have to enjoy life! Let's forget all the bad things and dance!
Father!
And now, we would like our special guest...
...Kamura Naozumi-kun, to present our lead, Kurata Sana-San,
--Terrific! That was magnificent! --Hello? It's me, Zenjiro. Can I come ov-uh today?
No? But I just had my hawt broken. Please?
Would you like to give it a try?
The next heart-pounder is coming.
The second act is about to begin.
...panic!!
while the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!
Ah, What a Surprise! Mama's Book
and for an American feeling, Texas!
--Thank you very much! --Sana-chan, I watch you all the time!
Oh, sorry!
That's because you just squished your nose.
What should I do? He looks like a cameraman from a magazine.
I just had my picture taken by a real cameraman!
With that face?
Empty-promiser! Faker! Who cares about you!?
and I had some other messes to take care of...
Just to be safe, stay home from school tomorrow.
and haven't gotten much exercise, so this is perfect.
Right?
So, he's the one she divorced when she was twenty?
The rich kind!
Nope!
You live in a mansion like this; Misako-san, your books are selling,
Mama, isn't it this one?
--After him! --You bet!
The one that cost 30,000, huh?
or the scroll hanging in the alcove?
Come back anytime!
Salt!
-- When you don't have ginger, use grated garlic.  -- we give him a hard time, 
I better not let those two turn against me.
According to this book, Kurata Misako-san's only daughter,
Oh, they're here, all right.
but at least become a little more famous than other children.
Say, this says...
and that's why I tried so hard to have you.
S- Sensei, your hair!
She's wearing it normally!
I thought about it for many years before doing this.
Naturally, I imagined what all of you were going to say.
Bye!
--I just can't believe that you do! Sana-chan is still in elementary school! --Rei-kun! Hold on! Rei-kun!
...up to now, just for today,
...for two.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 18 of the "Relationships of Fate and Ramen" saga,
and for an American feeling, Texas!
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
Hayama!
Glad you liked it.
Don't you lie to me! You're just a letch!
He's right. It is a little suffocating at home...
That's the first time Mama and Rei-kun ever got into a fight.
Huh...? Suddenly, I feel sleepy...
Wait! Don't fall asleep here!
"Sana grew up to be an incredibly cheerful and spirited girl."
and my daughter was chosen to play the lead,
"Young Sana's smiling face always brought me happiness."
Yes... Yes... I see. I thought so.
If it is all right with you,
we were thinking of letting her stay here for two or three days.
I don't even know how I should act around Sana-chan.
Huh? It's night...
Oh, are you still in here?
You perve!
an8"Hayama, are you really...?"
Still, there are a few. Look!
Right, like the three stars in the Orion constellation.
But I'm not telling you where they are.
How did you know that!?
Yo.
Me neither.
It's no use! Once I feel hungry, there's no going back!
On top of that, Hayama's clothes fit me perfectly.
Let's go buy some ramen!
This week's Akito-kun.
It's just a person's weight dummy.
You idiots! How can you look at this and say it looks like a giraffe!?
I can't stand it! This has to be bothering the othuh residents!
Okay then, everyone, good evening.
--Ah, it's Zenjiro-san!
Ah, sorry.
Done!
I humbly partake!
Just read the first characters.
Once the doctor told me, I was despondent over that number."
The press conference was held after the taping of his drama,
Yes. That is where I grew up.
and the press conference came to an end.
He seemed like a prince from another country.
Well, she won't tell me her name,
Tsuyoshi, I'm going home early, so tell the teacher for me.
In dire straits,
...for two.
Tsuyoshi-kun isn't here today. What could be the matter?
What did you call me!?
I'll say it a hundred times!
When did you get your hands on that?
Here, I got you a moistened handkerchief to put on that forehead.
That lousy old man...!
W- why, you...!
You touch someone's breasts, then pass it off like it was nothing...!
If Tsuyoshi-kun does call, Rei-kun will let me know over my Burutcha.
Hey!
but I didn't think they'd actually get divorced...
We're almost done with all of the finding a new apartment
and moving in and everything.
There are all kinds of dads. Bald dads, fat dads,
Mother, I'm moving the phone cord over here.
--Whoa! Don't carry so much! --I'm throwing these away.
T- Tsuyoshi-kun...
Tsuyoshi-kun...
B- be a man, and stop crying.
I'm the oldest son... so, from now on... from now on, I have to...
...I have to be strong...
Ee-yow... I was just kidding...
I'm back!
Sana-chan, did you find out anything about Tsuyoshi-kun?
I've never seen Hayama-kun panic like that.
Hang in there, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Over-the-hill cue ball!
 Life has its clear days and cloudy days! 
but I hope you'll continue to regard me the same as you always have.
Way to go, Tsuyoshi!
Aya-chan, don't tell me that the boy you're in love with is...
Listen, Tsuyoshi-kun, I didn't even know you last Valentine's Day!
--so I gave it to another boy who was standing nearby... --Take it! Take it! Take it!
That was you, Tsuyoshi-kun!?
You're heartless.
Getting close to him is dangerous!
Things have been so up-in-the-air this year.
One, two, three...
an8"Tsuyoshi-kun, happy birthday!!"
--Sana-chan... --Sana-chan, you mean it's not your boithday?
"Keep hanging in there. Aya"
Good luck with Akito-kun.
Hayama, did you just snicker to yourself?
Apples?
Bye, now.
Where's your dad?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
...for two.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
It's come... It's come!
at last, the fated series gets underway!
"Kodomo no Omocha "
I may he a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ha-ha-ha-ha-hang!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
The girl that I gave birth to
--'lo. --You're looking well.
Uh-huh! Abandon her, abandon her!
Please don't worry about it. On the contrary,
We're at a loss, too.
Don't say it like it's nothing!
I couldn't really get a handle on it, no matter what you told me, anyhow.
...when is my birthday?
 I'm pretty sure this little baby... 
What if I was actually born on March 6th?
Oh, I get it. "Sam."
A ring worn on the left ring finger is a wedding ring.
Huh? Well, she is, right?
Okay, see you Sunday at Ribbonland!
What's going on!? Akito-kun, do you know anything!?
Oh, I see...
an8"What are you doing here!?"
This week's Sana-chan. Take it easy on the disguises, though.
Her name is Mariko-chan, huh?
Hurry, hurry!
Mama, she dwopped something!
Thank you.
That's right, Sana-chan! I'm here to have a good time today.
--Wow! Sana-chan! Sana-chan! --Looks like it worked out okay.
Oh, shh, okay? I'm undercover today.
Wow, I'm getting dizzy!
Okay, Mariko-chan, right, right! Ah, left!
Wimp!
--Sana-chan, is this Cindewewwa? --Hi-ho! Akito-kun, having fun?
Keiko-san, thank you. I'm glad I got to meet Mariko-chan.
Yo, my friends! Let's go home!
To be frank, I don't feel the least bit of concern towards you.
There is one thing, ma'am.
H- huh...?
Keiko-san asked me if I would ever come live with her.
It must have been rough, huh?
"Sam thank you very much!"
Stop!
"Sam have a pen! Something one!"
to always go along with the scenario.
My heart may he settled, but my mind is in a...
...up to now, just for today,
And our usual classroom...
Feeling Good With a Sana-chan Quiz!
Next to huh, the boy who brags that he's the reason
Everything was fine up until now...
It's time to do arithmetic! It has already started!
We're already 30 minutes late!
and leads the boys in everything.
Dracula!
and finding out what his weakness is.
It's an "Easy for Everyone Bungee Jump Set!" It cost 30,000 yen.
When you jump, whoever yells the loudest loses.
If I win, you're not allowed to meddle in anything I do, all right?
She's just showing off.
Forgive me, Akito-kun!
I'm sorry. I won't do it any more.
How are we supposed to know that!?
Oh, no! I can't let myself play into his hand...
You're the one who killed Mother, after all!
I'll do my best in this drama!
You are such a thoroughly aggravating fellow!
Now then,
Don't just sit around here eating your food, go watch my drama!
Say, Hayama...
I see. Uh-huh, I guess not, huh?
why did you have me?
--Wait till you see what happens in the second half! --What an oversight!
Rei-kun! Rei-kun! Rei-kun!
Um, could you be mistaking me for someone else?
--Kurumi Asako-san, Rei-kun's previous girlfriend from way back, --I'm all fired up for this!
Now then, what kind of picture is this photograph,
Hey, what is this!? That's cheating!
Don't worry about a thing.
you will get 15 points!
Sagami-kun is an adult, and you cannot be the object of his affection.
It's not true...
Even so, you stood by me and listened to what I had to say,
N- now that you mention it...
Right?
You can get back with Asako-san.
Now then, for the final question.
Sana-chan is going for the win!
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 21 of the Crash of the Sea and Fireworks Saga:
Sana-chan might go wild after all this time--
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
Sana-chan, telephone for you.
Me!?
"Huh? Kamura Academy? Right now?"
But what about the taping!?
It's too late to be jealous now.
so I wound up letting Naozumi-kun take me.
Something wrong, Sana-chan?
What is it, Sana-chan?
There's no "little bit" about it! Where in the world are you driving!?
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Is Sana-chan coming, too?
--Wow! It's really her!
Or rather, I don't remember it at all, but when I was little,
What kind of defiant little kid is this!?
--It's not Tokyo, or Osaka, or Nagoya! --And yet, look at how cheerful she is.
I took the plunge and let him give it a try. I tell him it's okay now,
Isn't that nice of him?
I was just goofing around!
It's even delicious raw! Meat, meat, meat, meat!
Ko-chan! Ko-chan, you're the one who's doing this, aren't you!?
That's right.
Well, I will admit that I am a little more full of zip than other people...
--Sana-chan, you go first!
That tears it.
That car...!
and the super-strong vacuum cleaner!?
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
We sure would like to go for a drive.
Three!
Who is Hayama?
Director, is that the only thing you can say?
She's an idiot, all right.
Don't you look cool now, exposed little boy?
Look here, look here, if you want me to return this to you,
Let's split our butts already.
Hayama, when did you get here?
that good little boys and girls can look up to, after all.
Really?
What did I just tell you!?
What's this now? You really do have something to say, don't you?
Hey! Are you playing with fire again!?
Oh, so that's it!
I'm Mika!
--We are the Sannas!
"Back against the wall."
to always go along with the scenario.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
I want to retire, and that's that. I'm going to play a little bit now!
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
and for an American feeling, Texas!
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
My beloved Mama is an Aoki-award winning novelist.
This is the white bat, Babbit, Babbit! Come on, come on!
Bingo!
After that... after that... okay!
Hayama, huh?
What do you want to learn? Techniques to let you win fights?
...if you're going to pursue this, now's the best time.
 --The barbecue-cue is lit,  --I'm no good...
 --Let's sing, hey, hey!  --I'm no good...
--Aya-chan, seems like you and Tsuyoshi are getting along pretty well lately. --Rei-kun, you okay?
Hey, hey, ho, I know.
No thank you.
because I thought it would be an effective way to have lots of people read
"My Daughter and I."
Akito-kun!
but the boys can't hold their own against the rest of the world.
Isn't that what you want to say, Tsuyoshi-kun?
I can't believe that our Hayama-kun is cleaning.
Maybe I should quit "Child's Toy."
because I am a child, you know! I'm in grade school! I'm a child!
With Sana-chan around, we can rest easy about the ratings!
Sana-chan's gonna retire!?
That's life. Everyone gets through it and goes on to live happily.
then your big brothuh will teach them a lesson! Like this, and this!
Yum!
Mm-hmm...
Sana-chan! I will be on your side in all things!
Thank you!
Tomorrow's schedule is wide open!
Please don't do anything foolish--
Stop!
All right, today I'll teach you the most basic of the basics, the forward punch.
Clouds! Sky!
That was the first taping of "Child's Toy" that Sana-chan was at.
Yes, let's cry.
Mm-hmm! I'm quitting quitting!
Hey! Who is that, making so much noise in someone else's yard
to always go along with the scenario.
he's there.
Oh, my younger sister Mariko-chan has gone missing!
Next time, on "Kodomo no Omocha," episode 23, the Adventures of Zenjiro-san and Mariko-chan Saga,
I always feel Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
I'm hitting something, right!?
"Become proficient in the things you enjoy.
You can win like this?
At the time, you promised never to see them again, right?
Don't use the show for your own poiposes!
Mawiko wants to see Sana-chan! I wanna see her!
But can you stay here and play by yourself?
Okay, I'll be right back. Stay here, okay?
Mm-hmm! It's really her!
Sane-yan, where am I!?
Don't eat that! That's my lunch!
You wanna go at it!? I'll show you no moicy, even if you are a kid!
Sana-chan, where are you?
Ah, that's a drag.
I'm having some guys on my old route look for her.
Ah, it's your Burutcha. Is Sana-chan trying to contact you? A code?
"Burutcha Cryptology for Former Boss Monkeys Kurata Sana, Editor in Chief"
Let's see...
Ah! You're that kid from before, aren't you!?
Huh?
You want me to look for this kid's parents? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

Sour! Sour!
Mariko-chan! Mariko-chan, I'm coming to find you right now!
My husband, Mariko's father.
Let's look for her! Mariko-chan must be inside the station!
Whaddya know? Looks like Sana-chan is busy, too.
Mawiko isn't going home until she sees Sana-chan!
Mariko!
Awl right, awlready! What a nuisance! Who is it!?
What's going on?
After all, the code that Akito-kun deciphered doesn't make any sense.
...panic!!
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
it's time to get out of there!
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
an8"That's still a long way off..."
Children, please don't be shocked when you hear this...
Sensei, how come!?
A te---st!
The test is in three days. Those who do not get passing grades
Is that understood!?
You've still got an ogre's face.
Of course.
Mitsuya-sensei...
If you don't know the formulas, or how to solve anything, ask away.
 And in second grade, I fell flat. 
 and once again, I was back in the crapper.

The rest of my life!?
Hisae-chan, Tsuyoshi-kun, and Hayama, wouldn't it!?
an8"Sana-chan sings"
But, before that, you need a little boost!
 --And multiply them!  --What's so bad about math?
Guys, stand by me, okay? Okay? Okay?
A photograph.
you'll do as I say.
Why, Hayama!?
Hayama...
Look, if you do it this way, it gets picked up, see?
Aah, Aya-chan, what should I do!?
--And here I gave you back that naked photo of you! --What is she talking about?
Once everyone sees that photo... especially once Andoh-sensei sees it...
We're finished.
Make-out picture!
They've been running around for over ten minutes now.
Making out-- teachers, making out! How disgraceful! How vulgar!
W-well...
If you have to test us, at least make it a little later!
S- she's on fire...
No...!
Yeah! Yeah!
Limbo dance!?
The students are cheering me on! This is without question...
Do your math, too!
...for two.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Huh? They still say it now?
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
The mysterious white bat straight man.
My voice is doing fine!
Ah, Sana-chan, it's Kurosuke! Kurosuke!
I can give him water with this?
Mm-mm...
My, what a cute little bat!
Just kidding.
"Suzuki"
Ba-bing, push the button, ba-bing!
Would you go home without doing anything!?
Come on, you were going to talk about Hayama, right? Come on, come on!
He's a lot cuter than that strange animal loitering around over there, huh?
She said that just because you apologized,
we're still kids, and we're still young,
 becoming friends again, happy-py! 
Good morning.
Now for a model... all right, there's one!
You there, come here a minute.
We put this on him...
Mami-chan!
This is kind of fun, huh?
Mm-hmm! That is cute!
No fair running away, Akito-kun.
What Hayama-kun did to Mami-chan
you won't be able to provide enough first aid to either Mami-chan's scars,
"Sane-yan" appears to be a name that only Zenjiro calls him by.
Babbit is going to call him that too. Sane-yan!
I did it! Water spilled returned with a bang!
Oh, he's off, is he?
Sana-chan, Mami-chan...
Oh, how cute! Look, I drew someone playing the saxophone.
Hayama, you paint something, too!
an8"Kurosuke..."
Mami-chan!
Hayama, wait up!
You forgot your melon.

Tsuyoshi-kun, by any chance, is it because of this?
How are we supposed to hang around with those oban hags?
Mm-mm, but still, I'll be fine.
Hayama! What did you do that for!? Would you mind staying out of my way!?
She's not too quick-witted...
Dull-witted girl...
Where? Where?
It's the chick from back then.
Wow, this is the chick from before?
I don't give things out willy-nilly!
Shut up!
Do something about that!
Can chickens do tricks?
Welcome back, Aono.
We've come to visit.
Hayama!
Say, Aono-chan, I'll take Piyoko to my house.
So, how about we ask her to take him for a little while
so I can take responsibility for the lie I told.
You had some fried chicken just this morning, didn't you?
Rei-kun! Rei-kun, that's a yellow card!
I like you. I'll write for you. Come along.
Thank you very much!
and cause problems for everyone else?
Nice work! Thank you very much! Good night!
What's this, Sana-chan? That's an awfully funny-looking baby!
and go on living without giving up, Sana-chan.
This is hopeless!
Then, it was because of Piyoko?
Sagami-kun went right after her, so I think he'll find her soon. Don't worry.
We'll think of something for Piyoko together one more time!
Sana is determined to fight alongside Piyoko and Hachiko!
...for two.
And our usual classroom...
This man is Mama's ex-husband, Kashima Ryosuke-san.
--"I don't have any money to lend you!" --"I don't have any money to lend you!"
Did I get him?
"Give Me Sympathy and Lend Me Money"
which was ranked third on "This Week's Lamest Best Ten" on TV.
Will you be content if I say so, Sana-chan?
Mama's ex-husband gave it to me! What can I do!?
 I'm out of negatives, but still, he's a nice guy. 
It may be woik, but this is hawsh.
Are you okay, Zenjiro-sensei?
I'm in the middle of work, so bye.
J- just a minute! The truth of it is--
You still need something from me?
However, it takes money to dream in the real world.
Sana-chan!
You see, a sumaki is--
Here are your datemaki omelet rolls. Thank you for waiting.
Still, that much will be enough.
or hurt me, would have such a caring look on their face.
You can! Sure you can! If you can do it, you can do it!
All right! I'll do what I can for you, ex-husband!
What do you think you're doing!?
--I don't know, why don't you ask him? --Then I'll build a high-falutin' house, and have a lawts of pretty goils,
Sana-chan, what kind of woik is this?
It's tasty woik, right? If so, count me in.
I got some tasty woik!
--Him! Sensei's ex-husband! --This isn't gonna be any dawdgy woik, no.
Huh? You're going to work for him?
Kissing me against my will...
That's amazing. I'm surprised.
or whether you're a gagster,
Uh, what kind of work is this?
Hey, hey, what do you think you're doing to this Kyoto, taxi grade-school kid!?
What is it you'd have a 6th grader do!? I'll sue you! I'll curse you!
I'll even get your grandchildren back for this!
...is tonight's showtime.
We've done 27 events in a row.
There are 30 more events before this evening for you.
All else aside, Mama is still a woman, after all.
It may sound strange coming from me,
Hey, this is cheap!
How is this tasty woik!?
Mm-hmm.
It's showtime!!
-- Isn't that obvious!?  -- Isn't that obvious!? 
-- save the world from a crisis!  -- save the world from a crisis!  --I- I'm sure they want to be saved.
Ryosuke-kun is not such a bad person. I guarantee it.
Right!
--When you need to be secretive,
Well, he did tell a lot of fibs, and tricked me, and all, but still,
On the doll... on the doll...!
Your tenacity is commendable!
And our usual classroom...
You don't even talk to your own child about his mother very often,
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 28, the "Who is that Beauty at the Gravesite Visit?" saga,
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
I always feel Relax,
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Sana-chan, come visit us again soon.
Sana-chan...!
ever had a birthday party, Hayama?
Nope.
What for?
I think my mom would like to see something unusual once in a while.
Can't you just split your butt
Y- yes... yes she was. Akito,
so you all go on ahead.
I still don't know her.
For some reason, it seems like I've seen her somewhere before,
Eh?
A mysterious Beautiful?
an8"Cemetery visit complete"
Life is a dazzling trip down the lost path of love...
Then, right now, Father Hayama really is...
Naive!
Father Hayama's attitude when we visited the cemetery was suspicious--
Come on, let's go!
I don't know...
Positively. That producer kills me.
How awful!
Now that I think about it, I had no idea I was so...
Oh, you're planning to play it cool through till the end, huh?
Unfortunately, in my estimation, there can be no mistake about it.
I remember now.
It happens quite frequently in dramas.
Back when I was little, he used to talk a lot about Mom,
he would first say "there's somebody that I'd like you to meet," or something.
I'm home.
Oh, yes.
Her name is Daiichi Shiori-san, and she was your mom's best friend.
No! No! Sana-chan, what do we do!?
When is this anime going to become suitable for good little children?
Okay, Baby's Rock!
an8"Burutcha secret code transmission"
Rei-kun! Rei-kun! There's something I want you to bring me
Understood! Don't move from that spot, Sana-chan!
Not to worry! Just call it my "Mission, Mark II."
So, your father had to go out, did he?
It's decorated to Father Hayama's tastes!
What's more, he wears this on his head around the house!
I'm mad!
so now, why don't I tell some stories of my own?
He's a shocking father, our Father Hayama.
-- He's a shocking father,  -- He's a shocking father, 
some stories about your mother.
I put Akito through a lot of misery.
Well, I guess I'm embarrassed, too.
we get to eat lots of mochi rice cakes at New Year's!
After all, we get to eat sakuramochi and kashiwamochi rice cakes!
which will be written "Autumn person"-- "Aki-to."
Really?
Yeah, a very fine dad!
And our usual classroom...
...up to now, just for today,
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 29, the Disruptive Grandma from the Hot Spring Resort saga,
I always feel Relax,
Sagami Rei-kun, my chauffeur and manager, and former boyfriend.
Where's your dad?
what with me knowing all about the Hayama family,
Sana, how about we fulfill your promise?
One of them was that I would become a famous novelist.
Mm-hmm. I see... I had a hunch this would be coming up soon.
When will it be published?
We're going!
Good morning, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Now, now, Ando-sensei, it's too early in the morning to be getting worked up.
What kind of snacks did you bring?
The commotion that will follow is a foregone conclusion.
So, did you want something?
My dad came home from the hospital yesterday.
He said to tell you thanks.
All right! I'll give it a shot!
 Woah, this country road is treacherous! 
Everybody, please split up into each of your rooms and wash up!
Supper is at 6 o'clock... 6 o'clock in the banquet hall...
Listen to me, if you don't listen, you won't be able to eat dinner.
Ooh, the meat is all gone!
I'll take this meat!
Raw is fine! I like anything that's raw!
They're all still children, after all.
I'll work up enough force of nerve and guts to achieve regularity again!
Yo.
You've been acting strange lately, you know?
Spacing off all the time, and stuff.
The secret's out!
--that these students let things go to their heads! --Hayama, you like sushi?
Your makeup fell off.
Immediately return to your rooms!
let alone letting them join us! If the PTA finds out...
I knew you'd say that.
"Beep" doesn't tell me anything.
Still, I think Hayama-kun has become better-behaved
The principal...
an8"Restrooms"
--The scenery here is terribly pretty. --Sana-chan, the mountain is this way.
Oh, Zenjiro-chan! How come!? How come!? "Why"!? What's the deal!?
Are they shooting a TV show?
Uchiyamada-kun!
--Just kidding! --Just kidding!
"For some reason, it's suddenly limbo time!"
What is it, lady?
I don't care how good she is, it's only as high as a milk bottle.
This week's Sana-chan! Alien-style. What do you think?
Come to think of it, it's dangerous to get too close to him!
Okay, don't do anything!
Last night, before we went and joined the teachers.
Then why would you say such a thing?
You're worried about something, huh?
--Is it that complicated? --I guess I'm a little nervous.
to always go along with the scenario.
...panic!!
And our usual classroom...
After following after a firefly, I fell down a cliff.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
Right!
I am her second-in-charge, Katagiri Sanzo.
while passing through Kusatsu.
That was back during the Edo period!
No matter what anyone says, I am not going back to Kusatsu-
Dad! What do you mean, the buses have left!?
See? He's just the sort of handsome man that you like, right?
I play a little ping pong.
The next gentleman.
Yes, hailing from Kusatsu-
to Kusatsu, aren't they, Mother?
In any case, I absolutely refuse to have that type of man!
an8"Onda, you fool!! Heh heh heh heh"
Madam Misako.
Please wait for me, Madam Misako! Madam!
There was one letter that arrived, saying she would not be returning to Kusatsu.
Afterward, she found a child who had been abandoned...
--Things head off in another direction!! --I'm starting to want to go to the hot springs now...
Yes, ma'am.
It's unusual for her not to come visit
while the Kusatsu hot springs are over here.
Well now, it appears that Mother has given up,
S- Sensei, our deadline is-
I'll have Spaghetti Vongole, heavy on the Tabasco,
and a lowfat milk banana shake.
Okay, one moment please.
Thank you for waiting!
Katagiri!
There is nobody else besides her. Make preparations at once!
...that grandmother, that grandmother, that fine, fine grandmother of yours...
Sana-chan, do you like working on TV?
Not at all. I'm not bothered one bit.
Before I go home to Kusatsu, I'd like to see the sights of Tokyo.
Hm? Who is that boy with the unusual aura coming off of him?
This?
Now that you mention it, her personality is suited to being the mistress of an inn.
That's my mother's judgment for you! She's sharp! I approve!
I wonder if I'm fit to be a head clerk...
This way, please. This way, please.
You have all shown up so early...
Hey, aren't you adapting a little too quickly?
It would appear that those two are getting along well.
Good afternoon.
Did you just bow?
This boy...
Not especially. I've never been.
Those eyes... aren't human...
H- hey!
To celebrate Grandma coming to see us for the first time in four years,
Wow, Shimura-san, that looks delicious!
How are you going to stay with her?
We will see you later!
he's there.
...for two.
What's more, in the show, she's engaged to this guy, Kimuchi Takuya-kun.
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
Sana-chan, the teacher isn't here. She said to have study hall for an hour.
After all... after all, you're Asako-san's boyfriend, Rei-kun-
The world of show business is filled with nothing but good-looking, handsome people.
If you space off, then wham, Asako-san will be taken away from you like that!
"I am Kurumi Asako's boyfriend."
Okay!
Well, shua.
Ready? You do this, then this, then you say "It's Kim-Kim!"
He tells jokes, too!
He's handsome, he's kind, and he's funny.
That hurt.
I've got a location shoot for a movie, so if you'll excuse me...
I- it can't be...
W- well, I used to be something of a fan of Asako-san before,
Do you usually use a chop on girls!?
Never mind them, you want to go see it now?
Huh? Not me. Maybe you imagined it?
No, Sana-chan, you can't yell like that.
That goes for bad boys and girls, too.
"This is a nice place."
Asako!!
Right. She is an actress. One kiss scene won't... one kiss scene won't...
...is a relationship where you trust each other, is that what you're trying to say?
You mean she's not kissing him because she loves him,
The rumors about you getting married are true, then?
if Rei-kun ever found out...
Huh? But I can't dance.
Hello! I'm a strange young man who dances everywhere... everywhere... everywhere...
 Sneaking photos of them on their date? 
Goodbye! There's nothing tasty to see here!
More reporters and such could still come barging in on you.
W- what!?
Mama...
And here, I'm the director...
Let's see... Kurumi Asako-san, whom I'm sure you all know...
Rei, did those rumors about Kimuchi-kun bother you?
I can't stand this! Hey!
Kurata Sana, you're going to rock the weekly tabloids next!
Hey, can you see Babbit? Who exactly are you?
to always go along with the scenario.
And our usual classroom...
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
so BOY, take a look my way!
And our usual classroom...
but this reporter who just showed up is in a league all his own!
"Kodomo no Omocha"
and yet you always shilly-shally,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
The mysterious straight man, Babbit.
Would you out out that "super" business!
Naozumi-kun and I were waiting on standby.
In short, while we were waiting on standby, I borrowed Naozumi-kun's handheld game.
Oh, this part, you see...
Okay, any questions?
Rei-kun, I'm going to walk.
 How can I be an entertainer, 
 Naozumi-kun is just a friend from work. 
A little precocious, like you are on TV, then.
Huh? Hold on a second!
You just have to give me a simple answer.
Ah, Sana-chan, Sana-chan!
What's wrong with you? The shoot is about to start! Let's go, let's go!
--That would be the cordial thing to do. --...is constipation medicine, aloha owe...
He's an unbelievable snake reportuh.
and I followed her awl around Osaka on my bicycle...
He took pitchus of awl of it!
Ah, thank goodness the snake is gone.
When I'm happy, my sunglasses fall down.
but the anime on this morning was so amusing,
Then, are we going to be in a magazine?
Oh, is that right?
Good morning, Tsuyoshi-kun and company!
Hayama, are you in a bad mood about something?
He's got a fever now.
He appears to be gone now. He's not that big a snake at all, is he?
Let's go to work, Rei-kun!
That is unusual, huh?
Hey, it's so dark, it's not turning out.
Aah! Sana-fin! Aah! Sana-fin!
Uh-huh... Yes, okay... Yes...
The office just got a message for you from Sagami-san.
It is so to my credit, Sensei.
This isn't some cheap trick to take the photo away and tear it up.
You don't have to stoop to this rotten sort of work.
Waugh! Something's passing over me!
Yes, then we can beat him to the announcement.
Cooperate with me, sister.
I'll be back tomorrow, Natsumi-chan.
Maybe I'll go to your school tomorrow.
Sana-chan, I just feel so creeped out. I'm afraid to go outside.
That tears it!
How can I be a 6th grade TV personality if I'm afraid of some snake reporter!?
Out of the way, Hayama!
Huh? You're not snakes...
Sana-chan?
You dummy! Those are your underpants!
an8"Things go in an unexpected direction"
That's okay, that's okay.
She died.
"Just like Hayama's family"
Dinosaur?
That's the head.
--So Hayama is a dinosaur freak, huh? --Do you have any cardboard you don't need?
 Crumble, crumble, break the kurumafu bread 
 be sure to add plenty, okay? 
Oh, very nice! Kurosaki-san,
...we saw the family you are making sure to protect.
and regard ourselves as having been bitten by a passing cobra, like Hayama said.
--The salad is done! -- It's almost done! 
an8"We ate the Ofu-rench toast!"
What are we going to do, Sensei!?
he looks like a regular father, but on the inside, he's a pumpkin.
so BOY, take a look my way!
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
Sana-chan, you're even more lively during breaks, huh?
Police rushed in, and the suspect who was arrested at the scene...
...was Oki lsao, age 41.
It's Father Oki!!
After what your father did,
But, Tsuyoshi...
Mm-hmm. Okay, we're leaving now.
Hayama, you saw the news last night, too! That really was a surprise, huh?
Oh, you mean the news yesterday, by any chance?
That might be a little weird.
Weird is fine, as long as he's not bothering anyone.
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Um... um... um...
Heh heh, I'm surprised you even came.
In fact, I feel lucky that they got divorced as soon as they did.
and so Aono is a bad girl, too.
Aono, Big Brother, and Mom have not done anything wrong.
T- to die?
Ah, what if good boys and girls were to imitate what you're doing!?
Oh, crap! What am I doing!?
Hang on, I'm thinking right now.
You want to see him?
If I were to say something here,
Leave me alone, would you!?
but still, if all you ever do is keep it in...
Adults may have their situation, but children have their situations, too!
They may have split up, but the dad is still the dad,
"Those grounds were..."
You've got some pocket change, right?
N- no...
What kind of kids were they?
That's why the old guy snapped like he did.
 Anyhow, we're so relieved now! 
To pick your old man up?
an8"You're not going?"
Don't go getting stuck on the side of the screen!
What's the matter?
Tsuyoshi, you want to go pick up your dad, don't you?
You're sure? You're really sure?
I'll be back later!
Dad...
Terrific! That's terrific, Tsuyoshi-kun!
That's what you say about times like these.
Aah! How embarrassing for the school!
Oh, no doubt about it.
Right now, we even have teachers making it with each other,
By all means, come visit us.
Huh? How did you know?
Tsuyoshi-kun, a moment...
Tanaka-sensei, you shouldn't be saying that.
It's their turn to do it, so they need to do it properly.
Is that what you think, Norio-san?
Were you lying when
That's right. People who are good at it should be the ones who do it.
Like this!
Fine! The boys aren't doing it, either!
Not really.
nothing good will come of it.
Everyone, I'm taking Mitsuya-sensei's side!
and cook three times a day!
I declare an all-out battle with the boys!
This is terrible. If this keeps up,
But the boys-
wearing my hair up please remain quiet.
Be my guest!
And guys, as guys...
I didn't think he had such issues!
Those aren't the kind of "shoes" she means!
Sensei, it's Social Studies...
Everyone else, start playing too!
Aya-chan, what are you doing right now?
Right!
 Build a great nation, Kamakura Shogunate! 
-- And let the boys do the cleaning! 
--Let the boys do it!
This is the boys' fault! Everyone, call Andoh-sensei over!
Don't run in the hall!
and overcome this wall.
That goes for you, too! Ah, Kojima-kun, you're not wearing any underpants!
Nothing beats rice for us Japanese boys, right?
Wow, thanks, Aya-chan!
What!?
Everyone, let's study the spirit of Japan!
Ah, I goofed up.
--What did you say!?
--Hey, boys!
You're charging me money!?
I did it! I got the meat sauce!
We're going to have Tarako spaghetti!
Look out, Andoh-sensei!
Ah! I forgot! They're coming today!
"Child's Toy 33:
along with the ones who are said to be the woild's woist couple,
Wow... they showed us some great drama, huh?
but what about the contest?
--Mitsuya! --and Tanaka...
Our apologies to all his fans.
Hayama, who hasn't appeared much lately.
and acting in dramas is all so good.
Zenjiro... lonely birthday...
Sorry I'm late, everyone. I'm Tobita Mayu.
Yes, that's right.
What? What is it?
Oh, I didn't have time to fix it. Here, as a token of our friendship.
Ah, thank goodness!
How about if we all make handmade presents?
He said "I guess"!
A- Aya-chan...
Her cheeks are starting to turn red.
Tonight, I'm going shopping with Aya-chan and the others for the party.
Not this again. Sana-chan, they can't start unless you're there.
No way. It's not as though we're doing rehearsals yet, right?
Nope!
Oh, yeah! They decided on Kamura Naozumi-kun
Really? That's right, I have to give Naozumi-kun, Mayu-chan,
Terrific!
You're always putting work second.
Um, we once appeared in the same production together.
but we did meet at rehearsal-
Yoo-hoo! Naozumi-kun, long time no see.
But when I have good friends around, it helps me to settle down.
--Well, you are the one with all those books. --flames of envy, Tomomi-chan.
In plain language, we'd call it yakimochi "jealousy".
An invitation to a birthday party for Zenjiro-san.
Tomomi-chan, please come too!
and it says that they are completely incompatible, huh?
Yeah, that's okay! That sounds like it would be funny! I'll do it!
an8"Shorokutai Special: New song, 'Vitamin Love' rehearsal"
You've done it, all right.
Woof!
Oh, she's mad, she's mad.
...after the shooting is finished, how about getting some dinner?
I...
Huh? You two...
with only a moderate burst!
Shut up!!
All this time, I've been working frantically.
while I was reluctant to even spend time going to school,
Oh no, you really are upset at me?
I have a bad habit of always enjoying myself while working and everything else.
She's so silly.
 Oh, my! We are open to everyone! 
 Now we're the middle-aged squad! 
-- You're the only middle-aged one here! 
Kurata-san, there is one thing that you taught me.
"Vitamin Love" Song by Shorokutai
-- You're posing too much, 
-- sparkling love will never come to you. 
Is that Sana-chan's influence?
Not at all...

A crisis comes up for 6th Year 3rd Class' only love-love couple,
Who was it that sent him the present?

Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
who were brought together by a present and easily became close.
And this is Tsuyoshi-kun's younger sister, Aono-chan,
but in return, the remaining problems are your homework.
Don't you dare, Sana-chan!
Up until half a year ago, Tsuyoshi-kun was in love-love with you, Sana-chan.
That's no fun.
Are you sure it wasn't your imagination? Never mind that, let's get going.
It will be done right away, okay?
Oh, did Sugita-san come over?
After all, you got chocolate from Sana-chan last year or whenever, right?
Speaking of yakimochi, there's this isobeyaki shop
Well, I'm going to go over my homework again,
I don't know what to do about this.
I don't know how to handle this. I've got Aya-chan.
Seeing two girls at the same time.
--Tsuyoshi-kun, let's have some fun!
--Eriko-chan, maybe? --Tsuyoshi-kun!
Could I see you a minute, Hayama?
He had a weird habit of getting stuck on them
an8"Ignore"
Say then, are you saying
Quite a spectacle.
Aya-chan!
I'm sorry, Aya-chan.
Let's see... perhaps a paid vacation.
This has been "Zenjiro's Get the Goil Show"! See you again next week!
What is this, your car, Sana-chan?
As it turns out...
Here goes!
 That's why Sana-chan will do her best-best-best! 
But Sana-chan, even if you drive this girl away from him this time,
Good for you, Rei-kun!
Aya-chan...
I'm sorry, Aya-chan!
Big Brother, what's wrong?
--I have a package for you. --Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! A package! Yay!
together with Aya-chan!
You're late, Tsuyoshi-kun...
Oh, Aya-chan...
--Go tell her "good morning"! Come on, come on! --I can't... I couldn't...
Oh, is that so?
Aya-chan...
and give them to you as presents, Tsuyoshi-kun.
You're not at all fine!

 are able to cure lovesickness! 
 Choina-sa no choina-sa no choina-sa no sa! 
Mama, Rei-kun and I are on our way to Kusatsu hot springs for winter vacation.
then when it happens,
It's Katagiri-san!
Welcome, Sana-chan.
I'm sliding! I'm sliding! Gleam!
This sure does seem like a long-established inn, huh Sensei?
That hot spring water is cooled a little bit here,
Now go ahead and have a bath!
This water is terrific!
Family trip!
Does that mean Hayama is here, too?
Yo.
We got a call from the mistress here, saying she'd only charge us half price,
Is that right?
to please lead us in a toast...
All right, if I may be so bold...
You can go skiing in Kusatsu. Skiing is so delightful.
but Kurata Inn has 300 years' worth of history.
If you don't have a successor, it doesn't make any difference.
Just turn Kurata Inn entirely over to me, Kunisada Chukichi,
Must be a dog.
T- that was a threat just now, right? It was, right? What do we do?
This is starting to sound like a period drama.
But... but you heard what he was saying!
I... I am Sana-chan's betrothed!
So my daughter, Natsumi, says to me "Why not? Let's go!"
Oh, yeah. My son has recently taken up karate.
Today is the day you give me a clear answer, Mistress!
I won't allow Kurata Inn to be turned over to you guys!
but I can't very well do so right now, either...
Enough of this insolence! Let them have it!
Anyone who wants to stay here, feel free.
What have you been reading so intently all this time?
Mistress! Mistress!
Just a minute!
That's a pretty underhanded thing to do!
I've been waiting for an answer.
...for two.
...for two.

Even so, right now, when I'm around him, I'm relaxed for some reason.
"Safety first"
Nice! Nice!
--that feeling that Christmas is almost here swells up inside! --I appreciate you going to all that trouble. Thank you so much.
Yeah! Yeah! Let's do that! Let's do that!
Sensei...
Do you have anyone to go out with?
--Sana-chan! --You're married?
Sorry. I'm glad you asked me, but I'm throwing a party at my house.
Hayama's and mine.
Akito-kun!
A present is something you have to put your whole heart into when choosing!
He's coming this way! What do we do? What do we do? What do we do, Akito-kun?
Are you seeing Sana-chan?
and bungee jumping,
I've started taking karate.
What?
Huh? You're asking if there can be such a fight?
Will this make it a three-way battle!?
Yes, but...
--Can't you do something? --Mm-mm, I'm not listening.
What an utterly weird American.
I know! I'll make myself look like Sana-chan!
--kissing scenes are just part of the job, aren't they? --Sana-chan...
A kiss, huh?
Ohh...
Have you ever been kissed?
She seems to be enjoying herself.
Huh, Akito-?
Sana-chan doesn't get it at all.
--Sana-chan! --She got away!
I thought I wouldn't have a problem with it, since it was a kiss for work,
O- on the cheek, huh?
You didn't make sure to check again, did you?
What do you want, calling me out here?
so BOY, take a look my way!
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
G- good morning, Sana-chan.
Must be hard playing the lead role.
--Yay! Naozumi-kun is coming, coming, coming! --Empty-empty handed-handed, here he is.
--Um, it's about time we started class. --The bura-bura alien is here. Empty-empty handed-handed, here he is.
Then Kamura Naozumi suddenly showed up.
H- have I guessed right, Hayama?
Akito-kun, you don't have to stress so much over this!
You're good at that, huh?
Whatever.
Try thinking of something that made you happy when you got it.
You told me your father bought it for you, didn't he?
What company do you work for, anyway?
But I'll be here on the 25th.
Father has been strange lately.
Check!
this one is real!
Asako...
Go on, take it. Go on, go on.
He said you were really at a loss.
Thanks.
Anything would have been fine. I should have bought her something.
Is that so? There's nothing left?
No, sorry to trouble you.
an8"Just then, Zenjiro-san was..."
What's that?
I- it seems like I've hoid them someplace befo-uh-
It can't be! You can't be Sumire-chan, right?
Let's limbo! Holy night special!
This isn't right! This can't be Christmas!
 To those who are happy, and those who are sad, 
 tonight we sing to you "Merry Christmas." 
I got a phone call from Naozumi-kun.
Ah, this is unusual! A stray dog!
but instead, it's how she just can't leave a lonesome, stray dog alone.
All right! Sana took command of Christmas!
--Sana-chan is dense. You have to clearly tell her, or it won't get through to her. --A bedpan? A butt? A belly-button? A big salamander?
Sometimes, Hayama's eyes can paralyze others...
Hey! Who the hell are you guys!?
That's what you say about times like these.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
mquick-changes into a merry-go-round...
"Kodomo no Omocha "
it's time to get out of there!
I always feel Relax,
they're all nice!
He doesn't have anything to do with the story, so we can leave him out.
Geez, it's unforgivable for people to be so dumb!
What are you doing!?
You're worried about something, huh?
H- hey...
You... think so...?
By the way, Onda-san, about Sensei's current book...
I- it's...?
while we're at work, I've got...
when this book comes out, then what exactly--?
Snap to, would you?
Yeah, a happy circle? How so?
What are you laughing at?
You don't, by any chance, want to laugh, too, do you?
All I did was give everyone a little nudge.
It's amazing that you don't think to yourself,
Y- you're sure enjoying yourself.
-- What fun!  --I guess I was wrong after all about her cheerfulness being an act.
--I was so happy to see Hayama smile for the first time, --Smile, Hayama! Come on! Come on!
We sure are amazing, aren't we?
I feel like the gloominess in my heart has cleared up.
How cute! How cute! I know...!
This week's Tanuki!
I'm back!
Thanks!
Okay!
Is that so? Nice work.
I'm going to forget about it for a while.
--Then there's rehearsals for the play we're putting on at Komawari. --Tom!
--Sana-chan! Let go! --Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom!
The commercials I shot last month all started appearing on TV,
Wash! Wash! One, two, four! Ah! Too much came off!
So what about it?
What, is Kamura-kun that popular?
and when you sat down on a chair, you wouldn't know how you should sit.
You're always doing things you don't think out, so you're always--
Huh? That was kind of bitter. Did something bad happen, Akito-kun?
I promised her she could a long time ago, so there's nothing I can do about it.
an8"The new novel by Kurata Misako 'My Daughter and I' Now taking preorders"
Whatever!
Still, if I ever start feeling like I want to cry...
Twirl! Twirl! Twirl!
That's how we hafta portray these poor roaches that get extoiminated.
Poor things...
So shua, you get to wear a cute outfit, while we get to be roaches...
Wait up!
--Sorry we're late. --Oh, I'm starting to get dizzy.
--I am a genius at this, after all! --He's the boy who was in that one recent drama,
Heal-Band.
Okay, job well done!
They said you can keep this. Here.
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
...quite nice, maybe.
--I'm the only one in the whole class who is unaffected. --you stay in your seats!
Sana-chan is leaving early again today, huh?
She didn't laugh.
You'll pay for this, Haya-moth!
So, you're not going with her?
No... I couldn't take that!
Apparently, it was around here that Mama was sprinkled with Haya-moth's scales.
And a zebra-moth...
Amazing, Sana-chan! You got the whole flock at once!
Don't sell us short! Don't sell us short!
What are you doing in something like this?
As punishment, I've been turned into a moth, and locked up inside here.
You poor thing.
I'm free!
They're sticking to me! The scales are sticking to me!
Hi there, I'm Sana-moth.
L- like this?
When you get good at it, you can even do stuff like this.
Come down here! I'm going to spank you until you can't scatter any more scales!
I didn't want to take on this form, either.
If I... If I wasn't the princess...
I'm sorry, Haya-moth!
Why don't you go tell everyone in the kingdom?
"Back against the wall."
an8"Sana-chan's drawing song"
 It's time for gym, so bring out the vaulting boxes. 
 And now we've drawn Sana-chan! 
"Hayama, this time, you're going to fight my dinosaur!" "That's fighting dirty."
That's right! This is no time to be putting on this sort of screwy anime!
What is this!? What's going on!?
"Seized"
I've been waiting for an answer.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...up to now, just for today,
...for two.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 40, a tale of farewell in the rain,
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
What are you doing?
--just as I was breathing easy... --A present?
But before I had a chance to think, the Kurata household was in big trouble!
But that means that all of your property will be seized, right?
"Doesn't it?"
This is no time to be explaining things in song.
Whoa, for having an expressionless face, that was quite a dramatic touch.
I would wait for her in front of the statue of Saigo Takamori, in Ueno Park.
That is the way a date should be.
You have a severe personality, where everything is measured with a square rule.
This, despite having such a round face.
You too.
We'll be able to see each other again soon, right?
What about asking the folks back home in Kusatsu if they could help out somehow?
Sana! We'll climb our way out of here to reach for tomorrow's stars!
Which one? Mama, which one?
"Sana-chan sings"
My name is Kurata, and we just moved in here today.
Which is why you should get stirred up.
On New Year's Eve, we eat soba noodles, soba noodles!
Mm-hmm. It came out in the weeklies.
I- is that true, Sana-chan? Why did that happen? Aah, poor Sana-chan!
Yep.
An eraser, shaped like a turd?
Y- yeah.
Say, we should give her something too, shouldn't we?
pocket tissues, animal picture books, green turtles...
I see...
Toin it ovuh! Toin it ovuh!
Do some exercise.
We got a lot of stuff, huh?
Sana-chan!
 It's time for gym, so bring out the vaulting boxes. 
Let's see... perhaps a paid vacation.
If there's anything I can do for you, feel free to ask.
to make sure you weren't having any problems, so that's why I'm here.
with far more urgent needs than we have. We are not all that badly off.
However, in your present circumstances, you must have some expenses, right?
We will just thank you for the sentiment.
Oh, I slept so well.
She's wearing it.
Yo.
Ah! I forgot! I left it inside there!
Sana-chan wouldn't be going to her old house, would she?
What's going on here, exactly?
"Ooh-ooh" Didn't I look like a monkey?
Well, after all, it does represent your feelings, Hayama.
Hayama...
Hey, you! This place is off-limits!
I might not have been able to say goodbye to everything.
I may have changed houses, but as much as before- mm-mm,
So at this point now, yeah at this point now,
Sing-ken-ken ken-ken, Tidak apa-apa
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
I always feel Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
The Kurata household... has gone bankrupt.
Ah, what on earth am I supposed to do?
Rei-kun, the tea, the tea!
Ah! You stole my omelet roll!
Oh, that's right!
an8"Are you serious?"
That's right.
Whenever I ask about the reasons for the cancellations,
Don't tell me that!
Sagami-san, isn't it?
However, the situation is a little bit different now, is it not?
For the sake of Sana-chan's future, would you be the one to suggest it to her?
I doubt you're going to find work so easily.
I wonder what they're talking about. They seem to be on fairly good terms.
an8"Tsu-san dug his own boketsu"
--Using underhanded tricks to take away Sana-chan's work to get her to join them? --Now, now, easy, easy...
Rei-kun, with that kind of attitude,
All right, times like this call for... this!
an8"The Narrow Path of Enka"
 Ah, such is our secret meeting 
Rei-kun, it's morning! Let's eat!
Hey, Rei-kun! I made a whole bunch of rice!
Ma'am, three croquettes, please!
Kurata Sana-chan, right?
and then add two handles.
Huh? "Dreaming Pro"? President, Yumezono Matata-ta-ta-ta-ta
Speaking of Sagami-chan, are you sure this is best for him?
If you keep Sagami-san restricted like this,
Really?
Huh? What are you saying? I don't understand.
His Burutcha...
Rei-kun...
He came back!
After all, I don't have any work, so I was thinking of joining Drea-Pro or somewhere.
I'm right here!
Whoa! That's dangerous, mister!
Rei-kun...
U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI
so just keep going unlike this,
that it's a drama on at 3:00 in the morning that no one will see.
a tale of "oops, I forgot to write my essay!"
The Delirious Nick-of-Time Deadline
"Kodomo no Omocha"
Were you surprised?
Yes, I was.
Yeah.
Get this. You know how the way all of my work was suddenly cancelled...
Which is to say, it's just a bit part.
Composition...
Essay?
That's it.
Ordinarily, I wouldn't be.
Hey! You're not shooting me!
Editor-in-Chief, we're the ones who requested Kurata Sana to write for us.
It's dirty!
"Even after I become an aunt, or a grandma,
That's right! I have the essay I wrote then!
All right! Let's get cracking!
What!?
Sana-chan has gone faceless from shock.
I don't think he'll let you.
If you're that insistent about Kurata Sana's book,
We're raking it in just by being alive.
Sana-chan! Hello, are you awake, Sana-chan? Hey, Sana-chan!
without us having to obstruct her.
Punishing hammer!
W- was that a ghost? Was that a ghost?
Sometimes irrational things happen in this anime...
Sana-chan, hang in there. We're behind you!
So am I.
Aya-chan, thank you. All right, back to writing!
Doesn't it wear you out?
so that's why you're writing too, Sana-chan.
That's in pretty poor taste.
But then, if we did that,
we would be stooping to the same level as Drea-Pro's president.
She said her deadline was tomorrow morning, right?
I think it's working...
It's finished!
Stop, Mr. Onda.
Bye Bye Bye Bye
KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI
"Kodomo no Omocha"
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
My Aoki award-winning novelist Mama, and her chipmunk, Maro-chan.
My chauffeur, manager, and ex-pimp, Rei-kun.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend, I suppose.
What a disgracefuloose girl I am!
Gojo-san said he would bring her home now. Isn't that great?
Usually, you release doves when you do that, right?
You're going to be steeped in scandal.
"That's all for Drea-Pro's evil schemes for today."
Surprised you?
Okay, out! 20 minute break.
In middle school?
an8"Guidance"
That's okay. I'll do what I need to by myself.
that has been set up for a year now.
 I'll dance on the dresser for Guidance. 
an8"Good little children should be asleep"
What do you want!?
I would like to discuss the relief sculpture for graduation.
Please think about this seriously.
Sana-chan, you're late.
so she asked me to accompany you.
There are a number of obstacles unique to the entertainment world,
Unless she produces results, that's not good enough!
W- what was that?
You're going to test for Kaimei Middle School, right?
I don't know.
Mom!
You okay?
Shinichi-san!
Let's go have some fun.
your advancement to Jinbo Middle School will be in jeopardy.
He's a feisty old codger! He's so old, Sana-chan,
When we press our bodies together like this?
You spread it around to everyone!
Not really.
Nothing going on here.
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
When you sing this song, your worries will go
you can laugh it away, excuse me, I must be going.
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Once your lips touch, you can't change your mind.
If you think calmly about it for a minute
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 44,
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
it's time to get out of there!
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
My handsome manager, Rei-kun.
Damn! It hurts!
Sushi!?
there must have been something that happened between those two.
 and girls have roads that they go down. 
 You can't say that! You can't say that! Not without sauce! 
Mama is trying this... this... this hard to work, and you're bothering me!
an8"What happened between you and Gomi?"
Sana-chan, we watched it!
--Ew, ugh! Ew, ugh! Ew, ugh! --and just a little bit timid...
Ow!
Can't you even solve those problems?
Yes.
it'll be impossible for you to get into Kaimei Middle.
Don't you think Jinbo Middle would be better for you?
How come?
Being all alone is... no fun!
Heh heh, those were the days.
Hey! That's shoplifting!
What the?
--I heard Hayama-san was caught shoplifting! --Have you heard?
No, I didn't.
My word! How dare he say that so brazenly and bald-facedly!
...by that boy Hayama-kun in your class. How disturbing.
I- I don't know!
It wasn't Hayama-san... It wasn't Hayama-san who ratted on me!
What went on? Tell me plainly everything that happened, Hayama.
I... have to tell Hayama-san...
You have a telephone call from your son.
We have already been over to offer our apologies to the store owner.
I'm...
--This is intolerable! --This is intolerable!
--!ydnah si sihT
This is handy!
Gomi-kun has stopped coming to school.
We're hard up now.
you won't be able to go to Jinbo Middle, right?
You bastards! Stop messing with us!
Hey! No fighting!
I will not allow any alarming situations!
--Love-love believe! --Love-love believe!
When you sing this song, your worries will go
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
Gwaenchansseumnida, kwenchanaym
But then, there's one class that's the most indifferent to Valentine's Day
Is this bunch capable of celebrating Valentine's Day?
"Kodomo no Omocha"
it's time to get out of there!
I always feel Relax,
-- any drive-by chocolating.  --Ah, Sana-chan, is that valentine's chocolate?
Huh? But you must have been watching something interesting, right?
My own little brother is in kindergarten, and he'll get ten of them.
Good morning!
--Discontinued!?
Take it! Take it! Take some chocolate!
I'd like to pound his face.
I don't have any chocolate.
Well, I've got a drama taping with my boyfriend now, so bye-bye!
I'm sure that it isn't true love! You just haven't realized it yet!
Hey, isn't he here yet?
We can't seem to reach him.
Shooting on the drama has already started, Take-chan!
No, no, that's not what they mean. Apparently, he's prone to absenteeism.
I'm going to go look for Take-chan!
Come on, whoosh off of here at the next station, and go back with Sana-chan!
This train goes all the way to the ocean.
Take-chan...
Look, Sagami-chan, I can't keep the staff waiting any longer.
But...
Go on, eat, eat! There's as much as you want!
Long ago...
And yet...
The one who was so very dear to me.
Here it comes! Here it comes!
I will go back!!
 Since they're alive, lots of things happen to them! 
Hey! Hisae-chan!
Huh? Did you just hide something?
Huh? I thought you had given up random acts of chocolate.
an8"Valentines can be bittersweet"
But it makes me so happy!
and guys who look like it doesn't matter to them.
I've got a bad feeling.
"Gnileef dab a tog evi."
I've got a bad feeling.
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
When you sing this song, your worries will go
When you sing this song, your worries will go
What is it this time?
Take-chan, help me.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Go on, take it away, you thief!
Oh, but I'm not at all worried about it now.
She acts weird at home, too.
But maybe that makes her really cool!
Mami-chan...
No! I can't go to work like this! Do a U-turn, or I'll jump off!
This is dangerous! All right! All right!
 It was myself, too-la-loo-la-loo. 
Anyhow, I've got some work in a movie tomorrow.
Sana-chan didn't want to write about what Akito-kun did in the past,
an8"What about Mami-chan?"
an8"Babbit's drawing song"
I wonder why it is...
--Just a little bit... and if I could, forever... --The meat here is lousy, huh?
Even I...
All right! My daughter at the top of the rankings is a dream no longer!
Yatsugatake...
Would you care for a bento?
Hey.
There's something that's gotten me a bit down, you see...
Who is that pushing its button?
in Nagano Prefecture.
Maybe I'll stay here with you, Take-chan, for the rest of my life.
Together forever with Take-chan... forever...
Uh-oh, time for work.
If we're going to stay here for the rest of our lives,
I'm sorry to make you have to do that.
Thanks.
I'm going to talk to Mami-chan, and tell her exactly what I feel. Mm-hmm, I've got to.
When I thought that you had disappeared because of me, Sana-chan, I was so sad...
I'm sorry.
Take-chan... Take-chan... It went okay! Take-chan, everything's all right!
Ah, that was a suspenseful one, huh?
Ah! What!?
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
so resolve when to give up
KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI
It's all crazy over there,
a tale of a confrontation between Take-chan and Hayama,
My beloved Mama is a famous novelist, who has even won the Aoki Laureate Prize,
The mysterious white bat straight man.
Mami-chan was really looking forward to reading the essay,
What do I do? What do I do?
There's something that's gotten me a bit down, you see...
You're going to go back, all on your own.
Take-chan...
so please leave, remember?
Actually, construction has fallen behind,
Oh, no! I'm going to be tardy! This is bad! This is bad!
If you don't have anywhere else to go... wanna come over?
You're reading too much into it.
Can I come stay over at your place tonight, Take-chan?
I'm kind of homeless right now, and all.
Cut! Okay! That was a good one, Take-san.
Sana-chan, Sana-chan...
Pardon the intrusion!
Ah, today was a full day of work, huh?
Do you have to do this every day!?
And the inauguration party is going to be held at Gojo-san's place!
But I didn't even beg you...
water comes splashing down from it.
Get two cups ready,
Let's draw one more arrow.
Take-chan, never mind the kusudama, where's the meat!?
Meat!
And so, the fan club was dissolved after three hours.
We got out of that apartment safely, then? Thank goodness!
It did kind of seem like it, but then it also seems completely different...
They're like...
I see... So Gojo-san lived here up until thirteen years ago, then?
"And so, Misako-san returns home"
Sensei!
Yes, the whole time.
This will not do.
Agreed.
Watch in front of you when you're driving!
A new home is so nice! It's all shiny! Everywhere you look, it's all shiny!
Well, Take-chan, make sure you eat well.
Surprised you?
Bye Bye Bye
it's all "waah!" over here,
so just keep going unlike this,
Bye Bye Bye Bye
We met by chance when he was playing the role of my father in a drama.
When I looked into his warm eyes, my whole body immediately felt lighter.
"Father, You Are My Father"
and for an American feeling, Texas!
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
I mean, my insides were feeling all tight and stiff, you know?
When I thought about spending the rest of my life with you, Take-chan,
that's what suddenly happened.
Back when I ran away before, I couldn't come back on my own.
So... this is my new room?
I will contact you once I have final confirmation.
Heh heh heh, thanks to Take-chan's great style.
Sana-chan, you're so forgetful, so I'll set your timer, okay?
That dummy has the nerve to call me forgetful!? That jerk!
His unaffected style is something uniquely his.
That was in bad taste.
Ups-a-daisy...
He suddenly disappeared, without even saying goodbye.
That's enough. It's all in the past for you now.
Shimura-san, make some yummy food for him, okay?
Yes, you are waiting, aren't you?
Gojo-san...
Thank you, Sana-chan.
Okay, I'll be over in the next room. Good night, Take-chan.
But should I tell those two?
Here's your breakfast!
Yes, Mother.
Woof!
--Wow, watching Sana-chan --Zenjiro-sensei, you're too candid.
an8"This guy"
Okay, we're going to take it now. Take a deep breath.
If you don't mind, could I get your phone number?
That's what we call "hitting on someone"!
Yeah, really?
Take-chan, you're growing young again.
Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy! Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy!
Sensei...
with what little remaining time the two of them have together.
Okay, if you say so, Sensei.
Good luck. I'm looking forward to it.
Ah, I can't take listening to any more of this, so let's get started.
Dad!
Cut!
Take-chan! Take-chan! Take-chan!
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
and the whole earth is spinning the wrong way.
Cu: you tried your MECHA-KUCHA best,
No... not yet...
Not yet! You can't die yet!
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
I always feel Relax,
You don't mean...
It's better for both me, who absolutely adores fried shrimp,
I don't have any other secrets.
I heard it was on the news at the time.
But Mama has written an essay about that, and it's about to go on sale.
What!?
Oh, so you do indeed like me, huh? I get it! You're one of my fans!
I'm a child who shares the same past as you.
Hold on... Kamura...?
 Thinking about it won't do any good! 
That's okay.
All right?!
The troupe is putting on a stage production today.
Hold on, now. Pitch-uhs? Oh my, what is a poison to do in this position?
Yeah, is that right? What is Sana-chan like at school?
L- let's see... She's been getting on well with Hayama lately, huh?
The one who's not the kind-looking boy waving hello.
Kissed him!?
You're kidding me...
Oh, I'm so nervous! A nervous summer! A Japanese summer!
Man, am I nervous, nervous! What to do? Nervous, nervous...
Mama taught it to me once, when Rei-kun was pretending to be sick.
Sana-chan will be playing the part of this Eucie, right?
Can I sit here?
What's the story with this guy? Huh, Hayama?
--You mean Sunglasses? --Tsuyoshi-kun!
 Invigorating, invigorating, nervousness, fun! 
--What foah!? I'm Zenjiro! --Go home, Mister! --I can't see!
As for her mother...
All I've ever done was try to run away from difficulty and sorrow,
I'm awn!
with a bouquet of flowers.
He's looking for some students. What do you think?
That's silly, Principal.
The play is over now, but the pounding of my heart won't stop.
The mixed response comes quickly,
All I want to know is how Mama feels. And yet, Hayama is acting cold!
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
and for an American feeling, Texas!
an8"What did the doctor and Mama talk about?"
so it will probably be lost in the confusion.
I wonder if it would be okay if I stayed until Take-chan opens his eyes.
"This Is Our Last Scene Together"
Wow, everyone is troubled, huh?

the graduation ceremony is nearly here.
Sensei was thinking that we could all create a monument
--made from the shapes of our faces. --Sana-chan stayed home again today, huh?
--Nothing else would leave a greater reminder of who you are. --What could have happened to Sana-chan,
Sana-chan, you should really eat at least a little bit.
I know you made it for me, but my appetite seems to have gotten lost.
If you're leaving that, can I have it?
Haven't you noticed?
That was mean, Take-chan! I thought you were really dead!
That barbecue was fun, huh?
Ah, it's snowing.
I know. If I die too, I can see Take-chan-
Don't dance in the car!
--and Osakan puhformuhs' front teeth that stick out too far are their lives. --Sana-chan, wait up.
You're being a pest!
Ah! Gonda-san! Be strong!
What about it!?
Sana-chan!
Having them talk about you like that, Take-chan,
All right, let's use that super-shaking vibrating machine!
It's a Burutcha!

--How are we going to get

I want us to stay like this always. Always. Always.
--This is our chance! --Hey, this looks like trouble.
Mister! Akito-kun... Akito-kun is gone! He must have fallen out of the truck!
What about Sana-chan?
Babbit has arrived! Or whatever...
There's no telling when this thing is going to fall as it is!
What are you talking about?
It proves that I'm alive.
Now, what's going on here!?
--Is that right? --It's Sana-chan!
Take-chan... all of these...
Take-chan, isn't this great? I'm not the only one who remembers you, Take-chan...
...who knows that you lived a full life, Take-chan...
Welcome home, Sana.
There you go! She's super-gifted!

We don't have much time, so how about we get started?
Of course. It must sting, huh?
What's with you? Don't get all worked up over something like this.
Y- you dirty letch!
I thought Hayama-kun was on pretty good terms with Sana-chan,
Hayama, are you...
You can't do what you can't do.
Right, right.
Hayama, why did you go back to being a bad person!?
You dummy, dummy, dummy! I'm a dummy-dummy for believing in you, too!
Let me see that picture!
It doesn't matter what it is,

Awl right, it's ovuh!
Sure enough, it's this one.
I know this is sudden, but here's a Sana-chan drawing song.

Ok, then I'll just take a picture of your upper half.
Shinohara Tomoe-chan!
Today, I became a middle school student... Yes, yes...
Good morning, Sana-chan!
Ugly.
There's no way you can understand how I feel.
I don't wanna explain it again.
Class 1.
Really? Me too.
Excuse me, please find the differences between the two. I'll give you 15 seconds.
You want to see what I can do? Is the way I talk really that strange?
You're useless! And you call yourselves middle school students?
You two, what makes you so much better than others?
Pointing and laughing at people behind their back is so rude!
Don't try to talk like me!
I get it.
How can it be? I have be on a cooking show. They called me Little Diner Sana!
I thought so. Hayama.
Hmm... Hayama?
Tsuyoshi-kun, don't talk. Aya-chan, what's going on?
He must come from another elementary school.
I think it's because of his moves that the opponent is angrier.
Hey bushy eyebrows and no eyelashes...
Hey, screen's fuzzy and dreamy all of a sudden...
This week's thick-eye browed, nosebleed kid.
This is the first time I made someone's nose bleed. I have mixed feelings.
Hey, why are you sleeping on the bed?
Hayama, did you make any friends in your class?
Will something change between us?
Now that we're middle school students, what will change between us?
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you!

Mess up!
Yeah, that's true.
Actually... I've already had my first kiss!
Back then I had a life plan.
Elementary school graduation, Takaishi tells me he likes me.
Fuka-chan is really, really mad.
No way!
Who cares, just come.
Are you trying to fool me?
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?!
The competition was really high. This decision is really good.
I'm such a great manager!
Yeah. Well, it's been decided!
You're a failure at being a woman!
What your name is, what does that have to do with anything?
We'll stop right here. Time to go to class!
You're Hayama Akito, right?
He doesn't usually say things like this!
I hoped you wouldn't cause problems...
Hayama-kun is really scary.
True, but also cool.
You're here... eating curry and acting like you're stupid.
What is it?
There were these gold and silver paints that I really treasured.
...I didn't use them and I packed them very carefully...
What do you mean?
Ice cream.
Uh... yeah... I'm alright.
That's right! That's what you should do!
Alright, Fuka! Start doing exercises!
Feels good.
I screwed up my commentary again.
I heard you! I heard you!
Hey, hey, hey...
Asako-san, I didn't know you were going to be in this movie.
That's not it, but you grew up.

What's so interesting about Caterpillar Hayama? I don't get it.
Telling me means Sana has an objection to this.
But Fuka grew up in Osaka where comedy originated.
Even the deadpanned face of Hayama can't get by her unnoticed.
Class 1 and Class 8 keeps Akito-kun and Sana-chan far apart.
Hayama-kun, but can you take a picture for us?
Oh yeah, tell Sana-chan to come over.
Where's Sana-chan's bus 8?
Take a photo with Sana-chan...
Listen to your teacher's words, junior high...

What do you mean?
I don't know...
Being nice to someone I don't like isn't truly being nice.
The right part of my body is getting a weird electric shock.
Now that we're here, what does he want to do?
So Hayama only wanted to show you some scenery?
You're weird! Taking a toy out like that!
So that's the story... Farewell!

Well, I haven't read the script yet but...
I can only win using my acting skills.
The movie... after it starts filming...
You have to get ready.
I think you should clear everything up.
You should tell her before she leaves.
...and she will be with Naozumi-kun all the time.
I'm so embarrassed!
Akito, just talking big is not enough.
The test to go up one level is next week so I have special practice.

It's also strange putting it in the refrigerator.
What's your opinion of him, Sana-chan?
This is embarrassing.
Kurumi-san!
This director's really tough, luckily I was already prepared for it.
Good work.
Is the director still there?
Did he say anything?
But... but... but he's totally different from Rei-kun!
I don't understand him.
Of course, I agree with you, it's because of this.
Even though it's small, you still should wear a bra.
Ok!

Jeez... I'm so confused about everything.
...he looked depressed...
...because I'm a gentleman!
The taping of the show... we haven't been there for a while.
Are you alright? Don't force it. It's okay to rest, we can go another time.
Work! Work! Let's work!
Something unbelievable!
Why is this so dense?
Naozumi-kun really gives me nothing but unconditional tenderness.
...maybe I should be together with Naozumi-kun...
Ah? Never mind!
Okay.
I wasn't joking!
This week's Sana-chan.
Well... Really?
You mean his "certificate"??!
Welcome!
Wow, what a vicious woman!
...and I don't want him to know my feelings!
Naozumi-kun didn't consider her feelings at all!
But I don't know her at all...
So this is your true face, Naozumi-kun?
That's right... you're right.
Yeah.
Let's not dwell on this! I'm gonna take gym seriously!
Sana-chan, here comes the ball!
Yeah, I feel some pain. Can I rest here a while?
I see! Then I won't bother you...
That hurts! Who put that there?
Cuz your heart will be carefree,

My name is Kurata Sana, first year junior high school student.
You've gone too far!
I said don't joke around with me!
Why are you so mad? I only said it because you wanted me to tell you the truth!
But... I just never said it.
If you were normal, you would've understood.
Hayama already has Fuka, I should never have said anything... about the truth...
Hey, hey, but why? What happened to DrePro?
Sana.
Although I don't know what made you change your mind,
Of course!
Uh oh. Time to escape!
- Mama! - Sensei!
I'll feel so lonely...
Hmm... Naozumi-kun looks good in this outfit.
I'm going to concentrate on my acting career.
...during the premiere of "Water Palace", I'm going to go onstage and say hi to my fans!
What's wrong, Zenjiro sensei?
Let's begin the class.
Hurry up! Need to make it to the next call! Hurry! Hurry!
I was thinking, maybe it wasn't so bad after all.
Don't you think he's gotten bigger lately?
There's nothing we can do about you, Hayama...
That hurts!
It's Sana-chan.
Hey, Fuka-chan... does Sana-chan still come to school sometimes?
Mmm. Yeah. But even if she comes she's always almost late.
Really? That means we probably won't see much of her in the future.
Tsuyoshi...
Oh yeah, Akito. Here, before I forget again.
Bye-bye, Hayama.

I'm trapped! This is a nightmare!
I can't take it anymore. I'm in a lot of pain.
Huh?
Who?
Akito-kun...
Really!
I told you not to mention her again.
There's some curry there.
From now on...
Do you want to go watch Sana's movie tomorrow?
Even though you're going out with someone else.
Great! Sana-chan's name came out before Naozumi-kun's.
I told you, Naozumi, she won't lose to you in acting.
Time's up.
Pretty.
You look different from before.
What's "ecnetnes desrever gnitseretni"?
Mr. Gary Hamilton is the New York Broadway King!
Must be candid camera.
It's one of those shows where they trick you and film your reactions.
Look into my eyes... does it look like I'm lying?
One's also been sent home.
Maeda-san! Sagami-san!
I believe everyone else will love it too.
Everyone?
Really?
Water Palace was the greatest.
Really?
It's the real thing.
You've influenced me from the very beginning...
That's why... I don't want to see you depressed...
This is unbelievable, I'm going to say goodbye to Sana-chan today!
Sensei, you too... even though you keep being dumped by women...
Everyone was waiting for you to come back to school...

We made it to New York, huh?
Actually I was already here a couple of times.
The guidebook says if you're not careful in New York all your luggage will be stolen.
If a girl goes out at night alone in New York, there's definitely going to be danger.
Mr. Mackvakiavan?
Is that the Statue of Liberty?
I can't move, Sana-chan.
Brooklyn! Brooklyn! Manhattan!
Could this possibly be...
This is our weekly ball.
Come this way please.
- Mysterious white Bat... - Babbit!
Come on?
I guess you're supposed to feel like that when you're enjoying a party.
Oh this is American Style, it is a bit different.
How do you do?
Yeah, I thought I heard that name before.
So she's really great, isn't she?
This is the training room.
You two look good together. You're lovers?
- Just good friends. - Yeah.
From here on are Maeda-sama, Sagami-sama, and Kamura-sama's rooms.
Goodnight then.
Alright then me too, goodnight.
Hmm?
Goodnight, Naozumi-kun.
Because in my family we have a servant and her name is Shimura-san.
Ah, it's nothing.
Usiarumo what is it?
...and she's complete!
In America, the unit of measurement more frequently used is the pound not the kilogram.
No, Rei-kun, it was already 10 pounds less.
Even I don't know when the weights were added.
Maybe it's the time difference.
This way, Sana-chan!
What is with him...?
How dare you say that after hiding in the corner eating.
Do you have to be like this?
Rei-kun, call an ambulance!
If I had checked everything carefully this wouldn't have happened.
It's better that we don't attract attention.
Alright then I'll go back to my room.
Sana-chan...

My manager and driver, Rei-kun. But when he was in New York he didn't like cars.
Yup. It appeared.
What's wrong with everybody? You look like you've seen a ghost.
You know about it, Ramsy-san?
Well... that is actually...
Did everyone sleep well last night?
Where? Hollywood?
Don't be late for the 10 o'clock appointment, okay?
On the other hand, Sana-chan and Naozumi-kun depart together to attend their first class!
Ladies first.
Anything can happen in New York!
Tires burst in Japan too.
Sana-chan... Sana-chan!
Aw, come on. Michelle's such a joker.
I am Kurata Sana!
Sana-chan!
- Huh? - Now? Right here?
Dance, dance, dance, dance!
Twirl twirl twirl twirl...
Sana-chan! Are you okay?
...and there it is, Sana-chan's done!
Jump, jump... Hey! Hey! hey!
Hey? Hello? Excuse me? Doctor hey hey?
Wait a minute, what did you mean?!
We came here because of the musical, not just for ourselves.
If I should see them?
Eh? What? You want to carry me? No need...
No, I've just been horribly trained by Michelle-san.
She said my dancing experience is too little and my stamina isn't enough.
If it's two people, then we could work hard together, right?
Has anything been stolen?
...but maybe she's the ghost Sana-chan saw last night.
But she had legs so she couldn't be a ghost anyway.
"Get out! Go back to Japan!"

"Yahoo Sana" but one of them said it was only because of her mother's influence.
Yes, I appreciate it.
If it is all right with you,
for two or three days would be better, under the circumstances.
Apparently, she's only worried about how her mom is feeling.
Oh, no! What do I do!?
Oh, are you still in here?
Wow, this is your mother? How pretty!
Nice going, Father Hayama.
How cute!
You're right!
Hayama, you really do have a mole right here, huh?
I have them, too. I was born with three huge birthmarks, all in a row.
Nope, nope. We're not telling you, Akito.
--Right! --Right!
--Your ass? --Bingo! --Bingo!
It sure is loud in here. What are you talking about?
I said don't tell anyone!
I sure am hungry. Want to eat something?
--Ramen! --Ramen!
Yeah, huh?
Disguise! Indian!
I get carried away and babble a bunch of stuff that I shouldn't have,
--Oh, it's moving! --What's going on?
--A giraffe? That's a giraffe! --Just a minute!
She's falling!
I thought it was a giraffe.
Okay then, everyone, good evening.
--Good evening...
I found it!
When you get to be an adult, you have to go through a lawt of stuff...
Seriously?
That was good.
Mama overcame that same figure when she was younger, though.
What would I do... if she was planning to turn me over...?
Somehow, I'm not quite following the whole situation,
--Yeah! --Dad!
whenever you get wound up!
--Yes... Yes... Yes, but... Yes... --The press has been reduced quite a bit.
 I'm staying home at the Hayama house! 
This is Sagami. Thank you for looking after Sana-chan.
But I'm sure that Naozumi-kun did it for Sana-chan--
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
This has been the white bat, Babbi-- waahh!

Isn't there a saying that one who's drowning will even eat straw?
That should have been 'one who's drowning will grasp at straws'.
don't you think, Washington-kun?
Sicil, you...
Pleased to meet you, Naozumi.
How could I do such a thing to important guests?
What's this?
Could you be a boy...?
But Mama, you keep saying that but you were never going to let me meet him.

Ever since the first time I saw his picture in Daddy's room, I thought he was very handsome.
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

We ended up running a hundred laps on the roof.
Hey. Staggering around like this, you must be tired.
That's true.
Don't be mad, Brad. I know you're a good person.

Naozumi...
I feel relaxed for the first time since we came to New York.
You're not asleep, are you?
I may be the only one being targeted.
There's something I haven't told you yet, Sana-chan.
Yesterday, a stranger approached me...
How should I know?
But now that we understand each other in this matter, do your best as my partner in the play!
I have tickets to go back to Japan if you still need them.
Sicil...!
The lessons, right?
Putting up with Michelle-san every day.
It's not that easy to find an apartment! We can't stay at the hotel forever!
Yes.
You are...
So that's how it is. I wanted to tell you everything I know anyway. Listen, you are...
"They don't need to see us."
We already know the lines, right?
Let's continue the search!
Ok!
There is a cute girl, let's dance with her!
Fight-o, Rei-kun!
I made it all by myself! It's great, isn't it?
Listen, Naozumi!
No way! Let me go, Brad!
He was mean to Sicil!
Sicil...
I hate you just the same as my mother! I hate you!
Just a little more, and they'll run back to Japan.
What are you doing?
Yes, it does.
You will practice your lines today as well.
You're in the way! Leave us and go back to Japan!

This person's a choreographer of Broadway that I've never seen before, Michelle Hamilton.
Return to Japan at once!
Help!
What are you doing, Brad?
I'm Naozumi's... mother.
On top of that you've come from a far place. I'm really sorry.
I'm really glad you came.
- Perhaps she's one of your fans. - There aren't any in New York!
Hello.
Yes...
You were wearing white baby clothes, smiling while looking at me.
I see...
It's true...
Anyways, read the user's manual carefully.
It calms you down. Perhaps you prefer the trumpet...
Yes... So, room 3025... there it is!
The shop closes at 12 o'clock.
When I was in the city, I was embarrassed about not finding a room.
He said the room next to his was free, it helped me a lot.
It will be done soon, so expect something good.
Where are you going, Brad?
If you have something to say, say it!
Delicious!
Naozumi? Perhaps you didn't like it?
No, I'm sorry. I don't feel like eating.
Something... happened...?
Odoru Burger Shop.
Bernie made them.
You can eat it tomorrow when you want, ok?
You've got a big heart!
I'd like to be dancing more...
You can say that, but I can't find an apartment so fast, and...
Why don't you stay with your friends?
Bernie! We're back!

I thought I may as well listen to what she has to say.
Let's make lot of delicious stuff and surprise Naozumi-kun when he gets back!
Like this, anytime you want to play.
Errr...
Alone, just like before. That's what I've decided.
That's great. I helped stir it!
I can't help it, I'm happy. Right, Naozumi?
Ah, Sana-chan.
Ah, the trumpet? I can't play this well.
New York's night view is pretty, isn't it?
She hugged me, and cried.
But anyway, even though I've met her now, my life will remain the same.
My family is everyone at the Kamura institute.
How long do you plan on staying out here?
Thank you very much, thank you very much!
What's with the scary face?
Everything is so much fun when I am with Naozumi. It makes me so happy!
I know! But I'll go with him to Japan.
Especially after Gary-san left.
Hold on, Brad!

I'm Mizukuchi, Yuko Mizukuchi.
He has a fever right now.
I'm Naozumi's mother.
So it's alright now. I'm going home.
This woman loves to talk!
To tell you the truth, I didn't have any luck before, but now everything's going to change.
What is it?
We met when he came to Japan to work.
If at that time he had stayed with me...
I am so embarrassed.
As long as you're safe, everything's fine.
Maybe I should say 'romantic' or 'idiotic' ...
5, face so red.
So that's settled.
This is how children without any professional ambitions act like, full of trouble.
Where's Naozumi?
Oh yes, Yuko-san is the woman who saved Naozumi-kun.
Sicil.
Yes?
Naozumi, Papa and Mama all hate me.
Other people's children dance on Papa's stage.
He probably wants to return to being as strong as he used to be.
If there comes a time that it isn't enough, we're still here for him, aren't we?
There must be a lot of people who like you.
Just like the way you like Naozumi-kun.
Are you Gary Hamilton?

No, it's alright, I'm too full.
You'll also attend the party, right? Bring lots of pizzas.

Okay, I will go make the worst tasting pizzas.

That means that Sicil is... his younger sister!
Because he promised Gary-san that if anything happened to Sicil,
I see.
Saying all of this nonsense is not going to help find Sicil!

From now on, I plan to keep him by my side and help him become a first-class actor.
You... want to interview?
Naozumi-kun, Naozumi-kun...
Found him!
I support you guys, absolutely. You'll get a good night's sleep.
Sorry. Because we have to get to a rehearsal, please end your questions now.
This way.
You guys are from Japan, right?
Eh! You were the one who told him?
Ever since I became unable to dance, I've really hated myself.
You...
I feel very blessed.
I want you to continue practicing your performance skills here on Broadway.
I would like to spend everyday here, wonderfully and blissfully,
"Last day" means that it's the last day for all of the performances.
The entire New York City is looking forward to the achievements of Gary Hamilton's son.
She's still the same, uncultured in her speech.
It's a party to congratulate everyone on their hard work.
Why would I say this? Because he is my son.
I'm sorry. I disappointed you.
You took out the small fishhook.
I'm sorry, Sicil.
I'm so glad to have met you. I'm really glad.
No matter what happens,
Brad, why are you crying?
What should I do?
Please come any time.
Yes, Michelle-san.
Naozumi-kun and I have perhaps become stronger than before.
We're starting the explanation.
The stage is a city like New York from the old days.
The minute people start singing, they are arrested. What a dilemma.
This stuff is not important!
Ha, ha, ha. Caught in the act.
How do you know who sang and who didn't to make your arrest?
To be tricked by those people and then to let them escape, how can I stand it?
Agent Tomita. What?
What's the meaning of this?!
The best money partner.
This time I'm really out permanently.
The boss has been arrested. That means his position is empty.
Aren't you singing, Aya-chan?
I've just arrived here.
Everyone who sang has been photographed by this camera.
Wait a minute!
This person is only holding an instrument. He hasn't started playing.
How can she hear such a soft sound from all the way over there?
Yes, yes. It was a Boooo sound.
Understand?
Handsome Naozumi...
Why would that person come to this town?
The whirlpool of happiness.
This will give me an excuse if I get in trouble.
Just like this, everyone's happily singing.
Ah, we're screwed!
This time we won't let you escape.
Thanks to Agent Tomita, we were able to plant this tracker.
Good job, Tomita.
in reality it didn't.
Thank you very much for protecting me that time.
However, that sound wasn't the sound of a fart.
I played it.
Thank you.
If you play it, I will arrest you.
When did you arrive?
I've already repealed it.
Because of this, all of the people who were arrested will be set free.
The deer in my heart is jumping around like crazy.
The port city of love.

Asako, Asako, it's you.
What first time?
You were a weirdo back then, Nao-pyang.
But that Naozumi-kun is sitting beside me right now.
Fate is a really strange thing.
Today, I'm gonna become a Jinbo middle school first year student.
Sure, but I bet you can't do it!
My name is not Buka, it's Fuka!
Elementary school graduation, Takaishi tells me he likes me.
...she wants to take a picture with you,
I don't even know this girl, and to think she will have a picture of her and me...
...and... interesting.
Hiroto played by Kamura Naozumi.
You should tell her before she leaves.
Excuse me, please stop the bus for a second!
No me... lt was real.
Yeah.
Actually...
What do you mean?
Scary growing machine.
Look up to me.
I feel as if there's a wall between us.
Because both of you are couples...
...l'm the only one who's single.
Do you really love me?
I was wondering what took you so long so I came to check...
I'm going to concentrate on my acting career.
I'll find a good man soon.

Good morning, Akito-kun.
Don't you think this is terrible?
What... it's so dirty.
We'll be having a pop quiz.
I heard you.
This one...
Really. That's great.
Can I have some French fries?
Hayama-san, Hayama-san.
Ah! I'm sorry...
Just joking.
Just call him Hayama-kun.
Hey, Hayama, are you ditching class?
Did you see me?
That's good.
Don't worry about it.
So, how's it going?
You know... Hayama-kun is so ahead of us...
...it wouldn't be strange if you've had one or two kids by now.
It's not porno, it's actually a very cute conversation.

TOWA and ICHI, 2 HA's and eye and Mata.
One and two, and one and two and three!
You're really slow! Out of the away!
Tsuyoshi-kun, they're over there.
Are you two junior high school students?
It's a popular magazine.
Really? I'm so honored.
Ok?
Excuse me... could you take a picture of us too?
How much film is left?
I know.
Hello, is this Matsui Fuka's residence?
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
I am feeling Ultra Relax,

Now he's going out with Fuka.
Sana-chan, look over here about the rumor that you two are dating...
Hey! Wait a second! Sana-chan, Naozumi-kun!
Sana is back.
I didn't say anything,
Whatever you say.
Sana-chan and Naozumi-kun's play was a big hit in New York.
And those weird dances.
I'm Matsui Fuka's mother.
You mean Hayama-kun?
What is it?
You...
That's not true, Sengoku-sensei is not worried about me at all.
why didn't you do something useful?
Just a second.
Did I scare you?
What happened?
Why did he have to call my mom?
Let's just think this is all Sengoku-sensei's fault, and forget this.
Yolole, Yolole, Yolole-hee.
One, and Two and One, and Two, Five!
Aya-chan, what you said is a little...
But they could be really going out.
Then let's go visit her.
Can I tell them that the couple in the magazine is here?
Then I'll tell them.
You're careless all the time.
What?! This is Sana's house?
Long time no see!
That's no problem.
He's really popular.
We were twin fairies.
Akito, you know a lot about Sana's family.
cried with me, got angry at me, cheered me on...
- Right? - This is the first time I heard you say that.
What about our picture?
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,

Yes!
Fuka!
Hayama, this is great.
It feels like everybody has won the best couple award.
Akito, the whole time you weren't happy that we won the best couple prize.
- Right? - Yeah.
you'll be UN-HAP-PY.
It's about time you have this sort of emotion then.
Wait for me.
We were planning to invite you two...
This is Sengoku-sensei from Jinbo school.
because suddenly I got really hungry.
Because this is shake shake dance!
But this is decided by the agency.
How can it be so sudden?
it would be terrible.
Kusanagi Chris-chan.
You jerk! You jerk!
It didn't hurt!
This is not funny.
It's getting late.
- See you later! - See you!
- Then what are you called? - I am Ozaki Riho.
Wah! Sana-chan! You are a great person!
Never come to this restaurant
I forgot to make the lunchbox.
Geez...
That guy...
If you mind Sengoku, then you shouldn't have come today.
Last five laps!
Akito-kun!
But in school, teachers can do whatever they want.
Can do whatever is like this, it's not.
Eh... how should you say this...
Soon there will be a ranking test.
Look at yourself closely.
Should we say Riho-chan is cute or sexy?
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.

Before meeting Sana-chan, didn't you stand more in the spotlight?
Yes!

Isn't it embarrassing?
Why should you apologize?
Just a note. Please, no phone calls at three in the morning.
Wonder where he's off.

Akito, where are you going?
...adultery is always wrong...
We knew this day would come some day
That startled me, Babbit's...
Good morning.
Hi, Naozumi-kun.
What? You want to wear that?
Why don't you be honest with yourself?
We've just received the script.
I heard that the script was finished yesterday.
Hooray for Riho-chan.
How do you cook earwax?
But you must use your main character mentality to act the best in you.
How are you? Thank you for all you've done for us.
It'll be better if you are more honest with yourself...
Sana-chan, this scene with Shinji is all yours.
Starting the sixth scene.
Wanna take one, Aya-chan?
It looks like fun.
Let's try again.
Sorry.
No... not that. It's just that if it's possible can we change the line?
How can you say something like that to him?
I'm sorry, may I borrow her for a second?
Fuka, do you have two hundred yen? I'll pay you back.
OK.
Akito...
Damn... shut the hell up.
- Fuka-chan! - What are you guys doing?
It hurts.
Tsuyoshi-kun, how is Fuka? What about Hayama?

Her cornea... But they say it can definitely be cured.
Hayama.
No worries! No worries! No worries! No worries!
You had a day off to visit Fuka-chan
Nine? Ten? Or already midnight?
Akito... he doesn't think about kissing me.
Though he tries to hide it,
I can sense it.
Ahh! I want to see it! Lemme see!
Morning.

I'll have to do it no matter what! Alright!
You're... you're...

Dance! Dance! Hey, hey, hey!
Sorry! Let me sort out my mind for a little!
I want to say it in my mind,
Who does she think she is?! I absolutely hate those actresses.
Naozumi,
Naozumi-kun.
It's a shadow without its true self.
Ah, Sana-chan, I don't know either!
Calm down, Rei-kun.
Yes, just give me an hour and I promise I'll bring Sana-chan here to you.
How can this be?
You are in big trouble.
That's not fair, it's the other's fault!
Ah, Akito-kun!
Akito-kun...
Before we announce the list of actors,
I apologize, my parents said really mean words.
Because I caused it.

Ah, Sana-chan, are you going out?
Let's go to work!
I've put it next to the radio.
Oh, alright...
She's going to the window.
It's pretty obvious.
How can you just come into a girl's room? Idiot.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I think you'll have to deal with it today.
Okay.
Akito? Akito?
Looks like the situation's gotten big.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
I feel as an actress being a little headstrong is alright.
So you do look down on adults?
You don't know anything. What basis do you have to say that?
Do you think we went too far?
What are you saying, Fuka?
You...
Sana...
She likes you.
She still likes you.
Am I making things difficult for you?
I keep hurting Fuka.
Hayama.
What's wrong?
Ghost?
What? It was hard for me to come up with such a good name!
That's not the same thing... Mine belong in a higher class.
Hey, isn't that Sana-chan?
Alright, bye.
Uh, no.
Nobody understands.
Here, you can tell me your troubles.
No way! I can't believe it.

Kurata Sana's mask is taken off.
She hasn't come out of her bedroom since this morning.
Well, I guess it's all good for other child idols.
Before you play, don't you have something to do, Sana?
Harmonica, Ocarina? Or is it Ukulele??!
Uniform, uniform... there.
It's obvious she must go to school.
Bye! I'm taking off!
Did you see today's Wideshow?
I wonder if it's true.
Hey. Is that Kurata?
There are even students from other classes!
I don't have an immature personality in this school.
Oh, then show it in your attitude.
Listen attentively to your lessons.
It's been a long time, Sana!
I think it means that if you use too much English
Sana-chan, are you sure you just came back from America? That's just...
It's funny. No bad.
Fuka...
Good afternoon.
It's ok, right?
Yeah! I can see! I can see very well!
Hey everyone, I have something to tell you.
A one a two a one two two!
Nowadays cheating is the big thing so 'don't do it'
Hayama-kun and Fuka will never go out again.
every time there's a misunderstanding. I think this time it's the same thing.
Hello, Akito-kun?
Yeah, she got her bandage off and is out of the hospital.
I see. I'm glad.
Yeah, me too.
Are you going somewhere with Matsui-san?
He has a lot on his mind.
Should we walk together for a bit?
Coming every day to the hospital,
I never knew that you were suspended.
I don't think that it's kindness to be nice to a person that you don't like.
It seems so.
Hayama-kun already received a 10 day suspension!
Yes.
Not me...
Akito.
I heard that your drama's filming is over now.
No, you use that in front of royalty!
Because you couldn't say the word 'devil'.
that's why you couldn't say it.
that you still love Hayama-kun.
Enough already, Sana-chan.

You are such a thoroughly aggravating fellow!
Listen, why don't I pretend like I'm your mother?
So I take it out on Akito, and call him a devil...
I love you, A-chan, and that's why I tried so hard to have you.
We have to take that as your answuh!
I want to talk! Rei, make sure you call me! I'll be waiting!

This isn't going fast enough, so I'm moving it along.
Let's wait till we've hoid the whole question.

How was I supposed to answer that!?
That's all.
--Shimura-san! There's still some cake, right? --Hmm? Shimura-san?
You can't! You can't, okay!?
I get pretty embarrassed when I think about the way I was a little while ago.

That's not it.
Okay, can anyone else answer?

No, it's water in the ear.
Be quiet! You're denseness deserves 100 whacks.
- Enough already! - No, 50 more!
Why, why?
Am I bad or something? I don't understand!
I know, in this case...
When I was in New York, I had the feeling of wanting to protect him.
You have to look that hard to find a textbook?
It was one year ago. There were so many things that happened.
Sana-chan, you didn't do a lot of your homework.
Then I guess that's a no.
I guess it can't be helped... it's just the two of us then.
Really! It was fun!
Christmas Eve Day!
By the way, the last drama that I did will be premiering today.
I want to reach my highest potential as an actor.
Naozumi's so cool!
You're such a good guy, Naozumi.

Would you like to spend the night at my house, miss?
Oh Christ-sama! I'm so glad that I have lived my life seriously.
I have to go back home and watch the drama!
Go.
So that drama...
Last year everyone was here.
Hayama was here.

How come there is a mother robot and an additional giant robot?
Although it's not very fun there, if it got destroyed there's no second one.
And in the aquarium there, they have goldfish that know how to smile.
Magical spin.
If you keep acting like this, Hayama's dad is going to die.
Why would the robot know how to attack?
Then, Sana-chan, good-bye.
She hasn't changed a bit yet.
It's working.
I would've never thought that a robot would have emotions.

We all ate different things,
We're better than a skunk.
We have to find out before noon.
But why is this happening? We're clueless.
I'm not sure.
But now a toilet seat.
Toilet seat, no, Prince Naozumi, why do you look like this...?
Really. We now know the reason why you look like this.
Not only you don't feel sorry, but you're also saying it's someone else's fault.
Wasn't the old lady really mad earlier?
Then I'll read it.

I didn't hear anything about her going on a vacation.
It's possible.
I haven't got anything to wish for. I'm satisfied with how things are right now.

God will punish you for saying a thing like this!
I have my troubles too.

You haven't worked in a long time! You're gonna be late on the first day!
I'll see you later!
Well, well, the most important is the content of the job.
Ah, wait up!
- Let's begin. - Yes.
I'm glad, so let's get started.
Because we have no money.
You have an uneasy look in your face, but that's alright
They used to call color films this.

Ok.
- Is it? - Really?
I'm the math teacher.
From problem 5.
Nanda-chan, please read the problem.
You said something unnecessary again.
What is this job?
It can't be true! A middle school student Sana can't do multiplication?!
but I understand Sana-chan's reasoning.
Sana took this job at temporary too.
Ah! You mean the one in France?
But cross out London, circle the math video!
Yeah, that's right, Mama.
At this time, a friend I should depend on is...
I wanna go to a country without math.

Of course I'm still upset. I'm the real one.

Hey, proposal, proposal!
This proposal means life or death for me!
Still angry?
Can it be...
- It's... - What?
- It's heavy... - Sana-chan, are you done yet?
Everybody!
Under the gaze of my sharp, firm eyes
If you walk off the road you have to go along
but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
Takaishi-kun...
Yuuta is out with his friends.
As I was saying,
There will be a lot of cute girls!
Oh, that? Don't worry.
And both of them were drawn!
That's alright! I can just go with Aya-chan!
Aya-chan! I'll stick with you forever!
Everyone's talking about it...
Please do.
Oh. Fuka-chan, you'll come, right? To the Teen Net Event.
That one? It's this photo.
Yeah, I'm gonna try this time.
- Okay! - Are you alright, Tsuyoshi-kun?
This is a friendship chocolate.
What did you want to tell me?
Want to write love letter to the love.
Even if it isn't him, but it's alright.
The long awaited new feature in Kodocha...
It will be the first time I've ever portrayed a heroic figure, I'll be famous!
The producer lied!
My dream of becoming a hero is over...
That's right, just like you said. I'll play my part and work hard!
We're 'The Always Willing Trouble Helpers'!
My club has very strict rules, so, I'm sorry about today.
Excuse me, my back itches, will you scratch it for me?
Hmm? Event...
What happened to Fuka-chan?
Would you like you to go to the 'Love Fight' Cam with us?
There are too many girls here, can you find me some guys to come here?
This... this woman.
Would you like to go to the Valentine's Event?
Like pizza, sushi, and etc...
Sushi!
Becomes this in Takaishi's eyes.
How did I get in here?
What did you say...?
Hi! Zen-sama...
This might be good chance!
- Even I started dancing! - It is pretty gorgeous!
Zen-sama, let's limbo!
- Fuka. - Yeah?

But Takaishi-kun, he is very stupid. Let me tell you...
Yeah, yeah, of course...
Is that so...
If it can smooth develop, it will be good.
It seems she doesn't like it when I talk about Takaishi-kun.
It's an educational yet entertaining show.
- After this... - I'm going to Shibuya.
It'll be hard for her to find a job when she comes back.
Rei, it's me.
You're so cold to Asako-san. You're not being very nice.
Yes, I'm Sagami, I've been waiting for your call for a long time, sir!
This is excellent! Now your talents will be really appreciated.
Sana-chan, you're not getting married, are you?
Me, Sana of course, Shimura-san...
...and of course Sagami is going to be interviewed too, as well as Maro-chan.
Our New Year's agreement!
Ah, sorry, we're filming right now.
Have you seen the director?
Rei!
What? You didn't hear a single thing I said about such an important event?
At that time... New Year's Eve...
I'm excited too, I want to help her find more to do...
Sagami-san.
Shimura-san is like that from the beginning.
Asako, have you already left...?
How am I supposed to know?
Oh, I should have asked her when was she leaving.
Ah, I forgot about the bonsai tree.
Oh yeah, I should ask Asako's company.
No problem, wse all know very well...
but, in comparison to some real families
Rei...
Shimura-san, Sagami-kun isn't here.
Yes.
- Let us dine first. - I will go prepare it immediately.
Let's watch some television.
- What are they doing?! - So Rei-kun is at the airport!
And you will wait for me...
His car got towed for being parked in the street. And the police scolded him.
But at last, the Kurata family got a portrait to call its own.

This is my best friend who I am sleeping with, Hayama-kun! Just kidding.
Long time no see.
You are that...
The guy who never works seriously always borrowing money...
You have to return the money you borrowed!
It's Mama's ex-husband.
You are becoming prettier and prettier.
Manager-sama, hello, hello!
Why am I here?
Why should they stop hanging around? I choose to stay here.
I don't know what to say...
I'm actually planning on marriage...
Her name is Miyoko-san. She's Makoto-kun's mother.
Yeah, I've tried talking to him many times...
So I thought I could solve it with money.
Oh, is that right?
But it has nothing to do with this.
Oh! Sorry, I was just talking to myself.
To become a great person.
A life like this isn't too bad either...
Today we're at the streets again, looking for people who need help.
You're really following the script and acting stupid, aren't you?
- Here he is? - I'm the person in need of help.
Didn't he tricked you into working at a wedding for free?
This is very worrisome.
Hey, banana peels, abacuses and skateboards?!
But your mother is really worried about you.
Meat and potato?
- Oh? Really? - Do I look like Shinohara?
I was going to speculate peacefully on the development of this matter...
- Makoto-kun? - I'm Shingo.
Just in case, I'm Kurata Sana.
Misako...
Actually, he is a gigolo.
He's a nice person, has a good personality and isn't very sly.
Anyway, the point is...
So, will you stop doing such silly things?
This has nothing to do with you...
If you don't want your mother to marry, then just say so!
I wouldn't do this if Ryosuke-san was going to be my father.
So you finally understand my situation?
He only thinks about himself, and he's a cold, selfish person.
Makoto-kun, I'll ask you again.
But you don't' know if that's true, right?
Makoto!
But I think I understand a little.
Ah, I'm not yours! Get off me!

My friend, Hayama Akito.
Male one?
Gosh, Akito! You don't need to be so suspicious!
Is it a boy?
Natsumi... is acting a little different than usual...
Cut this in half.
Here you go!
My best friend's elder sister.
No wonder it took away your attention.
Time's gone when you two were staring at each other.
I'm home!
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Oh, welcome home, Natsumi.
I witnessed Sister Natsumi dating at that particular location!
Her is her... Me is me...
You said Natsumi was on a date, right?
Is that so?
No way!
Oh, yeah, Sana-chan! Wanna have dinner?
- It's the first time I see him sunned like that. - Me too.
Umm... should I tell Hayama's sister?
What should I do...?
Ah! Fuka!
What were you mumbling about?
How did you know?
- Hayama-san? - Yes.
Hi.
seems a bit scary.
I don't know what to say!
There's nothing! Don't get so suspicious!
Oh, you're having stewed pork today.
What?
used to be a bad kid.
What are you talking about, dad?
Dad thought about you having a boyfriend...
Not again!
I gotta go.
And the next one today is...
You planned on buying that, remember?
Goodbye.
We should hurry to take a look!
That's why I say he is so fake!
Ah, wait. Don't move.
What the...?!
We have the proofs, you better tell me truth!
That... that hurt!
Are you alright? Are you okay?

Under the gaze of my sharp, firm eyes
Rather than walking around in circles
Pu! on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and lo spare,
Sagami Rei-kun. He's both my chauffeur and my manager,
as well as my boyfriend and pimp!
What? What? What? "What!?"
"Operation Eyeball, Toothball!"
Fine... I'm fine...
This could be pretty fun.
Ah! Hey, now!
You dumb-ass! There's no way Hayama-san is scared!
After all, I love being in high places!
Here I go!
That was the flaw in my strategy.
I'm not sure what happened, but that means I won, right?
That must be how I got so scared!
"It's the worst of schools"
an8"'How to Console Women' by Obana Miho"
Sana-chan, if you keep gnashing around like this, you're going to become a gnat.
Shut up!
Here you go.
This book is filled with nothing but lies.
I can't stand the life of a teacher!
No, this isn't the sort of thing you can talk to a child about.
Well, you see... that is to say... uh...
At the time, we just... got caught up in the mood, you see...
What!?
Ah, thanks.
Yeah, he'll explain what he means, but about those make-out--
Rei-kun, you're so smart!
Say, Sana-chan, are you sure you won't give this up?
Now then, how shall we lure him out, Washington-kun?
A family quarrel?
"Devil"? Is that really his sister? I can't believe it. I mean, "devil"...
How come? How come he didn't ask him anything? How come?
When did the operation get that name?
I got a silly picture of you there in the huff!
...for two.
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Or so we thought, but what's this, what's this?
and yet you always shilly-shally,
My former boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun.
Hey, Rei-kun, unless you translate for us, the story won't move forward.
Me!?
Above awl, you've got to let go of yourself, and fight with spirit.
"That's because you're a nice person,
Let's go.
Now, now, calm down, everyone.
My goodness, welcome!
That's right. You've become a fine older sister.
Not so cute after all...
You don't resemble him one bit.
--Sana-chan's reception party ready!
This is Naozumi-kun when he was little?
So you see, Nao-chan became such a fine older brother thanks to you, Sana-chan.
I guess dat's drue. Id's like a hobe to be, doo.
Mm-hmm.
Sensei told you, huh!?
 this is Sana-chan's first composition! 
My, "hag" is not a word you would use on a young 6th-grader,
like myself, you silly.
That's right.
He isn't really a bad boy.
Three seconds, did you say!?
Three!
"Oh, Uncle..."
Okay, here I go!
Miserable Mini-Hayama! I'll just move on to my next technique at below cost!
you'll have to behave yourself!
If you've got something to say, say it.
and it turns out she's playing around something royal.
Over there.
--We are the Sannas!
 Good grief, it's hard to tell if Akito-kun and Sana-chan... 
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
...up to now, just for today,
from anyone's viewpoint.
and for an American feeling, Texas!
but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
blur2nigamushi hara no mushi nahe nahe to
Uh-huh, you would have thought yesterday's episode was funny, too.
I'm sorry.
he'll admit if he did it!
But that Hayama says that he did not hit anyone.
Yeah, even if I trip and hit someone, he'll probably say that I abused karate.
Yeah, I know.
Oh yeah! Sana, can you come to the Gymnatics District Competition?
Ok, you are actually on the Gymastics team, right?
What is it?
How could I start the Karate Club?
Actually I haven't any idea at present.
flashing a smile, really good.
We're looking for Karate Club members...
would you join the Karate club?
I'll think about it.
I know it was gonna be like this.
Who are you?
Come in!
Nakao-kun, any experience with karate?
Hey, everyone! I called Suzuki-sensei.
- Yah. - Let's go, Nakao-kun!
Nobody uses it so I thought this would be good.
Isn't there any place bigger than this?
- Sensei! - I'm alright!
Yes, Sensei.
One more person...
Great!
Because in the end, we're the ones who are gonna be held responsible.
Sengoku-sensei...
Those people, if we put on a sweet face, they will run wild.
That's why I wanted to make the Karate club.
Ok, try that.
Alright, we're done for today.
- Um, I... I can't... - You can't?
Today thank you for being here for Sana while you guys are busy.
To be frankly, it's me, Sana-chan's birthday of 13 years old.
March 7, March 7.
Wow, Sana-chan! Congratulations, congratulations!

Absent!
It's our precious attendance name plates.
Don't worry about it. You're not fit for karate.
That one with the voice like a girl.
No, it's not Nakakaruizawa, it's Nakanoshima.
Sana-chan, let's work hard with me,
Karate is not about looking cool!
Well, well, stop it.
His nose is bleeding!
He's not there. He already went to school.
Sorry to keep waiting! I, Kurata Sana, the nichoku, has delivered the eraser to you.

Actually Nakao-kun didn't come home last night.
Me and my husband have a small transportation company
So before then Nakao-kun wasn't home?
- No, not really. - You must haven't cared about it.
He was absent because he felt exhausted for an after school activity.
But that has nothing to do with Nakao-kun.
If you get involved with Hayama-kun's karate club, nothing good will happen.
So have you thought it over?
I didn't think much of what would happen later if I joined.
and I was made to quit Karate Club, I have nothing left anymore!
I bet something happened. Hayama made no explanation and the atmosphere is bad.
Hayama is the one who pressured him into this!
- Mrs. Nakao, please call the police. - Yes.
You can't see what's in front of you
Let's gather some courage and set this straight now
Love me deeper, hold me, I wanna hurt you

My precious no absence record has been destroyed
I'm thinking about my work too...
But I'm sure that your feelings could be only understood by yourself
What the hell?!
Oh, you're here.
to look for clues on his whereabouts,
The rumor spread quickly
I heard that kid Nakao ran away because of Hayama's torturous training.
Ah... my mother is diagnosed with an incurable disease, so I have to nurse...
Where are you going, Hayama?
Right now, only Sana should go.
You're thinking about that...
So you're feeling irresponsible for not thinking about him, right?
That's such a general way of thinking.
This voice that pisses me off.
I'm sure Nakao is fine
You made Nakao think he had no reason to keep on living.
But I'm saying that you have no meaning in life.
You've gone to far.
But anyway, when something does happen to Nakao, then prepare yourself.
I'm in charge of the chalkboard erasers so I know.
Say energetically loud!
Shup up.
My neck doesn't move.
Nakao-kun?
When you apologize from the heart then you look at the person.
Hmm... Yes.
Me?
That'right, so let's get out of here.
Cool? Who's cool?
And live on his own world...
If I explain it with a diagram, then it would be fast.
If you're born then there's no such human as a human with no meaning in life.
Nakao-kun?
Brother?
But it's alright, don't you guys worry.
I won't say that anymore so...
There is a chance of that!
It's fun!
Sana!
Matsui, Sugita!
That's ridiculous...
Sana-chan disappeared, what is all this about?!
In the school? Suzuki-sensei, Sengoku-sensei,
do you have any clue on where they are?

I don't know the circumstances but I guess it's true.
...your friend?
You don't have to worry about Nakao-kun.
I see.
If you weren't there, maybe I would have...
Hayama...
That night was long.
No one said anything...
- Right, Hayama? - Yes.
Excuse me.
Oh, he got a message from Kyoto-sensei.
Ah, Nakao kun is back to normal?
Yes! I got it!
Um...
And then...
I didn't do anything, I became reluctant, I was mad about my death.
Hayama...
Me too, I'm just like you.
Matsui!
You guys didn't come back last night so...
I wonder what's gonna happen next.
I was thinking of the Karate Club and going to the same high school as Hayama.
When you questioned if I was in your class I thought that I was not a living being.
Nakao-kun is going to continue doing Karate club with us.
So you're saying you have read that letter.
That's a shame.
Maybe adults are like that. But children are not.
Um... I'm able to come to school from today.
Hayama!
Oh, what are you doing? You pervert! You kissing idiot!
Ok.

We'll do it after school.

But why Croquet?
Hayama, go back to hell where you came from, demon child!
Good luck, Sana-chan.
You're the only one who can stop Akito-kun.
I didn't say I was in love with him! My love is for a girl!
I'm in love with you Sana-chan!
I already have a pimp named Rei-kun.
You mean that was TRUE??
What the hell are you doing?
I'll get some dry clothes.
Hit me why don't ya!
I didn't do anything.
Speaking of smart,
You mean, Bag of KAN-NIN Patience!

Stop getting in my way or else!
you can win today's

What's gonna happen tomorrow at school?
Sana-chan, don't be depressed...
I'll never rest...
You! Quit it!
this is all your fault!
Really?
We often sit this gymnasium...
teachers were making out in school!
She allowed me to make out in order to dance the Chi-Chi-Ku-Ri Mambo!
But I won't forgive him! That Hayama!

...I think things will be a bit different.
You think so?
What's that?
It's!
What was that?
This isn't your house...
What the hell are you doing!?!
Well, this is nothing!
If you do anything to Sana-chan...
I waited for his reply
I may have my mind made up...
He was there...
Please don't be embarrassed.
You can tell it accurately.
Huh... easy going
Give me the picture of the teachers.
Is this all?
Yes.

I'm really sorry.

It couldn't be! Why it became so many for a sudden.
If you know what you have done,
C'mon, c'mon...

You'd better apologize better, or you know what's coming...
Now are you satisfied?
Well she brought back the pictures!
Look at this! So many postcards are coming!
It's gone well for YOU, huh?
Cut it out.
Akito-kun, are you alright?
Stop it. You two!

I'm really not good at guarding!

I don't. Why?
What's that?

What do you want?
I said I don't want to see your face again!
at home AND at school.
Um, Mom?
What is it, Ohki-kun?
I...
He does this every year.
Didn't you know?
I've heard of this.
Every time you take care of this.
Yep... Cheer up.
Don't mention it. You have a nice side to you, Hayama.
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.

Let's check it out!
This way!
Let's go!
I don't know!
My lord, I assume they are admiring you, sir.
He's different from others, I always think so!
Look at her, very ugly, right?
or make a mess out of the class again.
and fool around there?
...and it makes me happier to think what will happen next.
and get happy!
please feel free to ask.
I'm not gonna stop you!
It's irritating!
I knew it. There must be something wrong.
I'm glad. You look recovered.

It's wild. It's easy. It's nutritious...

What are you doing?
What do you mean, you have to work?
This is all because of you, Akito!
Stop saying that!
So, let's get on with class!
Hey, I'm the teacher here!
Is it a gift for someone?
I can't even study.
Over here!
But I'm not going to let that stop me!
You can't ignore it either.
The sun is falling...
Please, don't blame our relationship...
I'm in sixth grade and in a theatrical company called Komawari.
See ya!
By the way, how about Hayama...
Akito-kun really believed that he was the son of a devil.
Like that.
I've heard that you're going to start taping the drama today.
No thanks.
My heart answered
Nice to meet you.
I love Kurumi-san!
I always watch you in Zenjirou-san's Child's Toy...
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.
Oh, good morning, Suzi-san.
Sana-chan is trying real hard.
That's the only way a schmuck like me can think.

And a karaoke party, swimming party, moon-viewing party!
I told you not to move.
I...
 --Karaoke, whoa, whoa!  --I'm no good...
--Aya-chan, seems like you and Tsuyoshi are getting along pretty well lately. --I'm no good...
There's also this tasty drama I'd like to talk to you for just a little bit,
No thank you.
Yes?
 I apologize more than Niagara falls. 
 Sorry, noodles, forgive me, tea table. 
The rest of the world...!?
 Cheering for you, toughing it out, sticking it out, too! 
I don't need you to cheer me on.
Aah! A baby!?
And this, and this, and this!
Akito, are you liking the karate dojo?
Yes?
And so, even if Sana-chan leaves show business, for her sake...
Calm down! We have to finish this location shoot in New York, first.
Rats...
Please stop!
Could she be avoiding me?
Nature! Freedom!
From now on, this freedom is going to continue on and on.
so here I am again.
this early in the evening!? Oh, it's you!
I've been waiting for an answer.
Huh!? Mariko-chan!
please don't be embarrassed.
You can tell it accurately.
In a city without light,
I'm Sana Kurata, 11 years old.
You killed mom! You're a devil! Demon child!
If only you had never been born!!
Sorry.
Oops, and the good-Iooking one in the sunglasses is my manager,
pimp, and boyfriend Rei-kun!
I am back
over at the Hayamas?
Of course, heh heh heh.
Your fever's gone down quite a bit.
I made it for you!
so I can't guarantee that it's good or anything.
You didn't sleep at all last night.
Well, I have to go to work now.
I told your sister to make dinner every night.
and your efforts paid off.
Because Rei-kun, you went to bed early by yourself last night!!
So Sana-chan,
I have this job for a magazine where I have a chat with someone.
Wow, I'll do it definitely!
Don't worry, I was going to give it back to you anyway.
Hayama-san,
Goodbye, pal!
What does it mean?
Thinking about going with this headdress - what do you think?
But no, yours is more important...
it's Rei-kun, Rei-kun, Rei-kun!
Swallow it!
Possessed by an evil spirit?!
3 nights for your paper.
What, Sensei, you have it done?
Mom says it's back knowledge from her novels.
You mean... secondhand knowledge.
Yes?
You're talking about Rei-kun?
And the he becomes my boyfriend!
In other words, a homeless bum!
There are terrible women in the world...
Oh crap, I think I talked too much!
But... but...
Asako-san, where are you going?
Rei!
She is always absent
She could get really big people.
But though it's called no way,
Look to your right, look straight ahead, look to your left.
If there's no cars then cross!
What are you thinking? Take off those sunglasses!
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
...of your other love?
At sunset,
You're asking for something not there.
I'm Sana Kurata, 11 years old.
It's been a long time.
What the hell is that?
Take off those glasses!
None of your business.
Oh, there you are! What are you doing, Asako-chan!
Asako-chan, come on!
I thought something was wrong.
Only Sana-chan!
You want to... talk.
Mama, see, today, the teacher really complimented me.
Is it good?
Anyway
I don't want YOU to pay for me.
W... wait a minute. That's because I...
I kind of heard so say it again!
Wow you're right.
No, I don't like this kind of development!
Awfully quiet isn't it.
Good timing
It's... Noisy!
I understand. If you get too close to me...
Uh, Sana-chan!
Sorry. You don't have to pick me up tomorrow.
See ya.
Rei, I want to really talk to you! Rei, please call!
That's it!!!
Smile good morning, smile good bye.
If you have a smile, then this earth is heaven!
He's scared of heights!!
Oh, what are you saying, spill it, come on, come on!
Like this, smaaack!
He looks really sick. Maybe I feel a sorry for him.
Huh?
Sae-chan got sick on the elevator...
so I thought a cold drink would help.
Come, hurry up.
I waited for his reply
In that ordinary classroom!
of your other love?
7 O'clock News!
I'm a 6th grade child actress.
Oh, forget about this one!
me problems yet again, HASN'T HE...!!!
Anyway you've got a twenty years old boyfriend.
It doesn't make any difference to you.
What's a big deal?
Oh!
Elevator going up.
Messed up.
Huh? What is this? What has become
But I can't forgive even Asako-san.
Stay away from Rei-kun!!!
That was kindness?
sea cucumber parfait.
Yay, yay, I'm gonna make you a woman!
So please overlook it!
O Lord, O Buddha, O Lord,
I feel very upset.
I didn't realize there were two observation decks.
Sana Makes a Face
This here... this here is... THIS IS TO BATTLE HAYAMA!
I wonder what German kissed an idiot like that.
Sana-chan! Are you all right?
I bet a dime on whether he could do it or not.
Alright, that's enough! Class should have started!
Oh! And before I forget, here's this week's picture of Sana!
So that's what happened. Thank you very much.
Bring me Hayama.
What...! Bastard! Are you kidnapping me?!
I didn't want to resort to this.
I see. You have nice eyes.
From now on, I leave my daughter in your hands.
I was brought here. Later.
upside down or anything.
as a leopard bite and forget about it,
Right.
about the other thing and avoiding me.
It's not like that.
Rei-kun, Rei-kun, Rei-kun!
Good morning!
and take care of it already.
But then after that, I lost both my parents in a car accident...!
When I woke up, I was among the garbages.
It's painful.
you could have stayed with me and
Rei-kun
Asako came to see you?!!
Don't be so easy going
You're asking for something not there.
I'm sorry, that's all we have time for today! This week's video... begin!
Are you not listening?
Hey, they ran away while I was talking...
What? What? What is it?
That's why I never want to hurt her...
You should hurry and realize it too.
Excuse me!
I'm in 2nd grade!
Oh, is that so?
So you have a little sister!
Put some more thought into it, idiot.
Reality, Sana...
I don't get it.
Have you written?
This week, Zenjirou-chan!
That thing yesterday, what was it about?
You may think you're in love,
that's a lie!
It's a lie, isn't is, Rei-kun? Tell me it's a lie!
Then... then that was really just playing lovers?
Sensei, this is cruel.
Rei-kun is my pimp and lover.
Rei-kun is my lover, okay?!
Thank you very much!
What's going on?
I can't go home anymore.
will she be as humiliated as I am?
That's what makes you a brat, idiot.
No!!
Why'd you kiss me?
What, kissing me because you don't hate me?!!
Do you hate this doll?
But even good people have bad points,
Welcome home.
Though I feel a little Ionely,
that'll be true always, won't it?
please don't be embarrassed.
Please, our relationship...
let's burn the fire of love.
Rei, my driver, broker, boyfriend and pimp...
Mum, please don't fire Rei-kun or anything, okay?
Wrong, wrong. That was 7,
Round and round!
Sana-chan, lately you haven't been much of a friend.
Just like why you are called Julet.
No good, one more time!
No good.
Oh, I can keep doing these kinds of scenes forever.
Jingle, jingle, snow falls down rhymes.
First off, we have a Honey Kampai commercial.
I can't do that, I'm an overachiever.
What's the matter?
When girls get their periods, Oseki rice is traditionally eaten.

So, take your time.
Work has been stressful.
One day when Akito, who always wolfs down his food,
His I don't hate it
Father, you're becoming more father like.
Love?
So that's it.
Well, why don't you ask him?
He said he doesn't hate me, so...
What, ya gotta be kidding me!
It's none of my business.
I got it.
Hayama, come on, you're the eldest son
Is he okay?
I would like for him to stay in the hospital
This is not good.
Very worried.
Oh? Aren't you seeing Hayama-kun now?
Keep?

No? I guess not.
Very moving.

However, she is rather delicate.

Babbit's been accompanying Sana all the time.
Anyone who speaks to Sana-chan will be outcast?
Isn't there some note going around? Let me see it.
I thought that too.
Fighting! Fighting! Go and have a look.
You bastard!
I don't like seeing you become like that.
But I won't get depressed.
I didn't say that I fight for you.
Really! Well...

or if we did something we shouldn't have done,
She's a soul's soul!
I'm really sorry!
You didn't have to apologize that much.

I visited Akito-kun's dad when went shopping.
Wow, you're right!
annoying dads and flying dads...
he's not Tsuyoshi Ooki anymore.
You've all been a great help.
What a foolish thing to say!
Oh this was no big deal.
I hate this...
so I have to be strong
Hayama'll never tell, never, both of us!
Don't keep your problems to yourself.
That's so super cheap!
I'm home!
He's coming to school tomorrow.
Hey, Sana-chan.
And you can shake your booty along the way too.
Oh, I get it!
The same Tsuyoshi-kun.
Sana-chan...
he just cares about his mom!
No way, Aya-chan!!!
A slow on the uptake, aren't we?
Then that makes it a love triangle! How cool!
since when have you wanted him?
Tell us.
You see, I didn't even
You did!
Right. Hey Happy Valentines take this,
It's all my fault.

First that I become a famous novelist,
and the other one that you would become

OK.
Well I think this is going to be a problem.
Ha ha ha, he called her a wrinkly hag!
What a problem Class 3 is!

I brought sashimi!
Would that be considered a snack?
He asked me to thank you.
Sing... Sing
The bus is a go-go, you are a go-go.
Everyone's snacks are 500 yen!
Don't stand up in a place like that! You'll die!!
Maybe there are real fireflies here.
We still have the fatty parts.
Where are you pointing to

Did something happen?
No, nothing's wrong.
What? We...
That's not fair, you guys!
Arghh, Principal! Is this okay for our education curriculum?
You are going well with Kurata-san,
I don't know.
Birds are singing on the branches.
Z... Zenjiro-chan!
You look nice normal too.
First of all, to limbo...
No way.
Now, is there anyone who'll try the height of a match stick?
Then we have to wait until they become quiet.
I...
I'M GOING TO BE VIOLATED!!!!
You ask me not to do it, then I won't do it idiot.
But you know,
people tell me it's not like Sana-chan
Do you have any worries, right?

So you must live for the both of us, Ah-chan.
Yeah.
I won't tell you.
Hayama...

When I see you are unhappy,
if you feel like crying, come to me.
That makes me really happy, Hayama.
It was really good, how cute!
H... how can I laugh when there's nothing funny.
Get out your spear! Get out your spear!
Get out your horn and laugh once more!
Hey don't run away, oh cute Hayama, hey now dance,
Come here and dance, one two one two.
I'm so glad you're okay!!
Feels like the murkiness in my heart cleared up.
I'm okay.
Did you get the manuscript done?
I'm gonna take it easy!
I'm really passionate about my acting...
All the commercials I filmed last month are all over TV!!
Ha ha, if you're in that many of them it gets annoying.
No way! Who is it who is it?? Who who?
With a boy.
Well if he's a boy, then he's definitely not a girl.
If he's not a girl, then he's boy.
Woah, Kamura-kun's that popular?
Oh he's like a fem boy?
That would be horrible.
This week's Sana-chan!
may be destroyed soon.
Hey Rei-kun isn't the Kamura boy here yet?
Well... it doesn't matter.
Sorry I kept you waiting! I'm Naozumi Kamura!

I blamed Uchiyamada-kun for eating all the ice cream.
Get money?
I want to leave an impression on you.
But my method was wrong.
But this line could be used, better write it down.
Naozumi-kun, you're my fan!
Since I'm wearing so nice. Just have a dance.
What a nice day it is!
When you're troubled, don't think!

Leave it to me! Come on, come on, what are you aiming at!?
I'm hitting something, right!?
You hit Babbit, too.
You can win like this?
Then again, I did go to the amusement park before...
Huh? Sistuh? But Sana-chan, you're an only child, right? Right?
No problem, no problem. Mariko-chan sure is cute, though, huh?
That game...
--But Uchiyamada-kun's free fall is awfully painful. --so long as nothing happens, right?
She said we could go away together!
Hey!
Will Mariko be all right?
Mm-hmm! It's really her!
I heard that "Child's Toy" is on location!
I want to see her! I want to see her!
I get the feeling that nuttin' is going right today.
Is this awl!? There's hawdly anything left at awl!
What? A retake?
 When my friends invite me by, suddenly, he's there! 
Sana-chan!
Yes, Sana-chan is right in the middle of shooting now.
They said she was talking about wanting to see Sana-chan.
I'm really going home, now!
That's kinda sad, too, huh?
Mister!
Go find this kid's parents!
Today, we have the always-cheerful Kurata Sana-chan, from "Child's Toy."

The day of our promises coming up.
Isn't she, Akito-kun?
Tsuyoshi-kun, your nose is bleeding.
You had your nose squashed a while ago.
Just one shot.
Then Akito answered, I will.
Do you want to have a look at that face?
You're not qualified for Sana-chan.
No, thank you.
Everybody'll laugh at me when they see my face...
I shouldn't say stuff like that...
What are you talking about?
even if it costs me my life!
That was enjoyable...
How was Sana-chan?
You'd have guys swarming over you...
Sana-chan's become quite the hottie too.
Like hell!
Like hell!
What's this?
This is fun.

On sale his morning, Misako Kurata's new book!
I want to introduce it from its shocked content.
how Kurata Sana who is her only daughter...
and is actively appearing on commercials on TV...
I'd like to ask Ms. Kurata what state of mind she was in when she wrote this.
I have thought that we are unlucky when I met my daughter...
in the novel The Gigolo and I...
Nothing else!
We want to know...
I was convinced that I could not live an ordinary life.
I went to see her everyday.
You don't need to be a star.
Do you understand, Sana?
How many of you have read my book to the last page?
When did you first think about this?
When? Can you tell that?
Hayama...
Hayama!
Wait, Hayama-kun!
What's wrong with the bike?
I read the book.
Serves you right.
The cliche...
I waited for his reply
when my friend suddenly invited me.
You can't ignore it either.
The sun is falling...
You can tell it accurately.
I'm worried about Mamas intentions.
Glad you liked it.
Here.
I simply told her that...
The only thing she's worried about is what her mom's thinking.
Oh, I'm SORRY!!
I fell ASLEEP!!
Ah, when did Hayama's father get here...?
Good, good... guy!
It's time for good children to go to bed.
Oh, Hayama!
Ramen! Ramen!
Oh, stop.
Can you believe Hayama's clothes fit like a glove?
I gotta learn to keep my fat yap shut.
What is that?
It's moving, it's moving!
you must be having a hard time.
Time heals all wounds.
All finished!
See you later. Hayama?
That's the objective of this book.
Do you want to see your real mother?
Hayama, I'm so glad...
But it looks to be calming down for now...
He's also...
Please leave her alone.
Yes, they took care of me.
I've never thought I was unlucky.
I'm sure there are people in worse situations who have parents.
Meanwhile, I'll protect her in my own way.
Oh, some of the media people have gone.
Lunch today is a Nori lunchbox!
Maybe Naozumi-kun wanted to protect Sana-chan.
I may have my mind made up...
That rumor that I love you is true...
You can tell it accurately.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You look like her.
I feel secure.
And Mama.
...in a row on her butt.
because you were young, didn't you?
Sensei!
Fourteen.
Oh, my father's dead.
I didn't know what had happened.
That is the day when Mama found me.
Oh, I see. Yes, you would be Samu.
My name is Sam.
Sam likes natto, cause it's sticky and yummy!
Yes, I do. I am sorry.
Is it OK?
Tell me or else...
Babbit is napping!
Sana-chan this week. He has disguised.
She watches me on TV. I heard she's one of my fans.
Quick! Quick!
You dropped this.
But keep it down, OK? I came here today incognito.
Turning and turning!
Mariko-chan, listen.
Shana-chan, is this like Chinderella?
To be honest with you I am not interested in you at all.
Then I couldn't have met Mama...
Better split these lines up some more.
to tell you everything...
So I wanted to find her...
Yes, you are an adult.
Hey, you two! How have you been to school so early?
The cliche...
He was there...
He was there...
In that ordinary classroom!
Abandoning the other love...
Is your daughter's name Tororo?
Next is the manga artist who really knows Kodomo, Miho Obana.
Oh, you wanted to introduce yourself.
It's 830!
OK.
It was fine until now.
Class has begun already!
Be quiet, be quiet!
If I am gotten so easily...
Well, I'm wearing gym shorts, so I'm all right.
...it's crucial to attack your opponents weak spot.
Weak spot?
I heard that!
Wahaha, Hayama Akito. This is the end of you!!
I'm gonna make you laugh someday...
Seeing the image of him later...
Hurry home and get in front of the TV!
Ah, it is Sensei this time.
So Hayama-kun left all the other competitors far behind in the first half
Sana-chan, are you going home early?
I want to finish this off quickly because it's easy.
Just that can make me upset!
Only a couple of questions are left.
I just wanted to see this Hayama.
Love is strong.
Someone wants to see you.
It is Obana-chin. Obana-chin is pressing the button.
I'll tell you my past.
This is strange. I'm all right.
But I think you were my first love.
I want to keep on thinking that my feelings were true.
Now it's your opportunity, Sanekichi.
Was that a guess?
Hayama-kun, the runners up prize is a pretty heart-shaped toning machine.
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
is true, yes it is.
At sunset,
Today's incident is burning love!
The mysterious white bat commentator!
Wuz up, Babbit?
Naozumi Kamura,
pretty boy actor from my very own Kamura Academy!
After the whole mother-thing was taken care of,
Until one day...
It's Naozumi-kun!
Oink? What?
And compete with pure will.
Should we be skipping work?
You haven't been to Tode in awhile.
I've already got lots of parents and family at the Kamura Academy.
My family is really looking forwards
Scenery my butt!
She's here, she's here!
Naozumi-kun, do you get around like that everyday?
...and even manage to do this!
I'm Ayumi.
Once I mentioned you were coming...
Wow, who'd have thought?
I tell him that I'm fine,
All I ever did was goof around!
Welcome HOME?
...and they think of it as their home.
That's true.
Sing for us, Sana-chan!
Is that all you have to say?
I've never had such a warm reception!
Kou-chan, you can't just go around hitting girls like that!
Whatever do you mean by annoying?
Alrighty then, let's look it up.
Exactly, stupid.
I'VE COMPLETELY SNAPPED!!!
and the super-strong vacuum cleaner too!
Yeah, I got it, I got it!
Coming, coming, coming!
Actually, there is!
Here goes!
This week's Sana-chan! Can you see her?
but I don't think of you as a little sister.
After all, I've always thought of you as...
Let go of me, old lady!!
I do so.
The showdown of Mini Hayama versus Hayama!
But no violence, understand?
So you DO have something to say.
Hayama, you stupid, evil, dirty pervert!
Take a look. There.
Are they friends or are they enemies?
There goes, there goes, Naozumi-kun!
I may have my mind made up...
We became the merry-go-round.
He was there...
when my friend suddenly invited me.
In that ordinary classroom!
Whether you're awake or asleep,
by ridding you...
You can tell it accurately.
Hey, "Dad", the background is dark...
Give it your best shot, Rei-kun.
I get to have a big barbecue in the backyard, make tons of odango,
and live a normal elementary school kid's life!!!
Which will you choose?
So, who's winning?
You really are... you know.
You're not going to watch anymore?
How is it going?
I want to... take karate.
Bug catching net! An tube, a bathing suit, an inflatable boat, a skateboard,
Was there a first time? Matsunami Dojo
I came here because...
Let's sing hey,
I don't think that'll happen,
I'm going to watch the karate practice with Tsuyoshi tomorrow,
Sana-chan, they're taping Kodoch a today, okay?
But it's such a good part!
She has fulfilled her promise...
So you're really planning to go through with this, huh?
Hayama, go!
Sana will cheer you on la la la la la!
Anyway, I'm a pretty busy person so see ya.
Otherwise, how could I stand in your side?
Like this, like this, like this, and...
Like this is karate!
Yes...
If we make some smart comment
No one could hear it
Rei-kun pressed the Burrucha at a time like this!!!
Y-you shouldn't joke like that
D, did you just say "sir"?? You DID!
and even put away the dishes!
Actually, enough to make up for all that she's missed out on.
I warmed them up for you.
Hey! It's summer now!
or have to grin and bear it when I'm exhausted.
I'll go back even if I have to jump off!
Hayama, what happened to your hand?
Where are you going, Sana-chan?
after suddenly hitting me?
...so why?
See ya.
D, don't cry!
if you all are saying that...
Okay! Since everyone's here
let's all celebrate!
Hey, aren't you...
I'll do all I want to do with both playing and work!
He was there...
Really, I miss you all day and all night!
Living is a fault!
My dearest Mama is an Aoki Award winning author.
The mysterious white bat, Babbit!
With other's defenses lowered, raise thy own defense.
Sana Kurata here! My score is 95!
Well, you're really good at this, Sana.
See! I knew it! Hey everyone!
S, Sensei! Sana didn't mean any harm by that!
Let's play together again sometime!
Today we'll have a shooting!
But can you play here by yourself?
I want to see it!
Where's my lunch?
What's so darn funny you brat?!
Did you find her?
Leave me alone... What's wrong with you?
Do you have any idea?
She couldn't have...
It's dangerous.
Shana-chan!
A phone call?
From who?
Um... it's Ms. Sakai!
I need to find her! I need to find her!
Sana! Calm down!
Are you okay, Zenjirou-san? Fine!
A tiger, a tiger is on the screen...
Then press in the sausage.
Press in the pickled plums too.
Done!
I'm heading off to find her now!
Sana-chan!
Mariko's father.
It's my fault! No, it's my fault!
Please...
Honey!
about you and I...
Mama.
While all this was happening, we couldn't decode...
It's so care-free!
Who can this person be?
Abandoning the other love...
My dearest Mama...
And Jinbou Elementary School's disciplinary chairman, Andoh-sensei!
I'm so glad.
The fact of the matter is...
A test?
The test is 3 days from today
Understood?!?
Well, lies have their uses.
Is this justice, Principal?!
Your makeup fell off.
I'll help too!
If you don't know the equation or how to...
S, Sana-chan?!
That was Sana's life of mathematics.
I have confidence in literature and such...
Aww... how sad!
Sana-chan, you're on!
Just HOW old would I be then?
It's my responsibility.
That's right...
All right, here I go!
Friendship" huh?
It's useless.
Want to go on a rampage like before?
There was still one left in my desk.
If you don't want it spread around...
Why did he go without saying all the sudden?
Hayama...
Why did you say things like that? I believed in him.
You'll make a good wife...
Woah, Tsuyoshi-kun!
Come here, come here!
My name... did someone just call me?
Hand over the teachers' make-out picture
Leave it to Sana-chan and the loud voice that she trained in Komawari!
Make-out?
I heard it for sure. A make-out picture.
You liar! You tire! You perspire!
Let me see that picture.
Oh no...
What is it?
T, this is like I'm the evil teacher in a soap opera.
Victory is mine!
But don't do this anymore.
I have officially received the make-out picture.
You tricked us!
...in order to aim for the perfect...
L, limbo!
Let's limbo! Go, go!
It'll be okay, it'll be okay.
I had everything planned out...
my love confession is on schedule
In that ordinary classroom!
but today I digress.
He was there...
The sun is setting
A bit of a true Tokyo girl, Hisae-chan and then Mami-chan!
Do you want to try too?
Oh, so pretty!
Continuing on with the story...
I was on duty when Kurosuke was born...
Want some?
Are you okay?
Let go.
All right!
feelings of that incident may come back.
A heartache doesn't go away with just an apology.
She may even hate Hayama-kun for the rest of her life.
But... I guess to Mami-chan it's not that easy.
I'm... going to go see her!
Oh come on! You forgot why you came here?
Good. Kurosuke's gonna be waiting for you.
Hm? About Hayama, do you...
I'll see you tomorrow at school!
you can't take it back.
Happy!
Happy, happy, happy, everyone's happy!
and live every day just happy, happy, happy!
Now for a model...
When he realized he did something
Hayama was suffering too, I guess...
The big tray will tip and you'll slip and slip,
but once you fall off you won't be able to get back on the tray.
I'm so pleased! Thanks!
but you can feel it.
Is he absent today?
in the park for an hour,
Hey, Mami-chan!
Err... yeah, something like that...
Sana-chan! Mami-chan! What did you draw?
I'm done,
It's the bench!
Hey, Hayama!
Huh? Rabb-
But if it's just because he drank too much water,
Hey, hey!
I brought the vet!
Well the examination went well...
Hayama...
Mami-chan, you too. Your parents are going to worry.
Why?
Please just do as I say!
...then you can hate me for the rest of my life!
Maybe I'll sing!
by ridding you...
Please don't blame it on the true kiss
She is a famous novelist.
Akito Hayama, my sworn enemy
A second grader!
Tsu, Tsuyoshi-kun!? What happened!?
N... nothing's happened at all...
Tell me anything!
Tsuyoshi-kun...
I'll try to think up something too.
but what is 'this'?
I haven't seen Aya-chan today...
She's at the clinic.
Don't bother me!
This person doesn't get it
unless you say it directly.
Tsuyoshi-kun!
in the morning gets her mad.
for a pet in an apartment!
A... Akito-kun!
It's all because you weren't thinking
If it weren't for his crying in the morning...
Do something about it!
Wanna make roast chicken?
What are you going to do?
Your big brother has a favor to ask you.
it's completely okay.
...or broken pieces of dishware.
Thank you very much!
Right here!
Am I causing trouble for everyone
Thank you very much! Goodnight!
Don't wake me up, no matter what!
Rei-kun, I'm scared!
Good morning!
who pulled the shortest straw.
No, no, Zenjirou-sensei!
Rei-kun!
I can't take this anymore!!
Hello! Is Piyoko there?
If this kind of person is Sana-chan's mother...
...Sana-chan is really impressive.
but I have come here knowing that this is the only one that will work.
For a brighter future where chickens can cry freely,
wasn't a chicken, but a pheasant.
Yes, hello?
Eh? Where?
when I passed by here during cleaning duty,
If it's school, it's a wide open space
So now then, we seem to have come to a happy ending...
a moron who never gives up!
Usual classroom
it's time to get out of there!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
Listen, Hayama, young man!
--Okay, let's go, Hayama! We're going to think positive, --Huh, me too?
--peel some skin, and find forte and foible! --What's going on here!?
"Mitsuya-sensei's worries"
What do you mean, we might not make it to middle school?
Our class is significantly behind on the lesson plan, right?
"The test is in 3 days"
Wow, the principal gave his approval for this?
However... however... if I must, I will play the ogre!
an8"Even ogres can be moved to tears"
Back then, I was quick to burst into tears,
Mitsuya-sensei...
Everyone, please look at the printout I just handed out.
Well, do you understand this?
I- it's not so much this, as all of it.
 In third grade, I took a tumble. 
 I struggled and I struggled, but even so, 
--It's not exactly your fault, Rei-kun. --Sensei! Your manuscript!
--That's right! I can just go to public school! --My feet are burning up!
But, before that, you need a little boost!
 --Base times height divided by two, when dividing fractions, flip them over,  --What's so bad about math? Whoo!
No time for that! Study! Study! Study!
Let's hang together!
Akito-kun, what did you just say?
at this point, it won't do any good.
Akito-kun...
What about it!?
Hayama...
Y- you can't... hey, you can't...! What are you planning to do with that!?
Mitsuya-sensei said you didn't have any more reason to act out.
Cut this nonsensical crap out.
You're going to make a good wife for someone.
...still have your indoor uwabaki shoes on.
Make sure you wipe the bottoms of your shoes when you go back inside.
We're finished.
Come on! Tell me!
Making out-- teachers, making out! How disgraceful! How vulgar!
I know! Now's just the right time for Burutcha!
You said you didn't have any more pictures!
A- actually, I need to talk to you.
W-well...
We will all help take care of Sana-chan's math!
You've got some snot coming out.
--Sensei!
I've got a secret plan!
to hear those words of friendship from all of you.
Thank you, Andoh-sensei!
are memories of those fun days!
Do your math, too!
Here I was worried about things, and came back in the middle of my business trip,
That's what you say about times like these.
In dire straits,
And our usual classroom...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
It means that once something is done, it can't be undone.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 25, the Sharp Pain in the Chest Saga,
Please don't be embarrassed.
let's burn the fire of love.
He is now a great manager.
Lend me some cash!
to answer me as usual.
I know you're not the kind of woman who could do something like this -
I'm sure he'll go home
This is Rei-kun!
Oh yes, I was meaning to give you this.
You money grabbing irresponsible dolt!
'Lucky Rabbit' Gapiyon?
Isn't it cute??
It's name is stupid.
I know without having you tell me!!
Okay! Since it wasn't a strike,
You're the only one who understands me.
Sana-chan! You have a visitor!
You still have something to say?
Kodomo no Omocha
I guess you'd call it the romantic side of a man.
Sumaki...
Oh! This?
...of making money with my body?
You really didn't mean it like that did you?
Sana-chan...
A person who's planning to trick me or to hurt me,
Okay. I'll work for you.
Sana-chan...
...pays good! ...around, I wonder?
It's a delicious job isn't it? It has to be a delicious job!
Rei: Did he come here to borrow money?
You forced a kiss on me...
Wow, I'm so surprised.
I've never even held Aya-chan's hand
That is the thing with the male and female
Anyway, it is the same
But are you sure that that job is safe?
Sure, sure!
What? What? What?
Even if you can trust the ex-husband,
Out where?
Zenjirou-san came and picked her up in his car early this morning.
What's going on?
I hear that you're going to take full responsibility
for the money that I lent to Ryousuke-kun.
What are we going to do??
is tonight's party.
you became Misako's child.
Boss...
Did he say ship?
Hey, it's cheap!
S... stop it with that shiny thing!
Was it really right for me to do this?
Are we still going to save her from this?
Ouch
Our weddings were getting to be rather plain...
So your debts were a fake story too, huh?
Right, Secretary?
This is the real delicious job!!
Probably...
Argh!
but today I digress.
and starting to miss you...
If he has 'aki' in his name then could it be Hayama!
That's tomorrow!
I always visit the cemetery.
The Hayama family's visit to the cemetery
Yeah...
'A little'?
Y... you just said that, Hayama-daddy!
So what do you really want to say, Hayama-daddy?
I'm going to go speak to the priest so why don't all of you go on ahead?
A very, very beautiful beauty!
But it kinda bugs me now!
They probably are!
Exactly! 'The Beauty' is in truth...
...Hayama-daddy's secret lover!
It's been over 10 years since Hayama-kun's mother passed away.
An alligator cannot get stuck on your back teeth!
Would you stick by your OWN opinions??
Hey you two!
Not good.
S... Sana-chan!
I just thought I heard the name of a girl I know.
W... what did I do?
Look! Romance is in the air!
Look, look! They were so couple-y!
I remember now!
I think that they're cold hearted...
I don't know why,
B... but even if you don't have any memories of her...
...you've heard stories from your Dad, right?
She's a very nice person...
Oh no! Oh no! Sana-chan, what do we do?
All right, Sana?
Okay, baby's luck!
This is...
Okay!
Isn't it weird?
he's a little shy!
We're still visiting.
Married?
Of course.
I know
Hey, Shiori, isn't winter great?
Is that so?
that makes me unhappy or depressed,
My baby is going to be born in October so his name will be Akito.
I see.
It seems like everything went well.
when my friend suddenly invited me.
In that ordinary classroom!
Please don't be embarrassed.
Today's incident is burning love!
Please, don't blame our relationship...
I'm impressed too!
It's just the cover.
What's wong. Rei-kun?
I run a small in that has been for 300 years at the Kusatsu hot springs.
The Elder of Mito stopped
When you look at this old lady up close, it's really rather scary...
I'm calling you! Father?
Gentlemen, we've arrived at our destination.
No matter! I have to run away!
Va, va, voom!
You're looking well!
Coming from Kusatsu in Gunma Prefecture,
And also, all those people
Hm? Me?
Sensei!
I am a little late on introductions,

your precious 300 year history would be...
Dad candidates go home
Hm? Me?
Oh, my mouth slipped. I am very sorry.
However, regardless of what the officials say...
That can't be wrong
or granddaughter for four years.
Sana-chan's house is about here
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ouch! I nearly have no hair
Poor Onda-san.
Lend me some money!
Who the heck thought of this?!
Me too...
You're going to leave Kurata-ya to Sana-chan?
Understood.

What are you doing?
Sure!

This is like...
The real live Sana-chan is sitting right in front of me!
I... I tape... e... each and e...

Because she failed at setting up an arranged marriage with you, she now...
But why?
Those are probably her intentions.
Oops! Wrong one!
Did you just bow your head?
Oh, I missed it!
I think I've heard those words before...
He doesn't have... eyes of a... human...
I've already began studying on how to become a head clerk.
I think that's still a ways away.
He was there...
I've been acting like ajerk lately...
yes it is.
Zenjirou-sensei has this idea.
It's GREEN!!
My Boyfriend is Clenched Out of Pride!
If I'm very sorry fixed everything there'd be no need for police!
Aww, it's such shock!!
Weee!!!! Rei-kun got into an accident
Sana-chan, Seisei isn't here.
Why have you been spacing out all morning?
Asako-san wouldn't go and latch onto some razzle-dazzle celebrity, right?
I'm telling you, it's just a rumor!
No, me
butbut if you two don't spend enough time together,
Rei-kun is a goon today!
I must take caution. Takuya Kimuchi.
It couldn't be.
Are you involved in a relationship just like in the drams?
Your carelessness caused an accident.
Asako-san! We need you!
He's telling you not to worry about it himself, right?
but Asako-san and Rei-kun haven't seen each other at all
Enter Famous Detective Sana Kurata!
At any rate, both of you keep an eye on them.
HHHow do you expect me to stay calm?

Oh, Kurosaki - san, you have kids?
Yup. Two of them.
I can handle most things...
Zenjirou - chan, you're the worst!
It's morning, newspaper, newspaper.
I woke up early for once...
Hayama are you in a bad mood?
Not really.
It couldn't be. He's after a picture of Hayama and me together??
If you're scared, don't go out to comment!
Nothing!
I can't let my guard down because the rest of the public...
Heh! He's not so snaky at all!
Sana - chan's acting REALLY weird.
Akito, they hung up, but it seemed like it was a call for you...
I don't want a frequent buyer card for scrubbing pads!
Not a coincidence. I got called out by Sunglasses.
It's not a coincidence.
I just made it up.

It's a panic, isn't it?
Okay, let's do it.
Put in the onion!
Dad you're good!
No, Shouko - chan! Don't touch that!
Hey! Akito is in it too!
Okay, I guess I'll autograph it then.
Oh, I see. I see.
Oh that's a bad guy that got caught for fighting...
It's because he's simple minded. That guy.
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
I may have my mind made up...
We became the merry-go-round.
I'll tell you my heart!
In that ordinary classroom!
Abandoning the other love...

Be it hot or cold you'll feel your best once you get into the Kusatsu waters!
Flowers bloom even in the hot water!
Choiyasa no choiyasa no choiyasa no sa!
so you and Sagami - kun go without me!
Let's go Sensei.
If there really is a conspiracy like Sensei mentioned...
the chief of staff
It's Katagirl - san!
Ouch!
Are you hurt at all?
I wonder if the real one came.
Come now, let us head to your rooms.
Hey you, you write Yubatake like this.
So the hot water is cooled a little bit over there...
FATHER!
I'm sorry I've been a selfish daughter.
No, no, Misako - san.
Welcome!
This is your room!
So that means that Hayama is here too?
Hello.
The landlady here called us
or Natsumi anywhere in a while...
Oh, I see.
Please have a glass.
I think you're misunderstanding something.
like a wedding speech!
Cheers!
Who's doing what now?
Even if you say so, Mr Clan Leader...
Misako has no feelings whatsoever of taking over Kurata - ya...
Sana - chan...
I might be moving to Kusatsu...
Of course!
It's the live shooting of a ski class!
this is our first time skiing.
But, what the heck are you guys wearing?
Hey, it's Hayama - kun, isn't it? Long time, no see!
slow down by making your skis into the character 'ha'.
Hey you, don't do it!
Akito! Oh no, is he lost?
This is a black diamond course.
Hey you, there's no way
What's that?!
Watch out!
We're home!
Welcome home!
and he has all the...
You are to hand over Kurata - ya to the Kunisada clan and - Wah!
Zenjirou!
Prepare yourself!
But please be sure to take care of Kurata - ya!
Mama!
If you will withdrawal your swords and go home,
Hey, it's light Sensei,
Completely unfair!
I had everything planned out...
my love confession is on schedule
We became the merry-go-round.
He was there...
"Kodomo no Omocha"
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
"A Band-Aid For the Heart?"
Aren't rabbits not supposed to drink water?
I got myself out.
Okay, I'll tell the teacher "There was a huge herd of sheep crossing the road,
Don't do that!
Huh? Why am I hiding?
Stay back...
Stay back!
Mami-chan wouldn't have screamed if you hadn't done something!
Why don't you tell your big sister about it?
Aloha. I'm Hawaii-Babbit.
I really don't know what's going on.
an8"Erevest"
Scars of the heart do not disappear over a mere apology.
Push it! Push it!
Come on, you were going to talk about Hayama, right? Come on, come on!
Mami-chan...
She said that just because you apologized,
I mean, you're not the only one who did that awful thing to Mami-chan,
which means that once water is spilled, you can't put it back the way it was,
 somehow or other, somehow or other, somehow or other, somehow or other, 
Good morning.
Mm-hmm.
Where's xxxx-chan!? Is he inside that bag!?
Now for a model... all right, there's one!
Yo, Hayama!
Or this one?
Mami-chan!
This is kind of fun, huh?
an8"Where Hayama used to be"
Hayama...
Watuh spilled does not retoin to the basin game!
Yeah, aren't they nice? I got them as gifts from New York.
Sane-yan, who are you talking to?
Er, Higashiyamato-san!
Okay, Baby's Rock!
Sana-chan, you might be able to do something about it.
There's a straw coming out of it so you don't drink too much, okay?
You can only drink as much as the straw will reach.
What?
If I put a little spiral on his tummy...!
Hayama's not here! He's playing hooky, huh?
Hayama, wait up!
--Just go and, ba-bing, bring some food to the rabbit hutch, okay? --Huh?
...and the rabbit...
"Back against the wall."
I've been waiting for an answer.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
Living is a fault!
Part of the Komawari theatre group
My ex- boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun
Really?
Oh my, I'll have to cook a special dinner!
I... It couldn't be... It couldn't be...
Waaahahaa! Together with Naozumi-kun!
that's too bad... see you later...
With my curly hair...
Sorry, I'd love to,
I know! You can come too!
It's Christmas plus a middle birthday
Yeah, Give me a little time to think about it, okay?
But you'll behave yourself there, right?
Middle birthday?
What to do, what to do, what to do, Akito-kun?!
I wonder if Tsuyoshi-kun would like this kind of thing
this is so difficult!
I wonder what kinds of things he likes?
Will he suddenly interfere with the fight?
I didn't hear about this!
When this airs, everything will heat up again!
Didn't know?
He thinks I have no problem with it
DAMN THOSE KISSING SCENES!!!
But if you think about it,
Old thief
Hayama-kun, your kiss was forced, wasn't it?
Which kiss will it be?
Are you okay with this?
Nothing really
A kiss...
It's up to him
Hayama- kun is jealous
I'm Kurata Sana! I am not Sam!
Sana-chan! You're so funny!!
Y... Yes
Japanese girls don't like kisses on the cheek?
This week's Sana-chan!
The kissing scene was on the cheek
Sana-chan! I have confidence in myself!
I'm going insane!
I may have made up my mind, but I'm still...
so turn around, boy dakara BOY
he was there!
Really, I miss you all day and all night!
Huh... easy going
You're asking for something not there
G... good morning, Sana-chan
Write, write, write whatever you want
Sana-chan is slamming on her pedals hard today
Hey Hayama!
What's that? What did you say?!
What's wrong, Akito-kun?
For your girlfriend? A Christmas present, right? Right?
How could I choose the present?
Akito
Yeah, the 25th is the real Christmas
Christmas... Christmas...
And I must be scolded by my girlfriend
Oh sorry, I'm late!
Ah no huh? Ah ok
What a Ionely Christmas Eve this will be
My name is Zenjirou, about the eve... are you free?
Kamura-kun can't come
No way! No way! No way!
Sana-chan, the party's great!
Sana-chan will be happy with anything
No, sorry for taking your time
This is not Christmas right? It can't be!
Andou Polynesian Sumire
Let's limbo the whole night!
Dance, dance, striking zone!
Sana!
Oh wow, how rare, it's a stray dog!
Come... don't be scared
Is it your child?!
Oh no I did it again...
when my friend suddenly invited me
We became the merry-go-round
but today I digress
let's burn the fire of love
part of the Komawari theatre group,
No!!!
Everyone else is in the same boat too, so...
It's wonderful to be able to fly around, but...
But if Tsuyoshi-kun gets transformed too,
Princess Sana! It's awful!
She's probably playing in the jungle out back
Isn't it?
It'll be hectic if Haya-moth gets pollen on the Queen
then... the people would lose hope!
I wonder if Princess Sana would find that funny...
This is the perfect defense!
For Aya-chan's sake, I'II...
Just because you defeat Haya-moth...
They might be like that forever
Wow, Sana-chan! They're falling down one after another!
Phew, ama-amazing!
We got it! Too great, too great!
It's only been 15 minutes, too
That's all?
But... what shall I do first?
Hey you!!
Release pollen? Only my copies and I can do that
Shit, I won't forgive you!
If you wash the pollen off of your body,
Say what?!
they never thought to take a bath
Get back here, you!
we'll draw a picture of Sana-chan, so get your paper and crayons ready!
Drawing on the left, drawing on the right...
...and then another arrow for the other eye...
...then add two wooden horses...
Jump, jump... hey hey hey!
That's not the case, folks
What, did he really say all that just now?
Sana, speaking of challenges, you must win, You MUST win!
Please kill me
I bet it would have been better if I was never born
How could it be better? You're supposed to be human!
G... grandma!
Sana-chan in prison
Hamaya, you came over!
Right, it's not the time for playing
BROKEN?!
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
I waited for his reply
but I'm still in panic!
when my friend suddenly invited me
Give up that love
In the city without fire
Oh, impossible
He is the novelist who had won QM award
His squirrel named Marlu
Haipima Akito-kun
Sana, you do not know of this
The red paper wave to and fro
What are you going to do from now on?
But it is true
This problem...
Pass the art gallery and listen to famous music
The things you just take
And all the things here will be confiscated
What is the matter on earth?
Then teacher and Sana
Mrs. Zichun, thanks for your care
We... we sure will meet again
Mrs. Zichun
I will not forget
We have nothing but a breath
May may... I stay neighbor, my name is Xin
There is happy as long as live
I never heard so sadness the clock sound
There is in the weekly
What?
Only I do not know?
Sana, what else do you want?
The plan is canceled
What do you think about the food?
But, my mother at home alone
Turn, turn
You should have sports
Though suddenly
I got your kind
Goodbye, every one
It seems that I've met you somewhere
Can you provide anything?
But I have taken a lot of things here
So noise, you will wake Cana
Wear again
Yes, yes
If it is...
Right
Then take some picture to memory
Who is it on earth
I am the younger, dance wherever I go
Don't ride that thing
Tsuyoshi-kun, it seems ready
Ban's mother
Even Sana has no job
There is more nice job waiting there
And then, go on crying
Because no matter how hard you are
Missing you
Oh, impossible
Hapima Akito-kun, my enemy and good friend
What's up?
I am forced-out
Steep tea, Rei,
I want to eat it last
Sana, I say something about the job to you
Right
What's up?
And you have asked for a week's leave
Right
You, have you thought?
The reason for canceling, too obliquity
It is very nice to meet you here
Who is the fellow on earth?
I know this point
I hope to obey her course
But I heard Sana has no any job now, yes?
What are you talking?
OK, don't so exciting
Right
Please eat my bakemeat
Forgot to leave the mouth
Rei, the day is break
Rei was strange last night
Just like common primary school, that is good
That will be good if it is true
I'm Ajihu of the ornament company
I hope you come with me
Jump here, jump there
Dance, dance hi, hi, hi
Thank you
Give away, give away. Please
Haven't you change your mind since then?
In a word, I think it is perfect now
Now, Sana has no any job, yes?
Rei you come back
But just rely on me
Sana, go to work for company like the ornament one
Maybe will be happy
About that job I...
You haven't think over anything
Rei, I can not employ you any longer, for I have no job
Go to that making company, for this chance
It is true
It seems interesting, I want to go
I have know the bad attempt
Sana looks like a cop, this week
What, decide to work?
Put up hands to decide
No, this way
If turn to that, have turned that way
Put up hands to decide
No problem
please don't be embarrassed
You can tell it accurately
Please don't blame it on the true kiss
In a city without light,
My name is Kurata Sana,
Nice to meet you, my name is Woosi
Yeah
I never heard that
Prose
If I try my best, but I still can't finish it
No, that's not so
it must be sold well
Impossible
Sagami, you're too childish
It'd be waited by 77 kinds of horrible traps
Why do you have the unwritten word?
Be quick to duck out from the horrible trap
Come here, Sana
I want to eat noodle
I'll go to the convenience shop
Sorry, I'll work tomorrow morning
Well, at first, my attention was dispersed
The propitious voice, the relaxed life
What's the matter with you, Honda-san?
You're still unsatisfied in the literary field, even the publishers
Excuse me
Which song will you sing?
Cattish man
Me too, me too...
Well, if I can explain it clearly in 50 words
Don't you feel tried?
I know you already read that book about my daughter and I
The writhing concerns the mother and her daughter of Misako
Idiot, Idiot... I'm not an idiot
There's only one day
Sana, please try your best
Be quick to do that
OK
Do you want to hide anything?
That's all
That guy still loves me, right?
It's not time to think of it
Thank you, Hayama
I have to go now
I finished it finally
I want to sleep now at once
That's so
So long
The earth is GYAK-KAITEN
is true, yes it is
You can't ignore it either
Today's incident is burning love!
My name is Kurata Sana,
It doesn't matter
Wootio Woosi will act my father in the drama
Sana
it's urgent, so I planned to stay up to finish it
No wonder, then I'm a healthy girl
It's really shameful
After you were asleep
I finished it with difficulty
It's really great
I have no time to pose
I'll subtract 20 scores
When did you become so profligate?
but you slept in the park
No doubt
How could KurataSana have father?
It's impossible!
It seems that he's just your father from these photographs
Sana is really powerful
What does it mean? The lead role is me
You're right, Lumezy
Cancan?
Put the dance in the cabinet, the householders interview
I'm back
See you, Wuwen
Are you alright?
Sana, won't your mother come to join in the householders interview?
Time of the householders interview After school is over
Are you talking about Woo? Do you mind?
Rei
There's very difficult rope in it
I love you
Does it have anything to do with Zenjirou-san?
What did he say?
In order to enter Sambo school, he's trying his best to cope his bad subject
and his brother read here either
we'll lose the admission qualification of Sambo school at the same time
You tell me you'll enter Kamen
How's it? Come, let's go to play
I want to tell you before that
If again, if again...
He's really an old man
My snot are all on my mustache
Woo, it's so warm
Wuwen...
You're really hateful
Hateful guy
What? Don't you practice Karate?
Coren'd be back
by ridding you...
I'm Kurata Sana!
Rei Sagami, my manager,
Gomi-kun, Gomi-kun, where are you going?
He'll be here from tomorrow
Yeah
That must be catsup
Shut up
No, it's because of... It's because of...
that brother are eating Sushi with face being veiled with us
We can feel the perseverance of the Theatre Troupe Komawari
I'm OK
If I was right, the educational dean of Kamen Middle School
Right
If you couldn't go back to Sambo Middle School,
Does Gomi-kun go to school?
How come his make-up lost again?
No, I didn't
He's said many times that he didn't do that
one more time it's OK
It can't be... Hayama won't steal
No. No
Jane, I heard that,
So shameful
Mum will...
Mum
Hayama is not good that
Give it to me. Give it to me
that Hayama stole something
I've no choice
It's time for shooting
Oh, Hayama, I totally believe you
Hayama? It's strange
I did something wrong to Hayama I did something wrong to Hayama
Hey, are you Jane?
Dad is very busy now
Sorry
We'd made an apology to the boss just now
Are you still angry with Gomi-kun?
in this way, for five hours
Convenient very is it
Gomi-kun didn't go to school all the while,
Don't trouble Hayama
you can't go to Sambo Middle School
It's used for self-defense Wanna try?
Hayama
Think about it
Raise your hands and make a decision
When you're calm you always get a shock
My dearest Mama is an Aoki Award winning author
Do I catch a cold?
I won't give chocolate randomly this year. C16, are you making it also?
I see. Sister, aren't you?
How lucky that Sana is slow!
Hisae-san is a little bit strange
When Sana declared the affairs of Wootio and here
None of our business
Kurata often give out chocolates randomly
Kurata
It's a kind of successful feeling
OK, that's it
She left
only yours can make me happiest
Woo didn't come today
We don't need this kind of actor who left his work randomly
He has formed the hobby of leaving the work aside from earlier
Sana
OK, cancel the next part of Woo
Forget it. Well
OK, it's starting
Everyone is waiting for you now
The tramcar is an express one
Who knows!
Listen, the director is a kind man
Then next
I'd like to listen to the sound of the sea
Do you know?
I recall the feeling when I was in the stomach of my mother
Woo
Banchi
How about it? That's it this time
Whose watch is it?
turns out like that every time
But,
I,
and went to American alone.
I learned nothing
I, who failed in acting and cultivating, really feel regretful
And the man,
has gone nowhere.
Take out the jumping box at the P.E. Class
I hope you can get yourself together
Woo, happy Valentine's Day Though it's a day earlier
Woo, Woo, I like you
Let's go back, Woo
Driver, please drive at the speed of 800 km
Woolgathering is just like thinking of nothing
To live, there must be things waiting ahead
It's been the eighth time
Isn't it vacant?
who cares nothing
How kind is Kurata!
Great. Thank you
I want it, too. I want it, too
Good things aren't major The major things aren't good
Raise your hands and make a decision
Then go on crying
KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI
Ah... never mind, never mind
I am Ultra Relaxed!
first year middle school student
Those who are chosen out please don't be afraid
I'm daughter of Misako Kurata
Come on, it's very cheap
Your first essay comes into the market
Are you classmates of Sana?
Are you Hisae-san?
Because I know very well how hard-working Sana is
Hisae-san
Aren't you Aya-chan?
Rei, is the motorcycle borrowed from your friend?
Yeah
may be cancelled
Oh?
But I accepted an film notice
You wrote nothing about her on the book
and fly to her home at the utmost speed
may forgive me
Low taste, deduct 120 scores
OK, I see
an unforgettable feeling
I hope it's forever if it's possible
I...
What should I say to her?
It's strange to say sorry
Didn't you find that Sana is very strange?
I've got a film notice
and I'll take bus at 8am from Little Sin to Eighth Yu Mount. Scenic spot
Sure
The Eighth Yu Mount. Is snow mountain now
The magic ball is coming
Work hard. Work hard
shoes, underwears...
My heart is bumping all the time
Last time I escaped from the reality
I think perhaps kids can make it
because you have privilege
Sana has gone back just now
You forgot your watch
Really?
Mami-chan, please listen to me
Please listen to me, I...
Sorry
Woo, no problem
What? What?
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
I always feel Relax,
I'm Kurata Sana, a TV personality with Gekidan Komawari, and 6th grader.
You got me.
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Yeah! Yeah!
yak it up and dawdle around during cleaning time.
--What was that!? --What was that!?
What!? Get her!
Mm-mm, but still, I'll be fine.
You mean this?
Say, what is "this"?
Thanks, Aya-chan.
Eh!? Tsuyoshi-kun!?
Why not? After all, Tsuyoshi-kun is in the nurse's office!
How about we cook it up and eat it?
Never mind you, Akito.
Bawk, bawk, bawk.
What?
Is it okay if Piyoko stays over at my house?
Well, you can give them corn, and seashells, and broken china.
They really eat this sort of thing?
My parents have a farm back in Higashimurayama,
Maybe you are.
Ta-da! In here, the atrium that Mama built for fun.
Maybe I'll just live here with Piyoko.
Turns out I drew the shortest straw of them all...
Awtists are nevuh unduhstood, huh?
What!? It's making me self-conscious
No, no, Zenjiro-sensei, even if he is a rooster,
You never learn, do you?
I can't take it anymore!!
You can't!
Huh?
Then, it was because of Piyoko?
Really!?
Huh!! Where!?
They say that chickens will take three steps
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...panic!!
...up to now, just for today,
so BOY, take a look my way!
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
A little more acceleration at night
Then you'll pull away!
The mysterious white bat! Babbit here
But I seldom speak to him recently
This is my publicized lover
Oh, crap. Oh, crap
with you
Good. Let's stay here forever
Wootio
Didn't the landlord say that?
we've to leave here
Genius advance borrower
Yeah. Yeah. Ask Ms Zichun to come back tonight
Be quiet and listen to me
Sana, what's up?
Now I'm homeless
As you said that
No. Not good
Go to Sister Machi
Woo
Sana, Sana
I want to talk. I want to talk
It's good for your health
But could you let me have a look?
You're wrong. We're coming to investigate one thing
Don't care so much
Do I need to investigate it?
OK
will be bad for your fame?
Really? Sana
Excuse me
Is there anything good to be his fan before he become famous?
The flowing water is babbling The flowing water is babbling
Take out the jumping table at the P.E. Class
I'm very nervous
I think he must be very handsome
Let's wait and see
Shut up!
Sana seems have looked on it as her own home
Annoying! Sana
Woo, here are the guests
The whole body turns stiff
11 degree It's the right time to drink it
Hold the cup
Time for barbeque
Hayama
We're going back
Two odd fish
The fans club dismissed after three hours
But is that guy really Sana's boyfriend?
Thank you for picking me up
Eh...
You, you, what did you say?
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
I'm always relaxed
Every time changes to be so
At last,
Stay here all my life,
I think it's better to go back for me
You're marvelous, really!
Her name is is Cathy
He always named the woman Cathy
is Sana's father?
Go on if you want to say! Anything is ok!
Abhorrent, let me show you my vileness since you say so
Abnormal!
I heard from the landlord that
Who Wootio Woosi affiliatied with at that time is this missy
Cathy?
Yeah!
run out quickly from the behind door
Good morning!
Who is she waiting for?
Good news? What is it?
It's good chance for him to be popular
Woo is sure to be happy
Don't worry, it absolutely won't happen
I'm thinking that we finally can see Woo happy
Woo, it's really you!
Look, you're sick as long as I'm not beside you
OK!
Sorry, Cathy
Woo lives alone,
and doesn't eat well, which makes him unhealthy
Is it so?
You, what likes an old guy is really same as Sana
You looks tired! Take a good rest!
That's not the problem
I ask you to imitate dogs to shout just now?
Zenjirou-san, you are a chatty bad friend!
Stop!
It's over!
It's the topsy-turvy drama's new scenarios
Phone number?
Are you here to womanize?
Thank you, Sana
so I have to...
It's good, Woo. Congratulations!
This it is
Dad
It's raining
Annoying, annoying, annoying...
Sensei, she let that man freeload in her home
Sagami
Woo
If it'd change this way, it's been this way
Take care. See you!
Tomorrow's tomorrow is full of light
Hard-won happiness comes to you
What I said is nothing wrong
You're sure to get fruits if you work hard
You, how can you stay away?
Stomach prolapses?
How would the stomach prolapse for eating watermelon?
That's for you just to let you keep the secret
He is really seriously sick?
Really?
Yeah, if me, I will be unruliness
Isn't that man still alive?
Sana, what's that?
You don't permit to do that again
It's not so easy to get so good role
You must keep acting hard
Like a dream
This wish is sure to realize
Good daughter, it's time to go school
You must come again, good daughter
We will stay together for ever, Woo
Snakes shouldn't wear shoes when coming in
Why did Woo die?
Because...
But now Mr. Wootio is in hospital
You, idolt!
Mr. Wootio, you must think more about the following work
I understand you feeling now
No...
Rei
You are marvelous, former boyfriend
She hasn't kissed my cheeks for a long time
Really? Just as usual?
So...
Prepare well for the golden continuos drama
I have something to tell you
Really?
Today sets for tomorrow
We have tomorrow forever
Nice to meet you
What will Haki do after seeing the sick? He will betray himself soon
I can't believe such things will happen
Kurata...
I think your life is sure to be anticlimax
You can't be mentioned in the same breath, never!
Then I am fine
You are right
Woo, you've just recuperated, so maybe you'll feel a bit difficult
Are you ok?
Start!
The show is sure to be resounding
Dad!
I did at last
You can't die
Everything is OK. No problem
And you'll feel energetic
This doesn't work
If it'd change this way, it's been this way
End with laughing. Excuse me
It's alright. It's alright
The heart is at ease
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
When you're calm you always get a shock
One step different from being relaxed
Simply singing for a relax
It's good that we can meet you
Dad... Dad...
I hope our class...
Would you be quiet now?
I have thought over
But, I can't eat again
Yes
But she don't know she may cry
Hei! You haven't eyes?
Soul?
Sorry, I don't want to dance today
You come back finally.
I came here rushed specially for the bit time
If the actor is too stupid
Someone said he have pink news with a little girl
I think he call...
He is Wootio
I can't forgive, Woo
Come on
I want to be together with Woo
So, I take the train
But what do I do?
Then how to go?
It's cold
It's no way
If you go elsewhere, D256 it's OK
Why, why?
The local report that there will be snowslide near the top of the mountain
Stool
Like sweetie
Don't give up! Fight to the last ditch
I don't know too, how do you think of it? Mami-Chan
How about you? Hayama
Hayama he... Hayama, he lost.
Although it isn't my mistake
What?
Sana she...
Yes
I... I want to play a stage pose
No matter if you are be here or aren't be here, please answer me.
If we can live...
Woo, are you Ione?
Sorry
Kurata
Where is here?
Sana, Sana
Can you listen?
Sana
There are so many people who watch
I'm fine now
So...
So... Sorry, Mom
I'm Kurata Sana
Hayama, my diehard follower and best friend
Now he also is my benefactor
That doesn't work
If it'd change this way, it's been this way
The heart is at ease
Bitter feelings are really strange and dizzy
He is trying to be the best broker
I talk you, you will become old if you like anger
Your hair is felted
So he never touch my lip
Don't think bad, please
Yes, it's Hayama's question
Indeed, she also took a photo about Sensei touched chest and bullied he
It's friendship
Yes, Friendship
His word is good, Hayama
Yes, yes.
Hayama
What? What are you talking with me?
Mitsuya-Sensei, He...
I can't accept!
Don't do bad
Touch chest?
Well, About text strength
It take three days to remedy it, it's impossible
The idea is really right
But, I can't give up now
Anten-Sensei
your friendly words
If you said you have the photo about he touched chest for me
Please wait Please wait for a moment
Add four, four beans
This is Sana's ikon's song
Oh, The accounts for the milk in the coconut, Aya-Chan...
I'm shame-making
Brachium tightly, hand fist
Well, That's this
The media transferred project
and same as your tusk become stickup
I also act with you
It's present you gave me
Not bad
The act you happened at moment
I was D484 kissed again
Finally... Finally...
Look, Look
The heart is at ease
This doesn't work
I'm always relaxed
Experiences must surely be a lot
Good morning, Shimura-san!
Good morning, Sana-chan. Late today?
It was a dream?!!
Sana-chan! What are you doing, why are you so slow?!!
I hope this will be a very interesting book that reveals nothing
Ah! Sana-chan! Let's take a picture of you in your school uniform. Do a pose!
Sensei, your expression looks scary
I'm Kurata Sana, 12 Years old, I'm an actress.
But the TV station asked me to come, and the producers told 'me' to come
Shinohara, let's sing!
It makes people so nervous...
Really
Really? I don't see it
...to watch everyone from the side wearing junior high school uniforms...
Hey, that's Kurata Sana-chan, isn't it?
Oh, I don't know who's taking pictures of who
If you walk around Tokyo you'll see celebrities
This is Fuka, another new friend
I'm the big brother of the Jinbou Elementary School Principal, Ari
Excuse me, please find the differences between the two I'll give you 15 seconds
Wait principal! That was so short!
The brothers are so much alike. It's so much fun
Um... ok
Everyone's classmates, Sana-chan doesn't want you to treat her differently.
Is that so?
How can it be? I have be on a cooking show. They called me Little Diner Sana!
No, no, no, only a friend and mortal enemy! I'm gonna introduce you to him
Then I don't want to meet him now
Tsuyoshi-kun, don't talk. Aya-chan, what's going on?
He must come from another elementary school
That's right. It looks like he just came out of karate
Oh yeah!
Hurry up and stop fighting. You can't fight on the first day of school!
He's the one that started it
Ahh Akito-kun also agrees. This isn't the right time to say stuff like this
This is the first time I made someone's nose bleed. I have mixed feelings.
Why did you fight with him, eh?
Back then when I was going home...
Not really, I don't think that's too stressful
Nothing's changed, still loves to sing
She speaks with a western accent...
In other words, looks really cute!
Where is Sana?
No such thing??
No... I don't realize I was sleeping
How do you do?
Everything is OK! OK!
If this song you sing is trouble then it's Bye, Bye, Bye...
Really that's ridiculous...
Watch all this too...
If it becomes dense... Really becomes dense...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye...
Then you'll pull away!
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
He's the person who stole my first kiss!
Get away, bra-less.
Like this! Do you understand?
That happened in kindergarten.
How can it have ruined your life? That's ridiculous.
it is very ridiculous, you idiot!
Fuka, cool down.
So Fuka and Hayama went to the same kindergarten?
I remember when I was talking about it with my friends...
Actually... I've already had my first kiss!
I was waiting for him to tell me that he liked me.
But I'm pure!
In these 3 years, I will get my revenge.
Hey Aki, listen, listen!
I'm really happy to be in middle school!
But I guess Hayama really is a kiss devil.
The other half a year, I barely get by.
Wait, wait...
Haven't seen you all day... Uh...
Hmm? What do you wanna say?
You make people angry.
See ya later, kiss devil!
That's all you wanted to say?
Akito-kun... homeroom has already started.
He looks like he's in a really bad mood...
What?
Hayama, you brat!
I hoped you'd keep the peace...
Are you mesmerized by Hayama? I so adore him!
Wow!
Here...
My gymnastics isn't bad.
Don't yell in the cafeteria.
You keep bringing up these things that are way in the past.
The scars on women's hearts are the enemies of women.
I'm sorry Fuka.
Uh... yeah... I'm alright.
If it's not ready, we'll ad-lib!
Sana-chan, this isn't a variety show.
You grew up.
I was surprised to hear that you were in middle school already.
That's not it, but you grew up.
Really?
But... but... when he was...
Hairy caterpillar Hayama
Jerk!
That poor girl is crying!
If this song you sing is trouble then it's Bye, Bye, Bye...
But your heart is in no mood...
Your body has no energy...
Decide to lift your spirits...
When you're calm you always get a shock
Octopus sausage?
I am Kurata Sana and this is my costume, octopus sausage.
Maybe Hayama has comedy potential and she noticed it!
What are you talking about?
Sana-chan, you haven't decided on the clothes yet!
Today's field trip is a chance for Akito-kun...
This is a good chance for them to be together.
See, it's bloody. It's starting...
Who said that?
Yo!
Huh!
Who am I?
I guess so.
Yeah, that's right.
Is it okay to have monkeys hanging on you?
Don't you need to prepare first?
What kind of movie is it?
Ono Mikio is very famous, isn't he?
Really? You're the main character of this movie, right?
Scene change.
Are there lions here?
Don't do anything or else I won't forgive you!
You're interested in weird things again.
I have Octopus sausage.
Are you really as dense as this...?
That's right, his feelings for Sana-chan... he likes you
The truth?
Yeah... there was something like that.
That was a mistake... When I realized it...
even if I think he likes me, I could be mistaken again...
Didn't I already say that I didn't know?
Yeah.
Not seeing each other will probably be lonely...
Ghost? I'm one...
Why are you getting so mad over what I said?
Don't talk to me!
At sixes and sevens.
So that's the story... Farewell!
Naozumi-kun is playing a normal kid.
Everyone... the press conference has started...
Seriousness... ness... ness...
A little more acceleration at night
Even shining heads go pir pir!
Hiroto played by Kamura Naozumi.
My heart is on fire!
But it was empty to begin with so I didn't have to bother.
You're asking me how I feel? I don't feel anything special!
How should I know?
But I heard from the producer... Naozumi-kun's role is more important.
That was scary, he's like a ghost himself.
When the set is ready, we're going on location in the mountains where the
But she can't come back for a while.
Snan later... 
She's no longer doing this...
But... I thought you didn't have karate today.
Encoded, timed and edited by Sanaaki
It's ghost!
Yeah, I'm leaving next week.
You won't be coming back for two months?
Hayama, you'd feel better if you'd just say what's on your mind.
Sana-chan is leaving this week... Hayama is so...
Did you give me this?
I was just a fan before...
Hey says he loves me... l'll feel very guilty if I refuse without a reason...
If he knows, I'm doomed! I was about to go home, what are you doing?
But it's all right, right?
Will you be lonely?
Ok, next.
Since we won't be able to see each other for a long time, I'm calling...
I'm ok, thank you.
Bye, Aya-chan, I'll see you after two months.
Sana-chan, don't just make phone calls,
We're leaving very early tomorrow.
Eh?
I'll take the bus with everyone else.
Naozumi-kun, good morning, good to see you.
You passed the test?
Congratulations, this is great, Hayama.
What is it?
...Is this really true?
To a child, two or three months...
Here goes the usual time skein...
Crying again after another loss...
With everyone together saying
Mysterious white bat Babbit Keto baba in Indonesian.
Matsui Fuka, best friend I met in the bathroom with an Osaka accent.
Kurata.
Incredible! Incredible!
Is that a frog
Sign: Rei's feelings.
When she's walking on the street, people can still recognize her.
Come on!
I don't have time to stay here with you
You mean I should work harder on the sex scene with Kawai-san?
Ah... I mean, yeah, this is your job. Kurumi-san, it's going to start soon...
Kurmi-san?
I'm here
Where?
Stop being so foolish and come down here quickly
It's like people always say, use love to make me higher and higher.
Hiroto, lie down right there.
The sun-light is here.
What do you want to say?
I didn't have too much time myself.
That's right, nothing at all
Eh? That means...
What's WA hA hA?
And this is my picture!
Is it
To be despicable is the rule of winning
What are you talking about? I don't have any secrets.
Yes! Don't ever tell anyone else
They do have feelings for each other, take a picture.
Where am I?
Do you understand?
What what, what do you want? Naozumi-kun
I...
But your heart is in no mood...
Your body has no energy...
If it becomes dense... Really becomes dense...
At this rate, you'll be first!
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
it's time to get out of there!
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
--"Lend me money!" --"Lend me money!"
You've got a bad habit of doing that.
Hey, Rei-kun, shake it off! Hey, hey!
Is that all?
I know, you don't have to say it! Even so, even so, even so,
Ex-husband? Ah, I read about it in that book.
Click...
Are you okay, Zenjiro-sensei?
--There's shua to be a better job coming alawng... --Sana-chan, you have a visitor!
an8"Who is the visitor?"
I wonder who it is. Who could it be?
Lend me some money?
Say, isn't that Namuro Amie over there!?
so could you please not stare at everyone?
Very far be it for you to tell me now.
And before that, I probed into space, looking for UFOs!
Sumaki?
...make prints with, and then sell them with my autograph, or something?
You want to use me, and keep it a secret from Mama and Rei-kun?
No, that wasn't my intent.
--to do some work for me. --and not too bright, and-- Huh? Woik!?
Let's do it! Let's see this through!
Leave it to us!
--Rei: "You bastard!" --This is gonna let me get lawts of pretty goils.
Think about it.
H- how are you able to make that assertion, huh!?
Who are you to be saying something like that?
shameless grade-schooler, aren't you!?
--all kinds of things. --But Hayama is such a stupid jerk... --When you find your opening, you...
--That's true.
You're worried, which is why you're telling us this.
S- sure...
Welcome, Kurata Sana.
Did you mean to say "cute" and "sexy"?
Despite how it looks, I am a businessman.
Those guys are carrying pistols, right?
Fight, you guys!
Yo, yo, groom, I'm so jealous, you dog!
That's my idol.
Ryosuke-kun is not such a bad person. I guarantee it.
Y- you think so?
--The Yen Shop, Secret Organization.
But he wasn't a bad person.
And our usual classroom...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 28, the "Who is that Beauty at the Gravesite Visit?" saga,
Eh? Is there anything I want?
...a love letter to your... boyfriend? But she didn't write anything
This Sunday, five or six friends from Osaka want to come to hang out with me...
It's you who destroyed my relationship with Takaishi-kun...
I want him to feel how it is...
No need...
Sushi?
Fuka-chan and Sana-chan look alike, don't they?
If I promise something, usually doesn't come through.
Sushi! No problem!
Haven't seen you in a while... How've you been?
That girl...
Haven't seen you guys in a while! How are you!?
Long time... no see...
Hayama-kun...
Stop staring at me, it makes me uncomfortable...
That's Osaka.
Maybe... she's also a fake...
It can't be...
You're not feeling well?
I don't know, you decide.
I don't feel good... This is different from being unhappy?
Kele Cake!
I'll have curry steak then
The fries are good. The steak burger is not bad either
That's why people said you had a boyfriend, right?
I did say I had my first kiss...
Then the rumor about a boyfriend...
What did you say?!
Don't worry, Shizu-chan...
Ok, we'll all meet here after we're done shopping.
Then... why are you crying?
Because of you, I didn't feel as bad as I should
It's Sana...
That's the only way I could get her to send a postcard.
Tomorrow we'll work hard too. Good night!
I wonder if Fuka has gotten the postcard yet.
Here goes the usual time skein...
Eh? Maybe very stupid
But if you're depressed, don't give up...
At this rate, you'll be first!
No problem
When you're calm you always get a shock
Bababababa!
Matsui Fuka, the girl I met in the bathroom!
Matsui, I still have feelings for you...
It's over.
It's really a good morning day!
He also lured me into the film-acting world.
it's just like that!
Yes.
What's this hand doing?
Ok, no problem
I'm used to Asako's love scenes
See you. Hurry and rest.
ask your teacher.
As long as she's ok, I'm ok. It matters here.
Do you understand child's love? Don't you want to ask her about it?
That's right!
But Rei-kun doesn't agree.
as important as shape!
A bra... Sana-chan stay a young girl
Hey, this one's not bad. Ok!
Where?
Ok! Good work!
Why?
We've always been his fans, he's our life.
Are you guys local natives?
We've discovered Zenjirou's new lover...
What the hell is this!
What are you talking about 'please'?
But he and I are only classmates and coworkers, that's it
The sun's ready to set, we should go home now.
But... But?
If we don't say it, it'll never be obvious.
What's wrong Sana-chan?
Let's go!
I always turned so cold toward the people I like.
Personal relationships are very difficult to deal with
What's he saying?
Sana-chan's manager Sagami-san!
Sorry.
A little bit jealous?
Yeah, just a little
Don't be too upset that I can't really take care of you.
I have something to tell you
Start talking to others...
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
My manager, driver, Rei-kun. He's also my ex-boyfriend.
Ah...
I'm sorry, Sana-chan I should've kept my guard up...
Let's continue.
What does that mean?!
I didn't mean it like that...
It'll be fine, I can do it
But I'm just saying what if...
I don't care what you say! I won't agree! No!
Rei-kun, I don't want to give my part to someone else.
She spent a night in the clinic last night.
Rei-kun, am I heavy?
I'm alright!
Sorry for making you all worry!
He's really sorry that his fans hurt you
Boom! Pow! Slam! Bang! A physical attack!
Are you alright?
Yeah.
Leave me... just go!
Not even the PHS phone works
This the front of the movie set.
Welcome!
Sana-chan, Ok!? Ok...
Scene 61: Mako and Hiroto scene.
Are you ok, Sana-chan?
It sounds like it hurts a lot... And it left a big impression
OK
They said their emotions got out of control and made them do that
There's no point in apologizing to me
There's no point, you don't have to
No, it happened before...
Because she had a relationship with Naozumi-kun, she turned me down
What he meant was look at his eyes... but we know what you meant
Me and my Osaka friends discussed it...
Really I'm relieved now
Will you be... my real boyfriend?
If this song you sing is trouble then it's Bye, Bye, Bye...
Crying again after another loss...
Really that's ridiculous...
It's alright! It's alright!
Your body has no energy...
When you're calm you always get a shock
I'm always relaxed
It's a different now
Will you be my real boyfriend?
Huh? How strange.
If you're gonna say that, it's okay.
It's person I can't see again even thought I really want to.
I keep remembering about you, Hayama.
Are you okay?!
But...
but...
Umm actually...
Hmm?
Naozumi-kun! Can I blow your trumpet?
Hey! Sana-chan's on TV, look!
I'm so jealous Akito. If you just sit there Sana-chan will be taken...
How is everyone? Is Fuka well?
There's a lot of things on my mind
Ah, I'm just kidding. So keep doing well.
I hurt my leg.
I'll ask him later.
Eh?
Sagami-san bring Sana-chan here please.
Thank you Asako-san!
The phone somehow works and I got through to you.
Hey! Are you listening?
Fuka, is she OK?
Sana-chan
Sana-chan! Sana-chan! What's wrong Sana-chan?
Nope.
I looked like such at idiot.
Naozumi-kun calm down!
Rain, rain, how painful. Sign: So He Calmed Down
They're going out now.
What secrtesupon?
Stop it already! Please stop!
I get turned down.
Today it's raining raining raining
But Sana-chan, who could even do an abult's job,
It's not that hayama-kun is bad, or anybody is bad.
Mama, I'm making everybody worry about me.
Really... enough...
For you Sana-chan...
I'll always be there for you Sana-chan!
So don't cry, don't cry.
Here goes the usual time skein...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
It's alright! It's alright!
It's alright! It's alright!
Your mere words show you agree...
Decide to lift your spirits...
I am Ultra Relaxed!
One step different from being relaxed
With everyone together saying
Mysterious white bat Babbit.
I'll do anything... for you. Ouch.
Sana-chan?
That's too bad. You were only a bit close to winning!
Please rest well tonight!
Goodnight...
But this time she really lost her spirit.
And we also need to prepare for the shot two days after tomorrow.
Even so...
Oh yeah! Cake attack!
Well, no, I didn't think...
Least expecting Who could that be?
I think it's coming this way!
Who would have expected...
Over there are presents I've brought.
Wow! There's even shellfish1
Go and bring Sana's stuff down!
Let's go. Sagami-san!
I've already taken so many days off and given everybody so... so much trouble
The thing about Hayama is still 'banging around' my head.
Wow! There's mini-octopus, sausage, and tempura prawns!
That's why you need to face them and stand up to them.
That is, 'Obana! ' Waa! Haven't woken up feeling great in a long time!
That HURTS!
You sat on my leg and it hurt! And I was having such a nice time sleeping too
So I have decided to doze off a bit more. Good night again!
Mm... What's the poor Onda-san doing now. Let's go see for ourselves!
You seem to be up for some fun, Naozumi-kun!
I'm so uncomplicated!
I say, this person trusts you. Look he's waiting for you in tears!
Onda, you need to protect these manuscripts really well. Is it really?
Mmm? What is this?
Sensei is too mean!
How about that?
Ah! That forest!
Feels like a long time ago.
Oy! Naozumi-kun!
Preparing for tomorrow's act.
Everyone contributed so much into this movie for me.
For the sake of the audience, people are united as a team.
What?
Something seems to be wrong with sensei's helicopter.
Sana-chan, are you alright? I was worried!
Yeah, I was planning to do it.
Eh?
Director!
I think it's about time to go back, right, Onda?
I'll take a picture now.
Good luck with your writing!
Mama, thank you. I'll work hard.
Sana-chan. It's about time to get started!
Extinct... fame? What's that?
At this rate, you'll be first!
Yay, yay, yay, yay...
It's alright! It's alright!
Start!
Here and there! All catching fire!
Sparks are shooting everywhere! Everywhere is shooting sparks!
Signal is his name. Did you know that?
Four, three, two, one. Zero!
Sana-chan, hurry and come out.
The temperature is rising and on top of that there's smoke.
It looks like I have to call Rei-kun on the... wireless.
I feel horrible, like I'm dying.
Here's your ice cream!
Don't play with your food!
We don't have the budget!
Big brother?
How, Mako...? Unless... you set the fire?
So live.
Cut, OK!
OK? OK?
Tell the firefighters to hurry up!
Sana-chan! Naozumi!
Sana-chan!
Ahh! Naozumi!
If I sing the song the burn will get better.
Don't sing, it sounds horrible.
Anyway the location shoot is finished.
It's fine! But...
I hate this director.
all you guys like Naozumi-kun, right?
have somebody I like.
After saying it, press the button.
Hello, Sensei!
I can't believe you drove that in here!
Summer, huh?
Everyone is finishing homework.
Long time no see.
Right!
Have you told anyone about you coming back?
No, I haven't told anyone.
I don't think anyone knows that I came back.
When I went to do the movie it was May,
The cakes looked like this!
Just when I went to school, I skipped school
This is the way of living in the mountains.
I finally found a place I could use the phone
Crying again after another loss...
Yo Fuka!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
As usual, I'm feeling great!
Yo.
He said he's a super growing machine...
...at night, his body makes noises.
Scary growing machine.
Do you look up to me? Sanaaki: As in "admire".
All of them?
You've worked out all the numbers...not willing to be taken advantage of!
...in the final exam, she had the ninth highest mark in our grade.
Sign: Because Hayama is also there?
...are you two going out?
Did someone tell you?
Sensei, you shouldn't run in the hall!
That scared me.
What are you doing? Big pervert!!
What is isumomi? Translated by Sunny and Al.
Before that!
Anyway, you shouldn't call me by my first name...
Thanks.
Say Fuka-san...
Managed to dodge it...really!
You'd have to wait a million years before you can start talking about men.
So, stop talking about this stuff.
Sign: Dying It's your own fault.
Hello, everyone. I'm Kurata Sana, from Class 8.
Fuka really is perfect.
...they say she placed third in competition.
So...
Sorry!
I'm so tired...
I answered "fine with me".
Akito-kun, what about Sana-chan?
She's so slow. Sanaaki: think he's talking about Sana here.
Akito, be like Tsuyoshi-kun and just button them.
What are you doing?
When Sana is upside-down like this, she can't stop...
Too late.
That's right. Aren't you the one putting a wall up?
Wait a sec, what do you mean?
...if we were here, we definitely wouldn't have allowed it!
That was because he was stalking me. I had to find an excuse.
...and we couldn't get in touch with you either...
Aki
This "script" was written as an aid - a hybrid of mostly Chinese and some Japanese translations so discrepancies will exist...
Naozumi-kun is on television...
...there will be discrepancies so take it all with a grain of salt...
Oh yeah and please don't take it and claim it as your own either...Thanks!! Translated by Al. Encoded, timed, edited by Sanaaki.
I am Ultra Relaxed!
Well... I guess they don't know...cause I didn't say anything.
An uncomfortable atmosphere at the burger shop.
What's with that girl?
But Sana-chan's situation is different...
What are you talking about?
...but you still haven't given it back to me yet...
...and once in a while we meet at the convenience store...
Why are you running away again?
In short, even after dating two months...
I began to think he's a pretty nice person...
Was it a good thing to ask him "Will you be my real boyfriend?"
Maybe in the beginning ...
Maeda-san!
Sana-chan!
Now you've seen it.
Why is this so dense?
If anyone see this...
Go?
Yes!
This week's Sana-chan.
Really?
but...
But this is a live broadcast...
This is just juice!
Anyway I think of this as just a little joke...you can forgive me right?
No way...
If you don't go to work, you've gotta go to school!
...he doesn't talk much.
What a surprise for you to come in so early.
And who was it that saw you off when you went on the location shoot?
Who is it? Who is it?
Who can it be?
Ah, they look like little carrots!
What...what's wrong?
I have to hear it from you...I'll only believe you!
On next episode of Kodomo no Omocha...episode 65
That thing that you always take out.
What?
But...
Really you feel that way about me...
I realized that I liked him in the mountains where I was shooting...
Why are you sneezing at a time like this?
The most idiotic way to end a business in Japan. How great!
Sana.
Mama.
What's going on with this draft? It's only half way done!
And, I heard that even if I have too much absences, I'll pass the grade if I pass the tests.
Yeah, that's right.
Is that true?
I'll feel so lonely...
Did you mean the show?
Sweet dreams...sweet dreams...
Be strong...be strong.
Hi, Hayama.
When you're feeling, I will always smile to you...
I don't want any past... But I won't cry for yesterday...
...or future... But I won't cry for yesterday...
It's a lonely way...
What are you doing?
It's Sana-chan!
Eh?
Since I couldn't stand seeing the two of them together...
This kid can really sleep!
That jerk focuses on me. It makes me angry.
...but Sengoku-sensei is a bit scary, too.
Hey Fuka-chan...does Sana-chan still come to school sometimes?
So I don't get to talk to her much.
Really? That means we probably won't see much of her in the future.
Akito...
Ah! Akito, wait a moment.
Just now, Akito-kun's glare looked frightening ...
Babbit knows.
Mine? My birthday is December 24th, on Christmas Eve.
Next time in Child's Toy Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 66...
There came a letter
Amazing white bat Babbit.
Episode 66: Run Away, Run Away, Across the Ocean.
...but that's all I can think about.
I'm gonna have to switch you.
This is what it means to be trapped.
What are you doing?!
It's here, it's here.
I want to know more...
Let's summon up all the energy and keep working.
...I thought I could forget everything if we don't see each other...
I just don't know what else to do anymore.
Ok? Hurry! Ok? Hurry!
Huh?
Why did he avoid the topic?
Sana-chan's movie "Mizu no Yakata" is premiering tomorrow.
There's some curry there.
Even though you're going out with someone else.
Great! Sana-chan's name came out before Naozumi-kun's.
The mail box is here, here.
...is for Sana-chan...
Sign: Cinema control room The stars of the movie must greet the audience at the premiere.
Studying English?
Sana-chan's name is on there too.
That's not that easy to find.
English letter? Leave everything to me. It's too easy.
Talandalu is in Japan to shoot another commercial.
Th...This is...
This is great news!
It looks like you are.
One's also been sent home.
These are Mr. Hamilton's requirements.
I knew that you'd have a great chance like this!
This is a great honour.
Sorry, please tell them I'll go back to school soon.
I'm still thinking about him...
This is something an ordinary girl wouldn't be able to dream of...
Why?
...my surroundings are changing quickly...
...things that are important to me are disappearing slowly.
I can't believe it myself.
This won't take long...
Simple streets.
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
Yeah.
Shut up.
My birthday means the scent of incense.
Oh?
 Jingle joyous Christmas Eve, 
I think Christ-sama's birthday is on the 25th.
Never mind!?
Now, now, Sana-chan,
Not at all.
I'm all excitable, and a little bit of a chatterbox, and all...
that is to say...
so you all go on ahead.
--Okay.
I wound up missing out on hearing about Beautiful.
I've got it! I'll bet Beautiful is really Father Hayama's secret lover!
Father Hayama is in love-love!
Sensei is currently writing a romance novel,
so she has been bringing love-love into everything she sees!
Then, right now, Father Hayama really is...
Not really.
You can't get an alligator stuck in your back teeth.
That couldn't be.
Doesn't it though?
--It's absolutely not. --...that was so funny when that happened!
It sure was.
too suspicious-- an eruption of suspicion!
It's Watson-kun! Why don't you read the novel!?
Oh, no, I thought I heard the name of a girl that I know.
Ah, this dust. I'm wearing contacts, and all...
That was terrible, Zenjiro-san!
Bingo!!
That was totally love-love!
--I don't know what your father is thinking, --that has terrible strawberry parfait!
Oh, it's Beautiful! Is that one of Mother Hayama's old photo albums?
She was one of Mom's friends. That explains why I remember seeing her.
This is more dangerous than anything, sir.
Hayama, what about you?
Really?
You finally got over being a chicken-and-egg dum-dum,
Sana-chan, we still aren't certain about that.
he would first say "there's somebody that I'd like you to meet," or something.
an8"Burutcha secret code transmission"
"V"!
Good evening.
Here, here, please, have a seat.
And that's not all, ma'am.
...he turns his desk upside-down and goes wild inside the classroom!
so now, why don't I tell some stories of my own?
-- He stops in mid-sentence,  -- He stops in mid-sentence, 
Goodness, Father Hayama, you're home early...
That is why you invited Shiori-san over here today, right?
I'm so embarrassed! I'm beyond embarrassed!
Not at all.
Yes?
Remember what it was that you did!
All righty, shall we sing?
That's what you say about times like these.
I've been waiting for an answer.
he's there,
She's Here! Mother's Mother
Please only look at me ok?
Sana-chan.
Is this Manhattan?
So be careful everyone.
If a girl goes out at night alone in New York, there's definitely going to be danger.
You are Kamura Naozumi right?
Is that Manhattan? Is that the Empire State building?
Please come this way.
Kamura's manager..
What's with her attitude?
Oh maybe because we don't speak the same language.
I'm here I'm here, Kurata Sana from Japan is here.
Alright Naozumi-kun.
Sana-chan..?
Sana-chan?
I'm Brad. I've never left New York since I was born, Kurata.
If he were Hayama, "Akito do you like Sushi?", "I don't hate it" Signs: Hayama, Brad
Actually you don't have to tell us where the kitchen is.
Alright next.
Ready?
Goodnight then.
Let's just go rest.
Goodnight, Naozumi-kun.
It's Ramsy.
You seem to have a very good relationship with the person in the next room.
...then comes the water...
...there goes 2 cups...
...butterfly, butterfly...fly over here...
...aha you have a tail...
Ahh! Help me!
But I originally was going to get a 20 KG one.
Sign: 10 Lbs.  4.54 KGs
Are you saying that someone added weights?
See see I knew it.
What's wrong, did something happen?
But we'll talk about it when the time comes.
Sana-chan stop!
What should we do?
You're acting like a child, Maeda-san.
Rei-kun call an ambulance!
How can this happen?!
I'm really sorry!
Mackbeagongon-san.
It's better that we don't attract attention.
Ok goodnight.
Last night's footsteps.
Start talking to others
How come in the beginning..
I don't like that person.
This well...
My manager and driver, Rei-kun. But when he was in New York he didn't like cars.
Hahaha! That's impossible!
Thanks.
I'm very sorry, Madam.
Yes!
Phew..
Well, it seems that he's currently involvedin a big project in Hollywood now...
Your first class is today.You won't have a problem, right?
So Rei-kun goes to look for Mr. Gary Hamilton in Hollywood.
That's a relief!
Oh man, Maeda-san only causes anxiety to us.
Maybe we've just looked too much into it...
Sana-chan..
Famous?
Artiste?
They're right here. Sana Kurata and Naozumi Kamura.
Eh?
Yeah...or else things wouldn't be like this right from the start...
I am Kurata Sana, 12 years old!I've lead a very colorful life since birth.In Komawari Theatre, I learned this dance step!
Waaaaaaaaaahhhhh!
Dance, dance, dance, dance!
...plus 2 earlobes...
Oh, man...
Ah! You're the guy with no manners fromyesterday!
but also to see the audience enjoy watching it ...
Actually he's not such a bad guy...
There wasn't a need anyway since the injury wasn't so serious.
I guess so...
Naozumi... so handsome...
Thanks.

That's just you.
This makes it pretty clear, Sana-chan.
Who would do such an 'angry but can't express myself' feeling-causing thing? Do you know, Shimura-san?
Please get another room ready immediately.
I think you forgot to turn off the shower.
It feels like..
Meaning...
Even if we start with just a tiny clue...
Hiding and doing sneaky things, you should be ashamed of yourself!
Michelle!
But it can't be helped, ma'am.
All kinds of odd things have been happening since we've been here.
Not Sona!
The person who trashed your rooms wasn't me.
How could I do such a thing to important guests?
But, but, SOMEONE must have done it, that's a fact.
Uh, thank you.
I've only been able to see pictures of you, I'm so glad to finally meet you.
Eh?
Sicil, you too.
Don't you know?
Didn't I say that before formally introducing you that you mustn't meet?
But Mama, you keep saying that but you were never going to let me meet him.
What's going on? What do you mean?
That's not it, Sicil. It's all for your own good.
I don't understand, Mama.
Pleased to meet everyone. I am the current stage manager, Scott.
The title of this production is 'Endless Summer', and is a musical comedy inspired by Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'.
Yeah!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Too Exhausting!
Aaah! Kurata Sana!
A lot of things will happen here.
You're right.
Okay.
One pile, one pile, there's one pile oh...
Wahahaha! To be continued! Note: each verse begins with words that rhyme with onetwothree; e.g. three rhymes with 'Sri' from 'Sri Lanka'
Fly!
I've met him! Gary Hamilton. The big movie producer!
I'm really really moved! Great!
But with no sunglasses - that's just my trademark.
We can't figure out what is going on, or who is doing all this...
We want the production to be a success, Michelle-san.
Wait a minute, let me talk!
My brave-hearted but gentle ally in our New York adventures, Naozumi-kun.
But who would go that far to chase us away from New York?
You're worried about what that strange man said, but we still don't know what's going on.
Alright, I'll do it.
Does this mean that there's someone else other than me who doesn't like Naozumi being here?
What are you saying, Mama? Why would I do such a thing?
Yes, that's it.
When people...
Yes.
So that's how it is. I wanted to tell you everything I know anyway. Listen, you are....
I thought this was an important message!
"They don't need to see us."
"Let's help them with our powers!"
The "Soaring magic of love" dance.
Hmmm?
A cheap apartment has its drawbacks as well...
Sicil disappeared? Gone to his place maybe?!
Five!
One, two, one, two, three
Hiccups, hiccups they won't stop.
Hiccups, already six, it doesn't stop.
But if Sicil's here that means...
I made it all by myself! It's great, isn't it?
Why? What is strange?
Why would Mama be sad? Why?
I hate you! I hate you so much! I hate you just the same as my mother! I hate you!
Their manager was a disaster looking for an apartment today.
Just what kind of attitude shift is this?
Gary!
So I'm the only target, just as you said before.
And you're...
Yes.
Yes. Please excuse my rudeness, but you are...?
Naozumi, Sana, I'm sorry, but could you return home before us?
We'll talk about the details later.
You're the ones who know the best the reason why. You're the ones who are embarrassed, aren't you?
That's why I was pushing them out in your place.
Don't get close to these two kids anymore,
I don't know...
It's not 'Ornaments', it's 'Attentions'.
Excuse me.
...won't we?
Naozumi...
What's that?
S-stop it! Release me!
Since I'm doing this job, I should be used to the smell of make-up.
Rei-kun, Rei-kun, Rei-kun! We've arrived!
He's a half like me!
Eh... you're not a father with his children? Then...
Sign: During the Explanations It's a strange story.
It's perfect!
What are we going to eat for dinner?
Yes, what shall we do?
If you're talking about preparing the dinner, I've already done it.
Brad...
We tried really hard to find it!
Sicil-chan's laughter sounds like an angel...
I'm stupid, don't you think? I didn't think about Naozumi-kun's feelings.
Something... happened...?
Oh, I have to go to the shop.
Sana-chan...? Come in.
What's happened, Sana-chan?
It's nothing!
Eh? You're going to skip the lesson?
I don't need a mother.
But this 'Naozumi' is your real kid isn't he?
Is there something you'd like to eat, Naozumi?
My brave-hearted but gentle ally in the New York adventures, Naozumi-kun.
Bernadette. Call me Bernie. I am making some delicious turkey, so hang on a little.
What's up?
No! I'm not going home! I want to be with Naozumi!
Because she is your mother who gave birth to you.
Michelle. Sicil is staying here. We know the location.
Yes....Whaaaat?!!
No it's not!
Naozumi-kun! What are you looking at?
Now it's your turn!
Yaaa!
Like this, anytime you want to play.
I'm sorry, something got into me.
I'm alright. Please don't worry about me.
Damn...
One, Two,
Whee, Naozumi praised me! I'm so happy!
Stop! She got tired after being so enthusiastic, and fell asleep. Please be quiet.
How long do you plan on staying out here?
Really! Anyone would do that for a loved one. I'll do the cooking and wait for him to come home! Great, isn't it?
Do you love him that much?
Thank you for waiting, Sicil.
Give Sicil back and go home to Japan right now!
For fans by fans  - Oh yeah and please don't claim it as your own either...Thanks!! Translated by jokerr-13. Encoded and final editing by Sanaaki. Timed and edited by Noriko.
Her husband is king producer, Gary Hamilton.
I want to live alone by myself.
He's not here.
If anything happens to Naozumi-kun, I will tie you up and throw you into the Ganges River!
Ah! Then I'll ..
... stay and housesit.
Hi! I'm Sagami Rei, are you Naozumi-kun?
Are you Sagami Rei-san?
I'm Naozumi's mother...
Hurting other people just to protect somebody is an unforgivable thing.
Yo Sicil, Bernie! They've found Naozumi-kun, he's safe! You can come back to supper now.
Ah, you're awake ?
This person is an actress too?
We can't let you become feverish again, so you just lie here some more.
If at that time...he had stayed with me.
Sign: trick  scheme
Thank you very much for taking care of Naozumi-kun.
Naozumi-kun is so naive.
Another word for it is 'innocent'.
I'm saying you're innocent, like a little child.
Please don't tell Sagami-san and Bernie about Sicil.
About the lessons...
So that's settled.
Welcome home.
Welcome home.
Because he's always trying to avoid me.
That time I fell from the stage, my leg tendon snapped.
Are you going to be like a maggot, indecisive forever?
It'll be ok.
Michelle Hamilton's child isn't allowed to not be able to dance.
Neither of us ever thought of ourselves as children whom no one wanted.
All the things you've done were wrong!
Hi, Brad.
Wh-what's that?
I don't want any. I don't want your pity.
I don't pity you in the least.
No matter how it tastes, it's all mother's cooking.
Naozumi's mother who appeared out of nowhere, Mizukuchi Yuko.
Naozumi Kamura is currently at her house.
She went out just now to buy something.
Ah, I'll make some red tea.
I thought of everyone at the "Kamura School" as my family...
Ed. note: Kamura School was Nao's orphanage
Out.
Shut up.
I admire your talents.
Look, Look, me and Naozumi.
Music!
Some pretty good dancing there....
Long time no see, Gary.
Ever since you scratched me off at the "Pretty Lady" screening until now.
Donuts, Donuts, let's eat them together, Naozumi-kun!
Right? Why? Why? Why? AHH....
Mister!
I have the skills to make the audience cheer for me like crazy.
So what will it be?
You want Naozumi to be in your musical, right?
I want to stand on a theatre stage. I want to receive the applause and cheers from the audience.
Okay.
I did it, I finally did it!
It's not the time to hear it reversed. Note: Babbit used Sana's toy to hear everything Gary said backwards
No way, how can it be?
Because the audience requested it again. Sign: Babbit's number song
...a serious scene is the most troublesome scene.
...a place where red tea is popular.
Mister, who are you really?
...but there seems to be something wrong between those two...
You don't have to make a gesture when you say your name.
Don't drive a car in the park!
That's what I think, anyway.
Pizza pie, pizza pie, pie....
I've always thought you would be a successful person.
A woman with no talent like her.
If it still doesn't work out, he'll still have us, right?
I don't think anyone will believe that.
Out! Everybody get out!...
Thank you for ordering!
I support mother.
Hi! What will happen on next week's Kodocha?
Ahh... Michelle wears a swimsuit!
I have something to discuss with Naozumi-kun's mother...
...the important things between women.
It's disgusting.
You want to get close to Naozumi-kun so that you can use him.
...that's part of your plan to win the lead female part.
Isn't it a mother's right to do whatever she wants with her son?
Because you didn't go to dance practice at the theater...
That's what you discussed?
Sicil!
The stuff we just said...
Leaning against your shoulder...
Please keep lying to me until I die.
We're here! Thank you!
Hey!
You're jogging at this late hour?
Isn't Sicil with you?
Naozumi-kun, she's gone! Sicil's gone!
She still hasn't returned.
Yes.
I see.
I'm going to go look for her.
What's the matter?!
Six. Six. Can't stop.
Where?
Don't give up! You have to keep on living!
I still have hope.
It's not Sicil.
Wrong person.
Come on. Come on.
At Giants Stadium, the girl who came in contact with the soccer player has fallen.
It's there!
I'll stab myself in the gut in atonement.
I'm sorry, but I didn't have anywhere else to go.
Everyone lies to me.
Sicil, look closely at your Papa and your Mama's appearance.
I've been searching for a long time.
Thank God. Thank God.
I said before I dislike disobedient children.
I'll use anything.
Let's go home. Let's go home.
Today and tomorrow we have free time.kyou mo ashita mo himakkusu
I am ultra relaxed!watashi wa urutora rirakkusu
It feels funny.
...don't let go...
Hmm?
And this time...
Yeah...since I'll have to see them sooner or later...
Who are you?
Sicil, I should have told you about this.
It's okay.
I was thinking that Naozumi would be welcome to live together with us.
Hey old man, are you really seriously considering that?
Naozumi will be able to dance, but I won't be able to.
Then we don't have much time, do we?
Go home, go home, go home, go home
When you came, I knew you would have to leave someday.
I...that is...
Naozumi.
I'm so happy...
I'll definitely get in touch with him.
"Seven", "seven", that's how you say "shichi" in English
In Japanese, you can also say "nana"
Well, since we're going back to Japan, I was wondering if you could pass on the news.
To tell the truth, it's Makubagyapan-san.
Sicil?
Take care, Bernie.
I'll be fine.
The male star didn't come to New York.
Broadway.
He's called the Master...
Who's this Master?
They had such good meals I couldn't resist!
Ah, Gary! You're busy preparing now...
This time, we're planning a big surprise for everybody!
Up till now, nobody has seen this musical.
When you see it, you'll definitely want to see it again!
Great, Gary! We're waiting to enjoy it!
But what did you think of our trip to America?
Is there an available apartment?
Makes me really worried, let's follow him.
"Kodomo no Omocha"
Right!
Mama...
To be so carefree, after tricking someone like that...
I was in 2nd grade!
I run a small inn among the Kusatsu hot springs
an8"Misako-san is busy. Do not open!!"
Dad! How can you be so carefree, like it was someone else's business!?
Please let your father have some time to relax without your mother around.
so they should be getting there right about now.
I was still immature at the time.
Sensei!
Y- yeah...
He is a candidate to be the next head clerk at Kurata Inn.
Yahoo!
your precious 300-year history would be over in three days, Mother.
Madam Misako.
A cute Sensei?
Still, regardless of the details,
If Misako-san will not take over Kurata Inn, then who on earth will?
I've only ever seen Grandma two other times before now, you know.
so let's have a big party tonight.
I'm surprised you could get under there. I have to give you credit.
Aw, it hoits! I'm gonna die!
Me too.
My tummy is rumbling, I have a splitting headache, and my throat is sore.
What, really?
Something is about to start.
As you wish.
Not at all. I'm not bothered one bit.
Grandma...
This!
Who do you mean, "Ma'am"?
Oh, no!
That's my mother's judgment for you! She's sharp! I approve!
And if you want, why don't you go along with Sana to Kusatsu
This way, please. This way, please.
Oh, yeah.
It could work...
This week's Sana-chan.
That would be best. Want to sing, Toriyama-kun?
 It's been entertaining and funny, thanks for coming! 
Mama said it earlier!
and once he's grown up to be a good man, promote him to be your boyfriend.
To celebrate Grandma coming to see us for the first time in four years,
Mama went flying...
to take over for her at Kurata Inn. I think she is now grasping at straws.
Once that happens, it will be too late.
It does sound like it would be pretty fun, huh?
Well, a long-established hot springs inn,
Time has a way of passing you by all at once.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 30, the "Sagami, the Heartbroken Man" saga,
Sorry for disturbing you!
happily, dancing...we want to show our mambo dancing skills in New York
Who said kids aren't strong anyway?
Welcome back !
Once a decision is made, it should be done immediately.
Hey Miss, are you from Japan?
It's early.
That is .. of course ..
Firstly ..
Yeeees!
Wait a minute !
What are you gonna do Naozumi-kun?
After a while, she pursued me all the way to New York.
Well, err .. I haven't talked to Michelle about this.
That's rude Gary-san. How can you say that with such confidence ?
Crying, laughing and steaming, sticking your tongue out
I'll see you next in the Japan chapters!
Ahh .. this is terrible .. the whole Hamilton family is like America's oyakodon-baka.
Scared?
Ahh .. don't be shy, speak up. This is what the Hamilton family lacks I suppose. We'll be over there so please discuss this slowly.
Say it!
Nobody wants? Sicil?
Sicil, it could be too late to say this now, but Mama has always been blaming herself for that matter.
No, I have indeed become a child who nobody wants. Papa and Mama no longer want a child who cannot dance.
Still talking about it?Is that true?
A nostalgic Japan.
I want to jump up and dance the mambo! Mama, do come over soon. I'll be waiting. Sana.
It's coming soon isn't it? Sana's mother and others are coming to watch the musical.
But how is Naozumi feeling?
My name is Kurata Sana, first year Junior High student.
Wait a minute!! What's up with you guys?
Wait!
I'll go with you.
All the best on your stage show.
Don't catch cold.
We're as close as skin and clock now!
Stop! Stop!
Now go home and go to bed.
How can you say this type of thing to your own mother?
Ah that felt good.
Sana-chan, let's go.
Uh, ok ok.
I'll prove it to you on stage.
Naozumi-kun, are you still awake?
Yeah, she's really horrible. How can there be someone like that?
They're leaving! The audience is leaving!
That's definately not true!
Good morning, Sana-chan.
Since really, there's just the two of us here.
Mexico, Mexico.
I'm tired of this city New York that won't recognize me.
Shake hands.
What's that got to do with it?
Sign: Sensei's gone sight-seeing
Quit yakking already.
You're about to go on stage yourself, this isn't the time to be wowed.
It is your son's performance.
Mexican Taco.
You'll never have talent.
I'm her son.
Can you feel it?
Haven't we been together this entire time?
Twin angels.
It's just a giant school concert.
Didn't you tell me to shut up?
Oh oh oh.
Really?
Cheers!
Aah, how wonderful, opening night was a success.
Naozumi was more awesome.

At this time, you should throw open both arms in this kind of motion.
Yes!

This was Mama's idea.
When was the first time Naozumi was part of something Gary produced?
Brad!
Hurry up and drive!
Sicil.
If I'm not by her side, Sicil...
Why is she suddenly...
See, I made a bridge.
You...
I'm really angry.
But, I can't go through the rest of my life with this kind of expression on my face.
I thought that it would be great if we were always together.
Naozumi.
I hope that you won't let me down, Naozumi.
The world will be mine!
Naozumi.
Ok.
Good job. That's it for today.
Good job everyone.
Tomorrow is the last day. Tomorrow is the last day.
I just know that I can't express it clearly.
Swallow the rice ball.
Sicil.
Everyone, I would like to formally reintroduce to everyone here,
You...
Well, of course.
Naozumi.
You're really returning to Japan?
It's all Papa. It's all his fault.
I feel that your family is a family that was always composed of three people,
you're still my younger sister.
Even if it hurts, you still have to bear it.
Sign: The sound of bones breaking I will never forget you either.
It's ok.
Oy, hurry up.
Thank you for your care and support, father.
Breaking the no-singing law and hiding in a dark corner singing with all her might, Sana.
When in Egypt you do like the sphinx
Bitter feelings are really strange and dizzy
With everyone together saying
Larger! Exactly!
We're starting the explanation.
He's the trumpet player, Kamura Naozumi-kun.
We saw the occurrence of Obana's arrest.
Only the people singing on that particular street will be arrested.
They're basically challenging me to a fight.
I'm going to sing!
Ok, Zenjirou-chan, Good work.
Welcome to Sana's club.
Such a weird law.
What... is it the cops?
Oh, what a problem! What a pain!
Geez! I forgot to put on the mouthpiece.
I should find some place warn and eat something hot.
I found him at the harbor, his name's Naozumi-kun.
I heard that he can play the trumpet.
One of the performers doesn't look too good. Let Naozumi try.
You guys let down your guard, didn't you?
Just now he produced a note.
Here.
Yo, farting woman.
Anyway, hurry up and throw away the trumpet.
that girl named Mayu, why did she protect me?
That's right! My reason for being on this earth was to meet Naozumi.
Finished sweeping. The place is now very clean.
I'm in a pinch.
I'm washing my hands.
I thought that I heard singing.
Absolutely no problem! No problem!
This time we won't let you escape.
During yesterday's ambush.
That's right... by using Naozumi.
But in reality it... didn't.
At that time, Mayu-chan was protecting Naozumi-kun, her impulses were from her... heart.
We think so too.
It wasn't!
You can't play a trumpet here.
Shaking from side to side...
Love you, love you, love you love you walking the steps.
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye...
But your heart is in no mood...
Decide to lift your spirits...
Bitter feelings are really strange and dizzy
I am too
Asako, remember to brush your teeth.
Ah!!!!!
When you get back to Japan, you can talk to her as much as you want.
You were eating it with everyone else.
Because of you...
Hey Aki, listen, listen!
My name is not Buka, it's Fuka!
We got along really well with each other.
I was waiting for him to tell me that he liked me.
12 years old, we kiss for the first time.
Retireld
He... with this looks, he's not just another annoying guy.
Interesting
I have something to tell you.
Ok I got it.
Guest...
Now I'm dating Fuka.
When you make me cry,
Scary growing machine.
Because there's nothing there at... all.
That's no good, Sana.
I don't know what's going on.
The truth?
Hayama!
Whether in Japan or in New York, we fought everything together.
What's wrong, Rei-kun? Why aren't you sleeping?
What are we going to do!?
Eh? Maybe very stupid
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
No problem
You will be feeling fine
With everyone together saying
Sugita Aya-chan, my sweetheart. Ah
Don't scare us like that, Akito-kun
Shshi?
Let's all go have some sushi
...there's going to be a pop quiz today
Fitth perlod
Ok, I'll point out all the important points for this quiz
I never got a mark lower than 80 in any test
That's my first masterpiece
What am I suppose to do with you...
Let's go get something to eat
Everyone's marks weren't too bad
Please stop adding to my name
Ye... Yeah
You don't have to speak so nervously
What are you talking about?
It's not porno, it's actually a very cute conversation
Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way...
You're really slow, Tsuyoshi
What's going on? You have a refreshing attitude recently, Akito
Akito-kun's face is always like this
Akito, things are getting more serious
Yeah. Look, that's him, he was on Teen Net
It's like this... I'm here to talk about Fuka's boyfriend Hayama Akito-kun
Huh... it doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Larger! Exactly!
everyone believed the media and Ishida-kun
She totally denied it last time
You mean Hayama-kun?
Its been rescheduled to next week
Later
Eh? Papa, you're back early today
Sengoku-sensei is worried about you too
That's not true, Sengoku-sensei is not worried about me at all
Fuka, Papa and Mama didn't say you can't be with him,
She sounds strange
No matter what happened,
What happened?
I had a fight with my parents...
he should just tell us straight to our faces
I know a day like this will come.
I understand, and goodbye
They are really doing it
I'm sorry, everyone...
After Sana came back to Japan,
That's great, Sana-chan wants to see all her friends too
How's Sunday afternoon?
It's Sunday
Can I tell them that the couple in the magazine is here?
This is your first time here?
Why are we standing here for, let's get inside
Everyone, welcome
Welcome, my working partner
I want to join you too
Yes, thank you for taking care of Sana
That's what I'm suppose to say
You should consider her appearance normal
What's this?
I'm a very good person
Then, Tsuyoshi-kun and I,
Fuka-chan and Hayama-kun
Oh right, I have something here
Stop it, what's so great about it?
Watch all this too...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
It's alright! It's alright!
At this rate, you'll be first!
Decide to lift your spirits...
One step different from being relaxed
Like studying, or sports
Fuka!
What will you say when you see that picture?
Episode 84: The Manager Danger
It's good how things turned out
Right?
What? Everybody thinks you two look great together
Wait for me
That's great...
Announcement!
This is the first time for them on a date on their own
Oh, Naozumi-kun!
Really? Then lets go and eat
But Naozumi-kun seems to be a little stiff
I will do anything! I will try my best!
Are you free for a minute?
It seems like you have gained more weight, It's really hot like this
How can it be so sudden?
Mao-rin! I'm coming
This is...
Okay
See you later!
Um... I want to ask...
I'm so happy I'm going to dance
Why are you being all subjective?
And break the tiles to pieces
Let me take that down...
So I bought Oolong Tea
Don't you feel embarrassed about it?
Sign: Don't use violence! Tsuyoshi-kun's face is now swollen
It was really long time ago now
Hayama! It's finally going to be the black belt right?
So, don't worry okay?
I'm done eating
Why does it turn out like this?
Hello?
Fuka?
Relaxing is very important too
I will work hard on my work too
Wonderful wonderful
And she is the most important person to me
No problem
When in Egypt you do like the sphinx
It's a different now
I've just come from America and my Japanese is still quite bad.
Being able to work with Sana-chan again is an honor
I'll try my best
Sana-chan, how can you say something like that to the screenwriter?
Huh?
Now what, saying hello won't hurt you, will it?
If you don't pass the elementary exam, I'll never forgive you
I'll go ahead first
Good morning
I just told him that he should be more responsible...
What are you saying?
At least you've cheered up.
Fuka-chan, Akito-kun didn't come?
You're always the first person at the cafeteria but you weren't there today
Is it really because of the karate exam?
Um, Fuka-chan is very stressed out because of this.
How is karate practice going? Chichi father, long time no see
Is this for the white belt? For the black belt
Ah, it's Sana-chan
Chichi father
Dad, why didn't you move?
Fuka...
Akito, where are you going?
Come back and apologize to dad
One and two and one and two and One...
ei in hi ei san is...
...But even if you do that, watch out for cars...
...But even if you do that, watch out for cars...
Yolole, Yolole, Yolole-hee
We knew this day would come some day
One, and Two, and One, and Two, Eight...
They all like Child's Toy
Hi, Naozumi-kun
Sana-chan, oh no,
Sana-chan, you just received the script?
But who'd want to drink something like that?
That is... the script for scene two...
You are...
OK
Ready...
I can't say something like that
It's hard to say that line
Naozumi-kun, water
OK
Oh, no
One step different from being relaxed
Simply singing for a relax
Matsui-san's surgery is over.
and so fragile.
Come in please
The doctor says it takes ten days before the bandage can be taken off.
Sorry about that.
So quiet...
With my eyes covered I can't watch TV Programs.
But... I need to practice.
She seems to have a good time with Naozumi-kun.
The black belt.
I've mentioned Octopus head, Wordy mouth yesterday...
Or you can add... Tenshin Honey Chestnuts!
First you draw one mountain..., then comes the water... splash...
...then add two of the wooden horses stacked right on top of one another...
...plus 6 round eyes...
Wait, Sana-chan!
What? Sana-chan was forced to resign?
They look so good together, how can that be?
Don't stick your nose in.
Trouble some.
How can you take it so easily?
Why?
Though I do believe you but...
I'm home.
No, no, not at all. It's a fairly simple one.
He was called a devil by his sister and had to go through a lot of struggle.
It's me.
I always feel Relax,
...thought up this plan to program-jack other shows
and go around advertising "Child's Toy."
Isn't that funny? Huh? Isn't that funny? Right? Right? Isn't that funny? Huh?
Good morning!
Sana-chan, did you know about this?
That doesn't matter to me.
I- it's just a rumor, so you don't have to concern yourself with it.
I'm sorry, Rei-kun!
"Pretty humiliating, Rei-kun!"
If you space off, then wham, Asako-san will be taken away from you like that!
"Child's Toy"!
You got into that accident because your attention wandered!
Oh, and I buried a landmine over there.
Oh, there's a landmine right there, too.
She hung up on you pretty abruptly, huh?
Oh, they're closing in.
Aw, shut up! I can see that just by looking at them!
Hold on, what am I saying!?
Hey, what are they talking about!?
Whoa, this is bad!
You really are good at giving reporters the slip, huh?
I've had a lot of practice.
Aah! Those two!
 Kimuchi is intruding, lu-lu-lu-lu. 
Could you remain calm, even if it came to this?
The rumors about you getting married are true, then?
Hello! I'm a strange young man who dances everywhere... everywhere... everywhere...
T- that guy from before... was scary!
Okay, this is a take! Start!
No, there's only one thing that I want.
Thank goodness the car is fixed, huh? Let's go, let's go!
Kimuchi-kun is going to announce he's getting married.
Nice working with you.
My fiancee is someone famous for being the queen of quiz shows,
Once I become a full-fledged manager...
My manager and driver Rei-kun.
Sensei's intentions are in every sentence.
...and cannot be replaced.
...dishonor me!
What and what? Stop crying already.
Don't they do that every time? You should be used to it by now.
What's the use of yelling like that?!
This one, this one.
Sana-chan's acting career may be over.
I heard Hayama-kun being called a demon.
For you, for Naozumi-kun...
and for the people who work hard on the set. I've made quite a lot of problems.
So I should lift my chin up.
How can you just come into a girl's room? Idiot.
I'm okay.
What? Did you just laugh?
Will you be able to pass? Well, will you be able to pass?
White dolphin! What white dolphin?
I'm eating them.
Ah, people sent me all kinds of food. Would you like some?
So you say...
An intabyuu is an interview.
Compared to it, Japan must be boring now.
Is it easy for you to get into character?
This...
Just a little more.
So you do look down on adults?
Doesn't matter. Just write a good article.
We got our interview.
How many times do I have to say it before you believe me?
No!
I feel depressed. White dolphin!
I'll eat with you.
Sana's been affected.
Didn't I say I have nothing to do with her?
I think we shouldn't see each other.
Aren't you an American girl?
What a pain for you.
Any program today?
It's not like that. Not at all like they think.
Sana-chan's not being self - centered at all.
For Sana-chan's reputation.
Then you'll pull away!
Bababababa!
She threatens Naozumi-kun to go out with her.
Before playing? I wonder what it is.
Harmonica, Ocarina? Or is it Ukulele?!?
This is what makes me a pretty junior high school student.
Ah this feels good.
I'm fine, I'm fine! Bye, Rei-kun!
Did you see today's Wideshow?
But then sometimes I feel that way too.
Ah it's ok.
These days this anime is getting to be a lie.
Then what about the thing of you threatening Naozumi-kun and now...
Excuse me for today's song!
I don't care what you do at work,
I don't have an immature personality in this school.
Yes! Leave it to me.
Ah no way, I'm taking a break.
And you didn't even write one kanji, you can't even write it well.
Matsui-san, we're ready.
We have to hurry and tell Hayama.
This is an encore...
A one a two a one two one
It spell by many characters
Say that to your father and mother
Everyone please understand this.
The reason why Fuka is like this is Hayama-kun.
Akito-kun saved Fuka-chan from a bunch of gangsters.
And he's not the type of person who would try to make people understand him...
He... Sana-chan...
He's the kind of person who would take it onto himself.
Should we walk together for a bit?
I really appreciated it.
Yeah... but I'm really glad you did.
Oh yeah, you're that kind of a person.
So, please don't be nice to me anymore.
I'm very relieved that Fuka-san is not seriously injured.
And it seemed as if everything was Hayama-kun's fault...
then this would never have happened.
But that's the only thing we can agree with.
Sensei, can you please not judge a student by personality?
it's my fault that I was turned down for my part.
That's wrong! You're wrong Naozumi-kun!
And it's more like brother and sister.
I'm never gonna say it again.
I am Ultra Relaxed!
With everyone together saying
I like you because you're that kind of a person.
That you still love Hayama-kun.
We broke up.
If it's not a 'joudan', and it's not a 'joke' then...
I'm so pissed off.
Sana-chan,
Tell me what happened between you and Naozumi-kun.
Oh? So Naozumi-kun said that he'll love you forever,
Ouch...
But, I suppose that my feelings for Naozumi-kun were love too.
Umm... Textbook... Where is it?
You guys are having a party on Christmas Eve?
I'm glad. I thought that it would be so sad to all be separated.
I don't want that to happen! I don't want to change!
wants you to play something, is that true?
I'm so happy for you! You looked so great! You looked so serious!
I'm serious about it.
I'm gonna do my best too! I'll bring out the best of your abilities.
Hayama-kun, the real reason Sana-chan wasn't in the drama,
Santa San...
Kamura Naozumi.
Who is this girl? Sana-chan is so much better.
Completely like the old Hayama-san, isn't it?
Hurata.
Yeah.
I agree!
You will be feeling fine
Even shining heads go pir pir!
why are you tumbling on the sofa?
Ran away.
It's just like sometimes when you want to eat ramen noodles, and want to add
Giant robot!
Let me see... Asatu store... I found it...
It's approaching Asatu...
The robot is destroying cars and houses.
The goldfish that know how to smile look like this
Well, that didn't work. Then let's ask Naozumi-kun to help!
Everybody lay down
To be continued?
Here, here, I turned into a carpet
But why is this happening?
Yeah, a skunk is smelly.
You stink too
Don't come over here
A pig eats tree roots
You're still worrying about lunch?
Prince?
Ah, it's here.
T-t-t-toilet seat.
You shut up, Pig.
But... there was an old lady who knew magic
I was just going to call you old lady, but the pig confused me...
You are a yellow-dog.
No.
and give a kiss that comes from the heart.
This is so simple.
Because you have moles
Just a kiss, you won't lose a piece of meat
I will lose a piece of meat
Thinking you're so cute and energetic.
I've been admiring you
who's a twelve-year-old first year junior high school student must give a kiss
That... umm...
Let us become human again!
Didn't get to eat New Year noodle.
My manager and driver, Rei-kun.
Apparently, you have to make your wish realistic
Let's take this opportunity to have a trip abroad.
Beautiful madam. Would you like a cocktail drink?
Beautiful madam...
I like the normal Mama better.
Is that so...
When I called her agency, they said she was on vacation.
Why is it Daifukumochi?
Even though I made a weird wish to the gods...
A new year... Sana getting banned by the media last year is already an old story.
Che! Didn't get it
That's true.
Being so serous in games isn't going to work.
Of course it was Hawaii!
I've been working so hard
I want to go to London and learn more about acting.
I'm sorry.
Hayama! What's up?
Is that so?
Shimura-san?
Everything would be a mess
This is direct mail for bargain sales.
I haven't been totally forgotten yet
If it is, it's almost right.
F.C. 's banner. It has to be here.
It's clearly here.
Anyone home?!!
Excuse me, Anyone home?
Are you really embarrassed?
Did you send this record mail?
Fan Club? Mine?
Please come in.
It's been a while since there were so many flashes
Our fan club members
recorded every show that has Sana-chan in it
But now you lost because of all these adults...
Sana-chan... Sana-chan...
Excuse me!
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't write the script for the last scene.
I wanted to hear your thoughts once more
...I learned the truth
The main point is, you remembered me
In other words, they're educational videos.
It's... math?
Excuse me, these are the Daifuku mochi our guest brought.
Thank you so much for helping me
A little more acceleration at night
One step different from being relaxed
Bababababa!
Alright I'll do my best for the 3rd semester.
I want to make achievements.
See you tomorrow!
Nice to meet you.
Kurata Sana here, nice to meet you.
This is the Cameraman and the A.D.
This image is pretty lousy.
I wonder what 22 is.
From problem 5.
It's ok
This is bad! It's trapezoid and parallelogram.
Trapezoid and Parallelogram. She read that as that,
Wow an adlib joke, now that's cool.
Let's go.
My new job started! If you would like you can come and see it!
Sana-chan!
I wonder if that's true.
The run is going down soon.
Ok Sana-chan let's do the easiest problem, Q:1
I'll do my best with all my strength.
Nanda-chan, let's try to solve this problem.
If you do up to that end you're going to go out of the set.
Director! Today, let's stop the multiplication now.
This is acting,
I heard the circumstances,
He didn't change.
Oh well, oh well.
Ah where is Chitose-kun?
you don't know that even the elementary scholars could solve.
Ah! You mean the one in France?
Eh! I could do that?
London huh...
and nothing was solved.
Sana.
When god isn't here, then you beg to the man.
I'm gonna say this in advance, but I'm a strict teacher.
You can catch up to everyone.
is why we have to study math.
Life is math. It's predestinate.
We'll have splendid life.
Ah this is so peaceful.
The same,28!
OH! I see! Easy easy!
why we have to learn this kind of lousy thing.
and all we have to do is to film it all the way.
The filming went along smoothly.
And Sana-chan got infected too.
Ok.
Oh yeah a letter came for you.
Eh really?
What? From Kurata Sana?
What the hell?
You will be feeling fine
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
Bababababa!
Simply singing for a relax
Ah! What is saying?
The real Sana is right here.
Sana-chan, what are you saying?
Whoa! What's going on here?
Actually, I really like you a... lot.
Who is it?
What bouquet?
Um... okay.
I heard you're going to have your own photo book too?
Everyone? Who is it? What are their names?
You're saying I have a twin?
You're the real Sana, right?
If you're the real Sana then get a grip.
Whoa, I shouldn't say such serious things.
But Sana-chan's efforts have paid off.
All right, let's start shooting Vol.3 today.
Don't say it like that.
so famous Sana-chan.
But instead you didn't complain.
I don't deserve all of your compliments.
Thanks, Rei-kun.
Hey, Hayama-chan.
Traning, huh? You're sweating.
I'm talking about the outfit for that concert.
The fake.
Sensei, please hurry.
Younge brother?
Everyone's inside. We should go too.
Wait a second.
You're an imposter.
Wait a second.
I'm going back to reason with that girl.
Even though I don't want to, I'm turning 13 soon.
Impossible. I'm the real one.
Me... I was hired by someone.
We asked him to come.
But why?
We spread rumors and other things.
Why?
I'm leaving now.
Good luck. Bye.
Rei-kun, let's go home.
But lastly, I want to say something.
The real Sana-chan is very good.
Sana-chan, the video series is getting rave reviews.
I heard that the videos were really good.
Ah! It's Kurata Sana again.
it's from a little girl with the same first and last name.
This way, kids who can't go to school can
So that's why.
Yeah, supporting each other is the best way to help your fans.
Isn't that Zenjirou-san's voive?
When in Egypt you do like the sphinx
It's a different now
Hisae-chan, morning. Morning!
Sana is really talented.
That's true.
I already decided not to be absent. Is it because...
Please look at this!
Kurata Sana has been reincarnated, please give her a chance.
...this is the true way a middle school student's life should be.
I finished all the things I need to do, even the air smells very fresh.
Sana... Hana... who cares what na...
Old ladies who often become the topic are really scary.
So, let's start our lesson.
Everyone, long time no see.
I didn't know it was this sad
What are you talking about, Xenjirou-chan?
Next.
Yes, coach.
What? Old ladies 'Toy has been cancelled? '
So they want to fined that big martial arts star, Dai Gu Shan...
...to play the sho3w Old Ladies Baby together.
You are as funny as before.
If Tsu-san will help us?
You wrote the first tow words incorrectly.
She doesn't have time to answer the phone.
Is this Akito? It's me.
Because I told everyone to come.
I am so glad that I could be with Tsuyoshi-kun in the morning.
I should say thanks to you
Isn't proposal spelled incorrectly?
I finishe
This is not the time to sleep.
Quick, eh?
I am the chief. '
Ouch.
Got it.
Yeah, she's the little girl in the ideo.
I missed this set.
In America it feels like Texas
Then you'll pull away!
Bababababa!
I'm always relaxed
Hope there's good news.
Yes! I finally had the courage to call him!
Ah, that girl who's sitting by the window and gazing out at the streets.
Teen Net's Valentine Event.
Oh that? Don't worry,
Great! How many postcards did you sent in?
Tsuyoshi...
The Valentine Event would be an excellent chance for people haven't love.
It's too bad, I have to film that day.
I knew I wasn't supposed to, what was I thinking?
it's alright now... so I wanted to tell you.
Really?
Then I'll be able to see you at the event.
Fuka and... Hayama...
It will be the first time I've ever portrayed a heroic figure, I'll be famous!
Wh... what the heck is this?!
This our first visit here.
ln the Valentine Event Here is a sociable.
Fuka-chan!
You got it!
This is for you. There are a lot of fun games,

Ah! Sorry to give you so much trouble.
So long as you know...
Lucky!
Can't be helped, I have to go, Fuka!!! Hey, wait for me!
Sana...
It's an educational yet entertaining show.
I know, don't worry.
I'm your business manger,
I want to go see the world a bit, study, and then come back.
What's there to study?
Goodbye, Asako-chan.
Heh, looks like Rei.
Is the call phone broken? How come there are no calls?
Are you still waiting for them to call?
Yes I'm Kurata Sana's business manager, Sagami Rei, how are you?
Eh? She's going to get married? To whom?
Everyone is still wondering who's gonna take this position, we're so lucky!
Ok, so it' decided then.
Before that, telephone the director of that show.
Hey, Rei. It's Asako.
Really? Thank you you'll I know I can rely on Asako!!
...so I thought, living with Asako in London would be a good alternative.
I want to rearrange the living room for the photo shoot.
I've really heard enough about Takaishi-kun and Fuka's relationship.
Ah, I forgot about the bonsai tree.
Ah, then I have do the afro.
Sagami-san, doesn't this look better?
Today at 4:30,she should be at the airport right now.
Sorry, I need to go buy some cigarettes.
Sagami-san! Sagami-san!
He left, I have no choice now but to move everything by myself.
What am I doing?
Dammit, why is it like this?
Mama, what do you think?
You look just as strange, with your afro.
Where is Sagami-kun going to buy cigarettes?
This is the famous idol Naruru-san who has suddenly announced her engagement.
Sensei, please give us your opinions.
What the heck is Rei-kun doing?
Ah, phone is ringing, Asako-san.
Now it is you who can't wait. Don't you say that you would wait for me?
Is it really so impossible for people to wait?
What are you saying?
And you will wait for me... He's standing up!!
What if we become impatient again?
Alright.

He's like the devil!
I win!
T- these are the pictures of the teachers... m- make-- making out...?
All right...
Shut up! You called me here this early in the morning!
You don't get it, do you!?
Hmph! It serves him right!
You break your promise, and you're stripped!
Oooooh...
about how Sana-chan is doing at school, and look!
"The monkey has left, but there's a new monkey!"
You liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Now, you're going to get stripped!
Why, you...
Hayama, if you use violence, you'll be stripped! Stripped!
Only Hayama-kun is listening to what you're saying, Sana-chan.
Don't follow me. You bother me.
You should just leave that guy alone!
I'm still upset, even now, about him!
What a performer! Look, it's Sana-chan, all right!
Thanks...
And what are you doing here, anyway!?
It's like he doesn't open his heart to anyone.
Mama...
Pink, strong tea, and the reverse choke-hold.
You are someone who says out loud "give me your manuscript," when actually,
This after-dinner exercise has worked up a good sweat!
Tsuyoshi really does have a mother's complex!
Stop badmouthing my mother!!
Hurry and stop him, Hayama-kun.
H- he's settled down, right?
And, you know,
Sensei, hang in there.
I don't remember Hayama having a mother at his house.
I've been wailing for an answer.
My hear! may he settled, bu! my mind is in a...

It gets harder after this.
The masses love this kind of material.
Look at this picture of love-love.
It's okay, let them say whatever they want to.
What? Did you just say, "Heh"?
Oh, that's from that time before! Why do you have a picture of it?
She is going out with Hayama Akito, who is in this picture with her, Editor.
As you can see, they are even kissing.
--Ah! Is that... --This is the boy who took her away from home during Kurata Misako's essay scandal.
I can sort of make out the face on this Hayama boy,
Here it comes, Rei-yan!
That was pretty easy, avoiding those entertainment reporters like that.
Here's who I am. It's a pleasure.
There's a different air about him now than there was before...
The truth is, I've been a fan ever since your debut, Sana-chan.
A little precocious, like you are on TV, then.
How 'bout it, Sane-yan? Today's taping was easy, huh?
The only thing you don't have enough of...
You're kidding!
That "I am not seeing Kamura Naozumi", of course.
Hayama, are you in a bad mood about something?
Not really.
There is, isn't there? If it isn't Kamura-kun, then who? Hayama-kun?
Move it!
Nothing.
While all the rest of the world is in a tizzy over that picture of me and Naozumi-kun? I can't let my guard down!
Sana-chan is being incredibly weird.
I've been waiting for you.
Such an underhanded thing you're doing, isn't it?
Oh, excuse the late introduction. I am-
Yes, and I know that you are seeing that actress.
Get it together!
I must decline. This is my profession, after all.
Not especially. My hand was just itchy.
Which kind of stomach medicine do you take, pills or granules?
Can I have it?
What?
...have the skills to do good work, you know.
Sorry, but I've decided I'm going to be a little more thorough.
I'm nobody you need to be afraid of. I'm a magazine reporter.
It's all right.
Minamino Ward, Unatsuki Block, Henogonomu Building, Unatsuki 8005...
Are you in there, you snake!? I'm calling you out! I'm calling you out!
--Stop! --Yes?
Yes, I'm Sana!
That's okay, that's okay.
Sister, what about supper?
She died.
My, there aren't very many ingredients in here, huh?
In the meantime, I'll work on a salad.
--We have to let the eggs soak in nice and good. --Hey, Tatsuya...
What are you doing here!?
Hmph, that's the line of work I'm in.
What are you talking about?
Akito, hurry and make me a stegosaurus!
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Want some fried snake?
You never know when I'll come after you again.
And our usual classroom...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
he's there,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
We will always stand by you, Tsuyoshi-kun!
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
Who's the guy creating such a romantic atmosphere in the opening scene?
I have to go.
Who is this guy?
Sama-chan's mother, Misako's ex-husband!
Lend me some money?
Hey, Sana, you have some savings! Why don't take some out and lend it to me?
He's an example that will never improve.
Then I should go and prepare a little.
Here's a hundred thousand yen.
That ex-husband showing signs of seriousness? There must be something fishy.
Huh? What is it?
So, what exactly is happening here?
he started hanging out with bad people, and he wouldn't go home.
Maybe he's shocked because I'm suddenly going to marry.
Will we have the Stewed Meat with Potato today?
But why would she and a guy like Ryousuke-san...
Today we're seeking the person in need of help.
Let's go get their signatures! Kurata Sana...?
Shut up!!
Right, there's your mother's words, would you like to hear?
She was making your favorite meat and potato dish yesterday.
Try if you dare! Wait, mammal!
I understand.
I think I understand Ryousuke very well.
Wait a minute!
But I won't be after my marriage with Miyoko-san...
I'm not so sloppy as to not...
Uncle...
What the HELL???
That gigolo Ryousuke is this serious...
Marrying... A millionaire uncle.
Good person?!!
That's why we kept saying it was none of your business...
isn't what you're doing useless?
She wants them to like her, so does everything to complement their interests.
She is very worried!
Makoto!! Makoto...
Mom.
Really.
She was suing her own method of watching out for Mskoto-kun...
Can you stop following me around all day?
Just because he was dumped, geez.
Maybe it is karma.
Then you'll pull away!
Simply singing for a relax
Well, see you later!
It doesn't feel like a Sunday morning at all...
Ah! They're on a date!
No wonder it took away your attention.
Let's go home Time's gone when you two were staring at each other.
He'll come back for dinner, right?
then it's decided. Let's go, Akito.
What am I saying!?
In Sasna-chan's eyes, she gives out chocolates to the fans on Valentine's Day.
Absolutely not romantic.
I understand. Dad's office.
Wait! You happy little thing!
This is...
He dated her last time, is he dating someone else this time?
Sana. Ah! Fuka!
To tell you the truth, I think I saw something that I wasn't supposed to.
And now I don't know what to do.
Should I tell? Or should I not? It's giving me a hard time.
Does Akito know about this?
Yes, are you done with your business?
I'm home.
What's wrong? Hayama?
That Nishiawa.
I've been suspended before!
That took a long time, but I still decided to buy the socks.
There's an indecisive somebody over there!
Make the business black and white!
Make the business black and white You'll feel worse, even more uncertain!
That's that. Fuka, what should we do first?
What are we going to do next?
Ah, wait. Don't move.
Thank you. Actually, there was nothing.
What is up with this, Nishikawa-kun?
What are you talking about? I'm his girlfriend!
Today, Sana and Fuka volunteered to make dinner.
Your lunch is right here!
One step different from being relaxed
The weird white bat, Babbit. My pose hasn't prepared.
we will determine
the different boiling points... of the substances.
Hayama left the classroom AGAIN...
Really, it's the kind of thing that you would think about, Hayama.
K... Kurata?
In the past, you would has changed your face at once.
...but get pissed off when they see Kurata Sana.
Sengoku-sensei, he's aiming for your karate.
If you find 5or more people who want to join in
Onda, Ink! Yes, sensei!
Sugita, I don't care if it's you...
Sorry, Akito-kun, if that's God's will, I'll certainly do Aya-chan's part.
He must be thinking. It's not like I'll eat you.
We're looking for Karate club members...
They choose their perfect skirts.
but their pants are inside out.
That's nice, that's nice, isn't that life's Ukulete.
Ishida-kun, you'll actually join the Karate club for us?
What you moron?
Yeah because I got this.
Yeah in the hallway in front of the bulletin board.
Wow he's such a dull child.
Nobody uses it so I thought this would be good.
Isn't there any place bigger than this?
I won't say something
just stand it before we have our league's formal classroom
First we'll, lightly do 30 laps.
Well... excuse us a minute, Sana.
What's wrong, Fuka?
Suzuki-sensei if you're being so lenient like that, you'll regret later.
Thos people, if we put on a sweet face they will run wild.
If don't be careful and make little wrong now,
Akito will really get it.
Finished...
Hey wait, can we have a toast to raise the mood?
The day when Mama found me.
March 7, March 7.
A lovely baby!
For the bright future of Jinbou Junior High School's Karate Club!
I'm Kurata Sana, first year of junior high school student
So I'm gonna him rest at home.
Your record is broken now.
I have to take back today's part. The karate club is so hard-working,
Brother dinner, what's today's dinner?
You are sleeping?
It's not Yamano Anata!
It's 2 more people. Isn't it 1 more person?
Don't look at Sana-chan so lowly like that. She can do math!
It's not me!
Hey nosebleed did you see the notebook?
Oh it's Nakao-kun. Oh yeah.
Let's think about the campaign more seriously.
Wait it's burnt...
He's not there. He's already went to school.
Wait a minute please.
Karate Club is a good place to come for a bit!
Smiling is good, do karate to do this!
Damnit is this good enough.
On earth there are 32 billion people,
Why are you working so hard? Because isn't fun! Yes, yes.
Most of it is stuff that won't do us any good. That's not true.
So that means he was missed from yesterday morning.
You probably don't even know who Nakao-kun is!
Hayama-kun can I have a minute? Sengoku sensei,
A person who rots once will never get back to normal again.
But I never knew that the training would be so hard. Even I tried my best,
but Hayama said that I can't do Karate anymore so
and were you on friendly terms with him before that?
No, just common friends.
Hey you're not following here.
Not what type he is,
but how he was acting.
They were not torturous. Answer for yourself Hayama.
Head teacher, please go with her to find Nakao.
But I never thought that training would be so hard. I have tried my best.
and I was so sad. My precious no absence record has been destroyed
He...
Oh you're here.
Let's see it!
don't knew Nakao-kun.
Ahh he's a real idiot, isn't he.
I... this is what I am.
Before this happened. I wanted to expel you though.
In balcony of the north old school building, there's a room,
My neck doesn't move.
She was with Akito
Yeah me too...
So Nakao-kun, it's all this fault.
Even if I go out, there's nothing for me out there.
He's the king of uncoolness, really he is stupid.
I'm not crying idiot!
When something little happens, then I run away quickly.
When I don't know how to do, my friends leave me.
In other word, we have little chance to change in our life.
I won't say that again! Brother!
and he was with Kurata.
Nakao-kun is in the building! What?
A little more acceleration at night
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
was I think Nakao!
Nakao! Akito!
Suzuki sensei and Sengoku sensei please go with them.
What are you doing here? Sorry.
Mama.
That's fine
I see
I'm sick of life, everything is so annoying.
Hayama, I'm be side you.
I was thinking those kind of boring things while I was walking
Alright, let's do that
Um...
I didn't do anything, I became reluctant, I was mad about my death
Thank you. I can do it right?
In the conference room, the teachers are talking about Nakao-kun right now
You guys! Wait for me until I come back!
Got it!? You guys wait!
Fuuka-chan!
I wonder what's gonna happen next.
I was thinking of the Karate Club  going to the same high school as Hayama
I have warned you all about the dangers of Hayama many times.
This time Nakao was safe so it was alright
What else do I have, Sensei?
The society that adults have just created carelessly
in our own childish ways
Sensei maybe you do not remember that there was no eraser on the chalkboard.
So you used a wet vernicle to erase so I got new brush from the storage room.
I see
The snow melted fast. Yeah
Good luck on our belt
"'Child's Toy' Live Broadcast!!"
--Why couldn't you call me earlier!? --A child who sleeps in...
...grows even more. Good morning, Sana.
I humbly accept...
Very good.
Oh, here it is, here it is.
It looks like you must have eaten something wrong again today,
What is it? What's going on here?
and tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow,
for being a nicer man than the other actors.
That dummy needs to get "ba-bing!" socked sometime! Ba-bing! Ba-bing!
I'm glad you like it.
Fantastic!
Made any "new good friends?"
our teacher's tears flood up almost to floor level!
During classtime, soccer balls fly around, rockets fly around,
and even tigers howl!
That is a zoo! And the boys are just monkeys on Monkey Mountain! Monkeys!
Every single solitary individual specific distinct separate last one of them!
Are you listening to me, Hayama!? You stupid monkey,
? When I get to school, there's Hayama the devil ?
iSch-ool!i
Good morning.
Good morning, Sensei. I've come to pick up your manuscript.
Sana-ichan...i
I-I'll c-come t-to h-help y-you r-right a-away.
I won't let myself be clobbered so easily. Nothing to worry about!
Eh? Shakey? Huh? Shakey? Shakey? Shakey!?
He didn't notice either, for some reason...
What's so wrong with being a little cute and a smart-aleck?
What she means to say is "asses that borrow the lion's skin."
the article would wrongly say!
Face pounded in!
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop that! Stop!
"Child's Toy"
Cut that out, you guys! I can't put up with any more of this! I'm about to...
You've got a lot of nerve, girls!
Don't try putting on airs! You're the ooze of 3rd Class! Ooze!
Akito-ikuni!
I didn't do anything.
At this point, we're going to have a private talk. You come with me.
Don't change the subject.
Answer me seriously!
--I see. So she won before anyone realized what was happening, --?What should I do to meat him...?
--Oh, here are my results. --?What should I do, Sri Lanka??
--and loved by everyone." --Let me see that, please.
Sana, I've got something to tell you.
? Hit him in his weak spot! Play dirty! ?
Yay!
Anatomy model!
Huh...?
That was dirty!
S- stop that, all of you...!
Eh? That's the end-of-school chime. That's bad.
I'm serious, open up! I've got a meeting for my drama today!
This reminds me of the Channel 108 Annual 2501-Round
Ah, someone's jersey bottoms.
This is too cruel...
She's still home from school over the shock she received in the pond.
Akito-ikuni!
He's cool!
Everyone is in high demand, so they're very busy. That's why we ended so soon.
I'm so sorry.
I may be tardy getting to school, but I've never been late getting to work.
He'll pay for this. He is going to pay for this. How could he do this...?
--She's going downhill, like a middle-aged man. --He's going to pay for this, he is...!
Well after all, there's nothing but really weird stuff in here.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
I'm Babbit.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
"Dad, You've Been Arrested"
Yahoo! A break! Yay! Yay!
Responding to an investigation by the Matsunami police, Suspect Oki said,
Do not forget to brush your teeth after meals.
Math, Social Studies...
What, Mom?
You can stay home... if you want.
After what your father did,
Your mother... is worried about you.
Big Brother, I'm going on ahead, okay?
and you just happened to be passing by?
Who would ever go on a date with this guy!?
Um... um... um...
R- right!
Tsuyoshi-kun, are you sure you're okay with it?
Dad actually did do a bad thing.
and so Aono is a bad girl, too.
He's wrong! That is absolutely not true.
Ah, that's great.
The lead plays it off like he's cheerful,
He wouldn't... Tsuyoshi-kun...
Don't be hasty, Tsuyoshi-kun!!
Tsuyoshi-kun!!
Tsuyoshi-kun!
Tsuyoshi-kun!
but unfortunately, he can't see anyone during the investigation.
the "Mind your own business! Who asked you to help!?" girl.
Tsuyoshi-kun, you can go over there once in a while, and before he snaps,
No, it wouldn't!
So, it was in order to help those kids?
That's why the old guy snapped like he did.
Oh, no! Not just a little glad, you can be overjoyed!
 They're also good with ice cream on top! 
Huh? You're not going?
Why not?
It's Tsuyoshi-kun!
Probably because he didn't know what to say to his dad.
Hmm...
Yes. He. Will.
Hmm...
I've been waiting for an answer.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
"Class is over..."
"'How to Console Women' by Obana Miho"
"Hayama"
Eh? His weak spot!?
"Operation Eyeball, Toothball!"
Hayama! I'm calling you out to a contest!
"Class is over..."
I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm as happy as I've ever bean!
Why are you so calm?
You wouldn't get anxious over something that wasn't there, would you?
This could be pretty fun.
Are you running away, Hayama?
Right, right.
"I've got him!"
Here I go!
Ah, damn! She's adopting a strange pose!
Sana-ichan...i
? Rain is falling, splish-splash, deep in the blues! ?
Stop!
Hold on...!
Uncle. Uncle.
Why don't you tell me everything, Sensei?
I think you will feel better once you do.
So, we often take our breaks together here in the nurse's office.
And Hayama knew about it.
Although I am starting to feel a little dizzy.
Ah, thanks.
And this is a Polaroid camera.
What was that just now?
We're doing it after all, huh?
Now, then...
"So, did Hayama forgive him?"
"That's right."
"Child's Toy"
They're pretty incredible, all right.
If you still have even one copy, I'm releasing your naked picture!
Things keep escalating like this, and your grades are going to be in danger.
Hayama! Come here a second.
you're stripped.
If you realize the extent of everything you've done,
That's right!
Now have yourself a change of heart, with a whack!
Okay, class is begin...ning...
We need to hurry and get back the parts where we're falling behind, right Sensei?
Hey.
You're no challenge at all!
Why do I have to go through something this painful!?
You've grown up just the way I idealized.
Pink, strong tea, and the reverse choke-hold.
Yes. That's what this personality assessment notebook says.
Run away!
--Okay. --You couldn't catch me in a hundred years!
How can we keep from laughing?
Has anyone ever seen his mommy?
I have! She looks funny! She has the same face as he does!
"Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you very much!"
You didn't know?
are they still piling up!?
Under the circumstances, everything up to now gets flushed down the toilet,
"Naughty Hayama, Where Are You Going?"
"6th Grade, 3rd Class"
Stop badmouthing my mother!!
iHuh?i
There- Here she is-
Ah, hey! Are you ignoring me again!?
Hey, you guys!
Let's go all-out!
Anything?
Well then, kill me-
W- w- w- why do you have to be like that!?
You think that your way of thinking is the only right way, don't you?
That's why I want to learn-- why I said I want to help-
What? What? What is this? What's the matter? What happened?
Good, it looks like you've cheered up-
All right-
then grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind,
No! Watch out!
Let's go home-
I'm preparing to take entrance exams!
Oh? Let's hea-uh awl about it then-
What did I say?
--Your sister is here, right? --H- hold on a minute---
Well, that's okay, right? Excuse me--!
Wait here! Stay back!
No I didn't-
you---
S- so that's why---?
Your mother gave all that she had to give birth to you, didn't she?
No, no, not at all-
Maybe I'm shameless, and maybe I'm a buttinski,
I know-
All right!
how come neither Hayama nor Hayama's father are around!?
Why are you running away?
? Now that I've made up my mind, I'm going down the drama path! ?
Go at it the best that you can-
Huh? Mama, you're more serious than usual-
I'm sorry I couldn't be here for the meeting-
What are you tawlking about?
--"Welcome-" It's right here in the script- --be sure to watch the broadcast!
I wonder if he went to the bathroom- He could have at least said something-
Say, what kind of drama is it?
Ah- You're the nice girl
Next week, on Friday night at 8 o'clock, please watch the drama on channel 108-
All three of you should watch it together!
If you don't, I'll come and wring your necks for salad dressing- All right? Bye!
but in reality, you're still hung up about it-"
What are you doing here?
Huh? No, he's here, but for some reason,
Kurumi-isani!
The drama's happy end will be contagious,
? Everyone will be happy, happy-py! ?
? You better not miss it! ?
Don't you like being together with them?
Watching together with the others at home?
Do you miss not having your mother around?
Sana-ichan---i
"Chicken-and-egg dum-dums"
You call others devil this, and devil that,
Mama,
Oh, I'm so tired!
C- chicken-and-egg dum-dums?
Hot! So I can't make any guarantees about the flavor- Hot! Hot!
What do you mean by that!?
One other thing, Akito--- Dad's going to come home as early as possible-
By the way, I hear tonight, we're having chicken-and-egg over rice-
Not particularly-
It feels like we just had quite a conversation---
That was probably--- a first---
They really are parents and their children, after all-
Mika---
Mama loves you, Mika- I've loved you since before you were born- That's why---
Even better when your whole family uses it!
For whiter teeth--
He's gone---!
I- I'll do it! By all means, let me do it!
You're going to be interviewed by Kurumi Asako!?
"Basking in the sun at noon recess!"
More or less-
---and swallow it!
Not what I meant-
Under the weight of a waterfall,
Is it this late already!?
Sensei, you're such a good person---
Her head, right?
Is that so?
Mm-hmm- He has something of a mysterious air about him,
They say he's living together with his girlfriend-
The fact is, you see, I found him and picked him up in Shinjuku-
---I guess you'd call it-
Not a chance!
Huh?
This is no time for that!
No answer, huh?
Now that I think about it, that is a little weird, maybe---
? Emergencies come unexpectedly! ?
---my boyfriend!
I didn't dump you!
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
I always feel Relax,
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
and stick all over each other, even in front of the students."
and it's the very picture of friendship and peace.
Sana-chan... Sana-chan...
Tsuyoshi, what do you think you're doing, taking the girls' side!?
Even when you do it right, you get snapped at.
What do you mean by that?
...is my heart and soul!
--Your way of thinking is outdated! Right? --Old-fashioned! Low-grade!
Hardhead! Anyhow, the girls are not cleaning!
I dare you to say it again!
Hayama! Is that what you mean!?
It doesn't matter either way, does it?
Will the gentleman who is hardheaded about me
I will teach the guys!
Be my guest!
--...class is starting! --...class is starting!
 Build a great nation, Kamakura Shogunate! 
--Let the boys do it!
Limbo!
Principal!!
Don't run in the hall!
After you get married, you'll be the one left crying, Mitsuya-sensei.
In other words, fighting to the very end. You see? Okay.
Nothing beats rice for us Japanese boys, right?
--Yummy!
Is this what it's going to be like every day?
I like rice, after all.
That's the dream of any girl.
A class on learning the spirit of Japan?
Kurata is starting up!
that's what we cannot give up.
That's not it, I tell you. What do you think I should do?
Spaghetti sure is salty with just the meat sauce, huh?
How long is this going to go on?
After all, I liked cleaning and doing laundry from the start...
--Yeah! Yeah!
The "Child's Toy" ambush reportuh team is here!
I hate losing.
Okay then, Burutcha!
Oh, it's Tsuyoshi-kun, who sent us the postcard,
Wow... they showed us some great drama, huh?
but what about the contest?
Boys, getting along is the most important thing!
--Enough of this, you guys! This won't make for a good show! --Zenjiro-chan!
Our apologies to all his fans.
To deepen our love.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
...up to now, just for today,
What's going on!? Take off those sunglasses!
Show me your face!
Glasses with eyes in them!
Rei! Call me!
Now then---
I'm scattering flowers about!
Pfft---
I'm home-
I ducked him and came home myself-
Do you mean that seriously?
If so, I can't see you as being anything
Mama, we're home! I brought one of those homeless guys
--when she thinks as much of me as she does, --to give you your allowance-
Huh? You're kidding- I don't get it-
Er, no, that's not true!
"Mayfly-y"
And what kind of train has tires, you dummy!?
You aren't by any chance having a fight, are you?
I wonder if we don't need to spend a little time apart
Come on, come on, you guys, you're laughing too hard-
You can't cawl yourselves very good perform-uhs
if you laugh at someone's teeth!
Sorry-
But---
I don't know where to reach you-
At times like this, I should sing and blow them all out!
? "Back against the wall-" That's what you say about times like these- ?
? Put them together and you get 15 pains- ?
? Pain and sadness, I welcome you! ?
No, no, no, no! How did my song end up like that!?
? Smiles are the earth's treasures- ?
What's worse, they must not think much of us to make us go on foot-
Like this-- mmmwha!
Welcome to the observation lounge-
so please make some serious observations, okay?
I mean, look! People are small to begin with,
Let me join in, too-
Hayama!
Mama, I might not be able to go to school anymore!
I'm sorry- I didn't mean for this to happen-
"Pinch, Pinch, Sana's Love"
It's your own fault for getting your face so close-
What's with you? Don't get all worked up over something like this-
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you-
and it was like she called out to me-
--Wha-- wha-- --That figures-
--What do you mean by that!? --Ah, it's no use!
Let's straighten this up and get out of here, quick-
---here?
If your manuscript is late this time, I'll have to face the editor--!
Why won't the sensei give me her manuscripts on time? Is it me--?
? Who does get it? I don't know! ?
It's just---
I don't get it any of it!
"6 commercials!?"
"And so, having said that---"
"Thank goodness---"
i...panic!!i
I'm so--- terribly embarrassed!
She's not listening-
has booked an inexhaustible supply of work for me to do-
Zenjiro has reached his limit!
At this point, I'm bursting with energy!
No!!
Wash! Wash! One, two, four!
One more time, okay?
He licked up so many of them while we were shooting---
Ah! All done! All done!
I thought that we could keep going,
Never mind, just drive where I tell you- Now---
I'm not so flavorless a girl as to treat men that I've broken up with
Flavorless? Oh, you mean distasteful-
Yeah, me too-
Fine with me! I'm going to find me an even better pimp--
Wow, a package of sushi! Is that a present?
--If he had a crush on me, --It looks like she really is distraught-
"Hayama"
The sushi from this place is exceptionally delicious, huh?
What does he want!?
Don't ask me-
Be quiet! What about you!? How can you be so unconcerned!?
How should I know?
Mm-hmm, it's something that does happen- He's developed a stomach ulcer-
So, I want to keep him in the hospital for 15 days or so
Um, is there another adult?
Akito, I'm sorry about this- Did I startle you?
So was I-
Yeah, Pop-
by making this Burutcha vibrate, I'll be able to know, whatever it is-
"Farewell, My Pimp" I don't need to just yet, huh?
After all, you've already kissed- Right, Shimura?
It's not like that! He did all of that on his own!
"Pardon me, okay?"
"My bad"
Kurata Sana, Shinbo Elementary School, 6th Grade, 3rd Class!
Nice work, everyone-
Nicely done!
Tomorrow? Is something happening?
--Mine's coming up real soon- --What do you want for a present?
--It's close, just days away- --Good question- --I forgot about that-
It's a secret-
Now stop there! Okay, strike your pose!
Morning? Which morning? What day is it? Who am I?
Eh? If I knew, why didn't I wake her? Tch, tch, tch-
What's this, you're fighting? Have it out-
"A little while longer---"
Sagami?
Okay-
Okay, ready for take 2--- Start!
This time, we really are finished-
Let's open up to it quickly, solve it right, and finish it up-
W- what is this---?
"What happened?"
Hayama---
We're just half-grown-up kids here,
Say, which one do you think is best?
Just a little-
but she doesn't appear to be here, either-
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
"Shorokutai 'Youth-six-squad'"
--You accept it? --have you already accepted it?
Shh! Not so loud! We're having a little trouble, you see...
Let me just say, we're only talking about within the anime!
Shorokutai, huh? Hmm...
Sorry I'm so terribly late!
Yes, let's. Mayu has other things scheduled after this.
--In that case, I would like Kamura Naozumi-san to be my co-star. --I told you that before, didn't I?
How about if we all make handmade presents?
at something girly like that. Oh well.
My word, to think that my Mayu-chan would receive this treatment!
Oh, yeah! They decided on Kamura Naozumi-kun
U- um...
Sorry.
--That's just like you, Sana-chan. --Those are what we call
Sana-san, any party thrown by you sounds like fun.
Okay, Notsu-san, let's whiz through this and finish it up quick!
We have another engagement, so if you'll excuse us...
One-two, one-two, lightly, lightly now...
Is that Zenjiro-san?
Zing!
Hey, good morning.
Um, I'm hoping we do well together on today's drama rehearsal-
This is a love-love comedy, with Mayu-chan and Naozumi-kun.
He is always sitting there on that bench,
Um, if it's okay with you...
I...
Flower blossom doggie! Flower blossom dog-
I've absolutely had it with this! I hate the drama, the song, and everything!
the whole time, I've been feverishly continuing my lessons.
It's poses like that one that I find most irritating.
--This is so embarrassing! --Over-the-hill cue ball!
S- sorry! Sorry.
That's what I was thinking when I came here to wait for you, Mayu-san.
But you do, right?
-- You're the only middle-aged one here! 
What kind of performance is that? You're not out out to be pros.
Kurata-san, let's show them how pros work.
--Put this on. --Sushi...
-- that just means your alive. 
-- If you don't 
Kurata-san...
I- is that?
Yes, I was.
Ooh... aah...
The Confrontation Between Presents and Aya-chan's Love,
It's starting to get chillier. Please take care not to catch cold.
"Keep hanging in there- Aya"
Sensei, have you heard any word from Tsuyoshi?
What is it? What is it?
Which is why I thought we should go over to Tsuyoshi's house and see, right away-
The legal formalities are all completed, so they're no longer family-
After that, I don't care-
but as we were leaving his house earlier,
No-
"Bottom of shoe" What do you think you're doing!?
Now I'll never find a husband, for sure!
No, he didn't squeeze anything, so I'm still safe!
Tsuyoshi could have gotten hurt, too-
Hey!
we should have a grown man there, too-
Slimy dads, full-bodied dads---
Okay, everyone, please, take a short break now-
"Caution-- Cliff!"
"Fabian"
When will it be published?
? Thoroughly refreshing outdoor school! ?
but there aren't any mothers who hate their own children, are there?
You--- think so---?
Well--- I can't tell you-
It's nothing-
"If you feel like crying, come find me-"
That makes me awfully happy, Hayama-
Oh, you got away! You got away this time! Hold up!
? Won't you smile for me? One more time, one more time! ?
? How rare, how rare, seeing Hayama smile! ?
--?What fun!? --I guess I was wrong after all about her cheerfulness being an act-
All right, you!
My face is just laughing on its own-
Thanks!
Yeah, right on time-
I'm back-
We saw them! We saw them!
Oh? What is it this time?
And if he's not a girl, that means he's a boy, right?
where roses appear in the background,
I can't wait-
I'll be relying on you, Hayama!
Twirl! Twirl! Twirl!
Yeah, that we are, but we---
They said he'd be a little late-
Nice to meet you- I'm Kurata- It's a pleasure-
--Start! --and has appeared in several other things, I'm sure of it-
"Who is this Naozumi-kun?"
"Thump-thump"
i...panic!!i
It's better for both me, who absolutely adores fried shrimp,
--than for someone who likes them only so-so to, --No, that's not it---
But it wasn't my fault! I just simply---
It's not about food-
It's about you and your Mama-
But Mama has written an essay about that, and it's about to go on sale-
And what were you going to do with it? Eh?
What!?
What kind of pose is that!?
I'm definitely going to go see it-
Oh, so you do indeed like me, huh? I get it! You're one of my fans!
Just come to the point, already-
Mama, do you know something?
? That makes everything feel better! ?
I'm not allowed to reveal the content of anything until it is published!

the neighborhood association works hard to try to run the boy out-
This guy is so easy to figure out-
I said it was okay- Damn, is she even home?
This is ringing, here---
The troupe is putting on a stage production today-
What's she like? The same as she is on TV, right?
I knew it!
Kissed him!?
Oh, you mean swallowing a person! I know it, I know it!
Did you hear that? He spoke Japanese-
Then, do you know about how much she makes?
Make me!
I've gotten nervous again before going on!
? The pounding is important, the pounding of my heart- ?
Oh-
I'm getting sick of this anime!
Why don't you take up karate?
Would you like to give it a try?
i...panic!!i
If you feel like crying, come find me-
Thanks-
Oh, sorry!
This has been the white bat, Babbit-
I always feel Relax,
Yay! It's over! It's over! We can go home!
Whew, the winter is hot this year. It's got me beat.
Huh? What's this?
an8"Tsuyoshi-kun, I love you!"
N- nothing at all. I'm going to go on ahead, okay?
No, I couldn't double-dip.
After you fell in love with Kurata and Sugita
Could I see you a minute, Hayama?
...is 99.
99!?
an8"Tsuyoshi-kun, I love you"
I can't double-dip, after all.
Then you don't have to double-dip, do you?
That's dreadful.
Let's see... A space shuttle, maybe.
Hush, would you?
Okay, when in doubt, go orthodox-
It's Zenjiro-chan!
Sane-yan, I can't see in front of me! Where's the ear!?
This way! This way!
Ah, it's Zenjiro-san!
presents are like a young goil's heart.
who is deeply in love-love with Tsuyoshi-kun!?
Tsuyoshi-kun already has kind and adorable Aya-chan for a girlfriend!
But for the longest time, I've had a weakness for presents.
This week's Zenjiro-chan!
Aah! I'm so attractive, I can't stand it!
 Indifferently, Tsuyoshi-kun wobbles that way, 
Tsuyoshi-kun and Aya-chan were already in love-love, and all.
he turned his interest to Aya-chan
and thought "what's the deal with this guy?"
Big Brother, what's wrong?
It's nothing.
Aono made this in school today. It's a present for you, Big Brother.
Why are you hiding!?
--Good morning, Aya-chan.
I'll just bake you some more cookies again.
Hold on there, you. You were just thinking of something bad, weren't you?
And our usual classroom...
"Sana and Hayama's ramen"
Are you---
---even though I've already turned it on-
Unfortunately, that cannot be confirmed-
--The press was at school, too- --and her "My Trivial Secrets" corner-
Why don't you hide here for a while?
She went to the Hayama's house, all right- Having her stay there
No, that was way unnatural, Dad!
Oh, no! What do I do!?
Oh, are you still in here?
You perve!
Hayama, you really do have a mole right here, huh?
I have them, too- I was born with three huge birthmarks, all in a row-
Don't worry- That topic will never come up anywhere-
What if we disguise you?
You look more like an Arab than an Indian-
Cut that out, or I'll kick you-
Gotcha, gotcha, leave them to me-
In that case, I'm putting corn flakes in mine-
Vinegared squid-
Watermelon-
What are you doing, dressed up like that?
Done-
"Still can't sleep"
--See you- --Hayama---
What?
And even if she is, she might not read this book-
What would I do--- if she was planning to turn me over---?
Now, my dream is to take a more active role in the world,
This is where his manager stepped in to stop him,
Once in a while,
but for us to report the news
but you don't have to worry about this- He did what he did all on his own-
What's wrong?
Yes-
Yes-
You raise the child you bear-
Sensei---
My mother got herself a boyfriend, and hardly ever came home-
I was still just a child, but I truly did love him-
Cut it out!
Hey, hey, hey! "Tempura and salted fish are also wonderful!"
Really!? Thank goodness! I am Sana!
A ring worn on the left ring finger is a wedding ring-
As long as you're happy, that's great- So, how old are your children?
Huh? Well, she is, right?
I have the press after me, you see,
How completely deliberate-looking!
Undercover?
Which way, which way!?
Yes-
All right-
I thank you-
I'm home!
Oh, the press was no problem-
Welcome back-
She what!? That's outrageous! So, what happened!?
Nice work, everyone!
"Oh, Sam is very, very happy!"
Not really-
Okay!
Stop! Stop that! Stop!
Oh, you're kidding me! You know that one, Hayama?
You're kidding!
You're amazing-
"Heart of Karate and Announcement of Retirement"
...and until then, don't talk to me about work again.
I've got a one-in-two chance of winning...
Whatever, just take one! Hurry, hurry!
Y- yeah.
Inner tube! Swimsuit! Rubber raft! Skateboard! Watercolors!
And a karaoke party, swimming party, moon-viewing party!
Wipe, Hayama!
Hayama, huh?
The most important thing, to those who aspire to the martial arts--
Just a moment!
--Still, I don't think that's it. --What? What are they talking about?
--But it's surprising that Hayama would be taking anything up, huh? --No matter...
I don't need this.
Now that she has fulfilled her promise,
there's no reason to force her to continue working.
Here comes another simpleton.
If you're going to observe, then do it a little more quietly!
--S- sorry. --S- sorry. --S- sorry.
--10,000 times, I hate it! A million times, I hate it! A hundred million times, --What's wrong?
Aah! A baby!?
Heard she's gonna retire.
"Meanwhile, at the Hayama's house..."
Mm-hmm...
and live the normal life of a grade-schooler-- or rather,
I'll be in charge of her shoes...
What!? What!? What's wrong!?
We will be landing shortly at JFK New York International Airport.
Calm down! We have to finish this location shoot in New York, first.
Sorry about that.
Should we cry, too?
Huh? You guys are all here?

Excuse my long absence.
I'm sliding! I'm sliding! Gleam!
Ah! Rei-kun, Rei-kun, look, look!
The yubatake.
Now go ahead and have a bath!
Really? Still, I can't let my guard down.
Oh, Sagami-san!
You're kidding! What are you doing here?
Does that mean Hayama is here, too?
I smell conspiracy.
Skiing is fun.
Gra- Grandma is in trouble!
But Sana-chan, you have your job doing TV,

Now you're embarrassing me.
Mama!
If you sheath your swords and depart, it will be well with you.
I have to buy gifts for Hisae-chan and the others!

Huh? That reminds me, it's lighter now.

But we've met her before, huh?
"The next day, 'Child's Toy' was on location, too"
Great! That's the spirit!
Hey!
Right, I know.
Yeah...
The blouse with the stain, right? Just a moment, please.
I don't really want to see him.
Don't eat that! That's my lunch!
Don't cry! Don't cry! Big Brothuh was wrong! Eat! Eat it awl up!
Not to worry. She has to be close by. Let's just look for her.

This is an anime, so it's okay and awl,
This is why dramas are so tense!
I'm having some guys on my old route look for her.

Deciphering the code is going to be hard.
Fine, you can go home.

First comes rice!
Sour plums! Little ones!

--We were careful about that, too... --Mariko is our reason for living.
--She is an adorable little girl. Well? --just having him by my side in silence made me feel very much at peace.
he still loves us every bit.

You're going to sing?
Lights on!
You're sure being carefree is okay?
we can't have any fighting. Wait here, and let's see what happens.

Smushed that mosquito!
Why, Hayama!?
Hayama...
Look, if you do it this way, it gets picked up, see?
Come on! Tell me!
Hayama, why did you go back to being a bad person!?
I knew it...!

You're worried, which is why you're telling us this.
Anyway, I have an early start tomorrow, so bye-bye!
And you just let her go without saying anything?
Uh, what kind of work is this?
How about I put you to work at your first task here right away?
You never said anything about making her do all of this, too.

That's right when the Sensei's deadline is.
 Hayama's birthday is October 12th, 
What about your work?
Relax. It may be about a week too soon, but here's your present.
Oh, yeah.
"Director Tarantaru is this man."
I see. You've got plans, huh? That's too bad. Well, anothuh time, then.
--Hey, what work are you doing here today? --Oh, you mean you're Sane-yan's wife?
Mm-hmm.
Let me think a little while longer about whether or not I can come to your party.
--Got it? Got it? --What a drag.
Yeah.
Hey.
H- hey.
Not really.
That was something the girls told me was one-sided, on Hayama-kun's part.
...know... her secret.
Do not look down on the trumpet!
Sensei, your manuscript!
If his manager knew about it, does that mean Naozumi-kun also knew about it?
Yes, but...
No, that trick got shot down before, too! At this rate, as a manager, I'm a-
doing a kissing scene doesn't seem like anything to make such a big fuss over,
Mine might be for work, but Sana-chan said she was looking forward to it.
I hear that Kurata has a kissing scene in one of her commercials.
an8"A kiss, huh..."
Hayama-kun is losing his temper.
an8"And so, shooting day on the commercial finally arrives"
Listen up, now. Gangster Sana-chan, you come in with your henchmen in tow.
From the other direction comes Gangster Naozumi-kun, the same way.
That's it...
Here it comes...
--Sana-chan! --She got away!
Manager reject!!
It was on the cheek.
You decided it was on the lips all on your own, right?
Even though it was work, I kissed her on the cheek.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,

"So what is it you're trying to say, Father Hayama?"
"Hayama let's out a slight 'eh!'"
I go visit the cemetery on my birthday every year.
I said I'm going to visit the cemetery.
Let's see, mine is on March 7th, so...
Hey, what am I, some strange animal!? An X-File!?
I'm all excitable, and a little bit of a chatterbox, and all...
Which is it?
"Hayama says 'Eh!?'"
Huh? Eh? Hey, Father Hayama, hello...?
See?
Still, it wouldn't be surprising if there was such a woman,
Then, right now, Father Hayama really is...
Yeah, you're right. I don't think it's that, either.
Be careful.
Right!
Onda is still quite the rookie, isn't he?
Sensei, you're such a scamp.
Kusatsu is such a nice place...
I am her second-in-charge, Katagiri Sanzo.
Grandma!
Incidentally, where is Misako?
This here is Kurata Inn, folks.

Late into autumn, Mama finds herself frightened by Mama's own Mama.
Yes, hailing from Kusatsu-
In any case, I absolutely refuse to have that type of man!

Sensei!
And who are you, eh!? What kind of attitude is that to be taking toward Madam Misako!?
A cute Sensei?
--That is cute. --That's not cute.
a jumbo pirate salad, a fruit pawfait, and Milfie espresso, if you please.
Wow, that looks delicious! You piled them awl into one stack for us?
That was last week's "Child's Toy". This is this week's.
So, what seems to be the trouble?
Search me.
Huh? Soich me? You are the noise, aren't you?
Hey, now...
That was great! Right? Right? Did you see that? Did you see that, Grandma?
We have been waiting for you.
Hm? Who is that boy with the unusual aura coming off of him?
Tori?
This is so wonderful!
Yay! Lucky!
Oh, yeah.
There'll be a hundred kids!
I don't get it.
Good afternoon.
There is no guarantee that at some time,
Here, you see, I've already started to study up on being a head clerk.
Be sure to come by Kusatsu sometime!
We will see you later!
My nerves couldn't take it if she had. Father, take care of Mother for me.

Just embarrassed.
Is that how it is?
"Sea Urchin Head"
That's a fairly extreme proposal, coming from you.
The girl is style first, substance later.
I can't see very well from here. Over.
Go with him to look at something!? Where!? Where!? Where!? Where are they going!?
Don't get so agitated.
Okay, everyone, good job! Let's keep it up tomorrow, too!
Right now?
Aah! Those two!
Could you remain calm, even if it came to this?
? How boorish of you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! ?
? Everything's aboveboard here, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! ?
Okay, you reporters, that's all for tonight. See you again next week!
More reporters and such could still come barging in on you.
In any case, you should go home for the rest of the night, okay?
"And so, the day of the drama filming..." T- that guy from before... was scary!
Okay, this is a take! Start!
To see myself reflected in your eyes. That's all.
"Ah, that was scary"
"Ah, that was scary"
They're together, all right.
What a shifty fellow! Show your face!
"The Yellow Letter Co." What?
Oh, that's from that time before! Why do you have a picture of it?
As you can see, they are even kissing.
Even this?
Too bad, huh, Pops?
but I am definitely going to get my scoop, Kurata Sana.
A little precocious, like you are on TV, then.
Uh... um...
No, I couldn't...
Nothing, much.
Oh, is that right?
Who's that?
He appears to be gone now. He's not that big a snake at all, is he?
Huh? He looks just like Hayama!
You're on your way to sell some scoop photos to a picture tabloid, right?
Such an underhanded thing you're doing, isn't it?
My sensei says she would like to talk with you.
By offering that to them, I am a credit to my occupation.
Is that true, even when someone gets hurt?
Don't tell me you weren't aware of that, right?
What?
You can print as many more copies of it as you want, right?
Can I have it?
Yahoo!
How can I be a 6th grade TV personality if I'm afraid of some snake reporter!?
That's her!
According to the personality assessment notebook, he may seem like a snake,
Hayama...
Stop.
Let him do what he wants. Even if it causes a stir, it will only be for a while.
Ah! Turn off the gas! That's dangerous!
Oh, yes we do!
In the meantime, I'll work on a salad.
Let it sit for a little bit.
--Hey, can we have this? --I want it!
Pop, are you going to do this!?
Don't touch it all night long. It's not dry yet.
What are we going to do, Sensei!?
"A somewhat similar story"
Police rushed in, and the suspect who was arrested at the scene...
Responding to an investigation by the Matsunami police, Suspect Oki said...
Responding to an investigation by the Matsunami police, Suspect Oki said,
I- it's nothing.
Too many syllables.
We're leaving now.
...I was beside, standing, crying, laughing, boiling, and cooking myself!
Since way back, whenever he saw...
Even just watching TV, whenever someone like that would come on...
You dumbass! What did you do to your head!?
Aw, gee... Really, don't worry about it. That guy and I are strangers now.
Dad actually did do a bad thing.
and he becomes more and more depressed.
Yay! I came in first!
Hang on, I'm thinking right now.
You want to see him?
You're Suspect Oki Isao's son?
In any event, word is that he was hitting them for no reason.
He snapped, went berserk, and no one could stop him.
Is that a gift for him?
Oh, that is quite the bold lie.
If I were to say something here,
the "Mind your own business! Who asked you to help!?" girl.
But he doesn't have anyone anymore, so...
They said Dad wasn't hitting them for no reason, but that he had grounds to!
So, it was in order to help those kids?
Mm-hmm. Those kids were skipping cram school, and goofing around.
but knowing that he did it to help someone makes me a little glad.
Oh, no! Not just a little glad, you can be overjoyed!
Are you going tomorrow?
You can go... if you want.
Huh? Something like what?
Hmm...
There is a deep, troubling gap between the boys and girls.
Yeah, from when you two went missing.
 The next-door fence is a persimmon that often eats guests! 
I told you, it doesn't matter.
--No, not yet. --Now, see here!
H- have I guessed right, Hayama?
How long do you think Akito-kun can stand to be in this situation?
That's a relief, huh? Huh? Huh? Akito-kun?
Once she puts out her book, she'll probably become even more famous.
Never mind that, Akito-kun, about the present...
It's never happened.
I've never gotten a present before.
Here, Onda-kun!
There's going to be all you can eat, and a ton of girls are coming.
Kozue-chan? How does Christmas Eve look? Oh, no good, huh? I see...
I called every goil in the book! How could I not get a single one!?
Hello? Sumire-chan? My name is Zenjiro.
You're kidding! You're available!?
 Birthday and Christmas, happy-py-py-py. 
Mother would like to join in, but- whoa-oa-oa...
Yay! Naozumi-kun is coming, coming, coming!
Rei...
Go on, take it. Go on, go on.
Go on, tear it open!
Don't hate them.
I heard about it from Tsuyoshi-kun.
Anything would have been fine. I should have bought her something.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Merry Christmas!!
an8"Zenjiro, prisoner of love"
Hey, Sana-chan! How's the party?
I wonder if the reason why she cares about me
has nothing to do with whether or not she likes me,
Sana, there's still someone out in the yard.
Hayama...
Thanks!
All right! Sana took command of Christmas!
--Sana-chan is dense. You have to clearly tell her, or it won't get through to her. --A bedpan? A butt? A belly-button? A big salamander?
Is she your daughter!?
Was today my first kiss? My kiss?
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
to always go along with the scenario.
...panic!!
...up to now, just for today,
the saga of the verminous Maya-mom's attack on the Land of Kuraata,
"100 Haya-moths and the Scales of Fury,"
Okay!
By all means, come visit us.
Things have gone back to the way they were before.
I don't know whose fault it is.
Yeah, sure. I can understand how you don't like to clean.
It would be wrong not to do it.
Were you lying when
That five-story pagoda...
...is my heart and soul!
And I'm not doing my hair up!
Hardhead! Anyhow, the girls are not cleaning!
who treasures his heart-and-soul five-story pagoda,
What? What? What? You've got a problem with that?
--We can't beat her with words. --You guys are always making so much trouble-
Either way? It doesn't matter either way!?
Okay, Sensei, let's get class started.
The traditional hairstyle is the man's romantic ideal!
Those aren't the kind of "shoes" she means!
--to do the cleaning! --to do the cleaning! --to do the cleaning!
Ooh, listen to that!
This is an alarming situation! I'm reporting you to the principal!
Go ahead, feel free! This is the girls' fault, after all!
Don't run in the hall!
"All-out resistance" Okay, Baby's Rock!
Principal, hurry, hurry!
"Who's party is this, anyhow?"
i...panic!!i
so it's a match-up that would only happen once,
Let me just say, we're only talking about within the anime!
we'd like to get started.
And I was so excited about this, too. What a shame.
Mm-hmm! We're having it at my place! I want to do it on a large scale.
Then, you won't come?
Hmm, handmade, huh? I get the feeling I'm not too good
He said "I guess"!
You're all going to be working together, right?
Ah, mm-hmm. Right, I'll invite them!
What about the heroine role in the drama?
Um, we once appeared in the same production together.
Is that right?
Zenjiro? Who's that?
Yeah? Really? Thanks!
Yeah, that's okay! That sounds like it would be funny! I'll do it!
No! No! Stop!
Let's ease on ahead.
Nah...
Hey, good morning.
Um, I'm hoping we do well together on today's drama rehearsal-
I'm not supposed to talk, either, huh?
Please go on ahead with your love-love. Woof!
Yeah.
Is that the doll that was always exploding?
with only a moderate burst!
- her own natural self, huh?
Okay, cut! We'll use up to there.
Oh no, you really are upset at me?
If it's okay with you, please come.
Please excuse me.
She must have dropped it earlier when she fell down.
How come!?
I guess not.
Mayu-ichan...i
Hmph. Why do I have to do this?
--?let your hearts throb.? --?let your hearts throb.? --?let your hearts throb.?
Kuratai-san...i
That's a firecracker doll. W- were you surprised?
A crisis comes up for 6th Year 3rd Class' only love-love couple,
It's starting to get chillier. Please take care not to catch cold.
"Who could it be?"
Yay! It's over! It's over! We can go home!
You can't give those for homework, chief! You can't! You can't!
For one thing, Tsuyoshi only came to like Sugita
Isn't that nice, Tsuyoshi? You're popular with the girls.
Huh? I'm popular?
Big Brother, your fly is open! I can see your underpants!
Double-dipping? What's double-dipping?
After you fell in love with Kurata and Sugita
you're going to ignore this one after she gives you candy?
He seems to be avoiding me somewhat, too. What could be the matter?
when you like someone, you like them.
When we were in kindergarten, he was quite popular with girls.
"Ignore" and just as I thought he had gotten over that strange habit...
"Exactly right!"
99!?
Yeah, the two of you!
Come along, now...
Aren't you showing off a little there?
? It's terribly troubling to love-love Tsuyoshi! ?
Eh? Really? Not bad!
Gomi, Itami, and Yasuda!
You sure got Tsuyoshi good, huh?
--Go tell her "good morning"! Come on, come on, come on, come on! --I can't... I couldn't...
Yes?
and I've always thought that you're really great.
Please go out with me.
Um... I...
Which means... Tsuyoshi will never be able to escape from these cookies, huh?
"Ha"
I know it sounds trite, but she keeps badgering me, so what can I do, you know?
Allow me to explain it to you in song!
Tarantaru loves Japan's anime and kappamaki sushi rolls!
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
it's time to get out of there!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
It can be really tough being the lead character, ma'am.
What I'm saying is, let us do some stories that are a little different once in a while.
"100 Haya-moths and the Scales of Fury"
What do I do? If Tsuyoshi-kun sees me like this, I'll... I'll...
Yes, it is still there in her room.
an8"Kuraataland Palace"
I wonder if Princess Sana will laugh at it.
I'm completely protected!
Where's the protection? That's a lot different from this one, isn't it?
Even Maro-chan, the chipmunk...
I heard that Aya-chan had been afflicted, too.
Just because you defeat Haya-moth
This isn't a fairy tale, after all.
Apparently, it was around here that Mama was sprinkled with Haya-moth's scales.
And a zebra-moth...
There you are, Haya-moths!
We're getting out of here!
Grubs, are we?
You did it! Incredible! Incredible!
I just played a little prank on the god of the forest.
I became lonely,
I put a small landmine on the forest god's chair.
How about it?
I'm Tsuyo-moth.
Here is the thing about boys and girls:
As princess, you know what to do, don't you?
I really do have to put you down.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Haya-moth! You were a really nice guy!
I forgot!
Those who are put under spells by gods become immortal.
--D- does Princess Sana know about that? --Didn't you hear me when I told you to wait up!?
I'm going to put you down, no matter what!
Wait, don't end yet!

I'm not.

--We'll get the royalties! --Let's put out a book! Let's put out a book!
Call it an "essay," please!
--Doesn't matter. --I'm still not yet completely sure he's coming, though.
"A Heart-pounding Kiss at Christmas"
And what's worse, now he's coming to the party.
Welcome!
B- but still, it's just on the cheek, so it's still safe!
Huh? Oh, yeah...
As I recall, just once, your father took you someplace-
Akito...
What company do you work for, anyway?
Uh, I also have a party, with my friends.
What musical instrument would you like to hear?
Right now, you are...
Now I'll be able to take my girlfriend out and... Yahoo!!
I'm sure you did.
Sana-ichan...i
but this thing I have scheduled is-
Christmas can be tough.
If that's the case, let's drown our frustration with food!
Rei...
Go on, take it. Go on, go on.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas!!
--Oh, let's relive that day once more! Return, limbo! Again, limbo! --B- but today isn't Christmas, right? And yet why... why? I- it can't be...
Naozumii-kuni?
Ah, this is unusual! A stray dog!
Yeah.
If you love her,
Thank you for your hospitality!
S- sure...
I guess so.
"100 Haya-moths and the Scales of Fury,"
Yeah, take them, you thief!
"Haya-moth would be..."
"Hisae-moth"
"Safe!!"
Hey! What are you doing!? The show is starting-
Kurata Sana is sorry that today, once again, she is so cheerfully late for school!
Oh, that hurt, that hurt!
Good morning.
Then again, this could be...
"Hisae-moth" Hey, I don't like the way that sounds.
Well, actually... In any case, to the palace!
Hey, hold on, now! Hey!
No, I'm going! I'm wearing this to go save Mama!
This isn't a fairy tale, after all.
Oh, a giraffe-moth...
Hey...
W- we're lucky we survived, huh?
No time to sit here talking! What's that!?
What are you doing in something like this?
Okay, I'll be a good boy.
Hi there, I'm Sana-moth.
Hey, you!
Don't we give off scales?
and dancing other than limbo dancing is inexcusable!
Hey!
Come down here! I'm going to spank you until you can't scatter any more scales!
Oh, that's right.
You have a responsibility to defend its people!
Sana- Princess!
I just took a bath.

What are you doing?
Oh, my. There's red paper hanging off of everything.
Oh, dear, in here, too.

There's nothing more to it. Bankrupt means bankrupt.
? and the debt came crashing down on my shoulders. ?
Ah! Even my Nopia!
Tell me, if you were to take a lady out on a date, what course would you select?
Come on, let's get going.
We won't get anywhere if we just flap around, will we?
The media won't find you here, either.
? Having life proves that we're alive. ?
On New Year's Eve, we eat soba noodles, soba noodles!
"It was a solemn New Year's Eve."
Huh? About what? I'm doing fine!
Oh, thanks! Grateful, grateful!
Say, we should give her something too, shouldn't we?
Yes, I'm just confirming our schedule...
Yum! Yum!
Uh-uh, that's okay. I've already eaten six of them.
That's why you're so fat!
? It's time for gym, so bring out the vaulting boxes. ?
? Then we stick six beans on. ?
However, there are many other people in the world who are living
We will meet again.
There's no harm in us keeping it.
You came to see that thing?
Hello! I'm the strange young man who dances everywhere he goes.
Those of you who can spin well, come join Gekidan Komawari!
That's right.
That's right, just by being alive, I'm razoring it in! I mean, raking it in!

Good morning...
Nope.

Actually, this is who I am.

Excuse me for saying so, but it would appear that currently,
They did what!?
Ah! Well, bye now!
I'm not about to be beaten by those guys! Then again...
You're the most dismal of any of us!
Remember, about a month ago, we met, right?
"Child's Toy"? Ah, now that you mention it,
I'm home.
Hmph! If that's how you want it...
We've got lots of costumes!
I caught you!
Oh yeah? Fine. If that's how strongly you feel, I give up.
N- no, I'm not! You're mistaking me for someone else!
Or so I thought, and then I found out
You shouldn't push yourself too hard. You'll ruin your health.

Well, little by little, this one producer came forward and reconsidered.

Ah, this takes me back! This is the album from when I was in 2nd grade!

That's it! The reason I couldn't concentrate up to now
? before I know it! ?
Keep up the good work.
I can't help falling asleep. I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it!
What do you want?
how about a little obstructive handiwork, just in case?
Ho ho ho, you are a sneaky, nasty man beyond any help!
Whoa, that's cold!
And that's why I'm working so hard.
I know. I've read "My Daughter and I."
I could, if I told him I wouldn't write for his company anymore, or something.

Thanks to you, I can keep working hard. I can keep writing.

What is that thing!?
Oh, my. There's red paper hanging off of everything.
What exactly is going on?
There's nothing more to it. Bankrupt means bankrupt.
This is no time to be explaining things in song.
Come on, let's get going.
Shimura-san, we're really grateful for everything.
We'll be able to see each other again soon, right?
--Of course we will. --Shimura-san...
 We're raking it in just by being alive.

I know this is sudden, but here's a Sana-chan drawing song.
Get your paper and crayon ready!
Please leave!
Hey, Sana-chan, Sagami-san.
We will meet again.

Yo.

Nope.
Your feelings? What feelings, Akito-kun?
Is there somebody in here!?
Thanks for being here with me up to now, everyone.
Goodbye.
That's raking it in, Sana-chan!

I seem like a housewife, don't I?
and your hitter face and hitter feelings hath teeter-fatter,
I finally got him where he's vulnerable!
Where do they get off calling other people ugly with the faces they've got?
Don't you think so, Sana-chan?
Right, right, right! Discriminating, I guess you'd call him.
See? See? See? They're talking highly, they're talking highly.
everything is completely okay, and naturally daff-ay.
You're not listening to me at all, are you?
Ah, what are you kicking it there for!?
It's... not Hayama...
Besides, this is about a different matter.
Rei-kun!
Rei-kun, did you spill some coffee?
A little.
Sana, are you sure you're not feeling out of sorts?
Right, right, that's right!
You're what!?
And now, this week's Sana-chan.
I'm okay.
It's fine.
asking about him with good intentions,
But I'm a good kid, and all.
Look, look, this is freshly autographed!
No!
You burned the curry, you know! I told you to keep an eye on the flame!
It'll be your fault, Akito! Everything is all your fault!
Oh dear, Sana-chan, you're here?
So you do your best, too! See ya!
I don't get her.
Sana-chan!
 Sana-chan said so, so I don't take them off. 
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
he's there.
On the night of the broadcast,
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
why are they canceling now?
Rei-kun, the tea, the tea!
Give me back my omelet roll!
Good morning...
S- Sagami-san!
Um... l- I have to hurry home and flip the switch on my rice cooker...
I'm terribly sorry, Sagami-san!
Aw, he's gone. What was he so agitated about?
Dreaming Pro?
Huh? Exceptionally well?
No, I, Sagami will not be swayed by that.
After all, they could probably market Sana-chan on a larger scale, and all...
Boketsu" means the hole for a grave.
I knew it! So this is Dreaming Pro's doing, is it!?
Ah! Well, bye now!
How crooked those guys are!
an8"I'm the greatest manager in all Japan!!"
--Seconds! --Seconds!
You too, Mama- eating up the food your cute growing daughter needs...
Rei-kun, with that kind of attitude,
an8"The Narrow Path of Enka"
Let's la-go go! Let's la-go!
First there comes a mountain, and then,
Hey, Sana-chan, welcome.
Waah! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
A-ha, is that right? So you are the man from back then, huh? You'll have to excuse me.
Right now, Sana-chan, you have no work to speak of, right?
he will be unable to demonstrate himself as a shrewd manager.
Can't you do something? Please!
Sagami-chan, I'm sorry, maybe next time.
I'm home.
Um, Sana-chan, about your work...
There's nothing not to understand! "Like this" means "like this"!
at this point?
Aloha, Sana-chan!
Now come along quietly!
See you later, fellas!
Well, goodbye!
Sana-chan...
Sana-chan...
Huh? You got me a job!?
you can laugh it away, excuse me, I must be going.
Bye Bye Bye
Wai Wai Wai Wai
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
so Kurata Sana will pitch as hard as she can! Though you know,
"This guy"
"This guy"
This man Gojo- he may be someone that Sana needs.
Now, do you know the name of the woman who he was seeing at that time?
W- what did he say!?
Aww, the house is so new, and look what you've done already.
I'm not a drifter! It's me! Sana! Hurry and open up!
Proof, you say? All right...
Twelve years ago? That means...
Wow! It's been so long since I had one so big! Rumble-bumpers!
I will contact you once I have final confirmation.
Nothing. At the time, that's just what occurred to me.
I'm sorry we're late.
Take-ichani!
What big promotion is that?
I'm all right. I'm sure it's because I haven't eaten.
"Elsewhere, at that moment..."
...and I...
That's enough. It's all in the past for you now.
I really am sorry for this.
Gojo. Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Sana's mother. Thank you for looking after my daughter.
Aah! A man older than me just called me "Mother"!
Incidentally, there are rumors that you crashed the home of a flight attendant...
Yumi, run!
You're right.
Take that, and that!
Dad!
Take-ichani?
You ate right and everything...
Hey, they said you're all right. You surprised me.
Word sure does travel fast, huh?
Take-ichani?
...to variety.
Hang in there until the end, My Darling.
It was "brace yourself!"
I think I might keep puhforming like this forevuh.
These othuh charactuhs are bettuh at portraying humans.
Squished flat, huh?
No!!
Sana-ichan,i
Reii-kuni!
Hayama!
...maybe you shouldn't work so hard on "Chaos Theater," you know?
"Chaos Theater" is just a two-bit program,
I need you.
? There is no end to the days we call tomorrow. ?
there are good reporters and bad reporters.
But it might work out to be a positive thing for me.
You are such a damned fool...
...Kurata Sana's real mother.
You're going to die, and leave things unfinished!
What?
Kurosaki, just this once, I...
Director, would you let me play the part of the father protecting his daughter,
please re-write the script and shoot it again.
I never liked this last scene to begin with!
Ooh, I'm going to cry!
I made it... the last scene...
I made it...
Not yet!
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What's going on? Where's the usual "I'm Kurata Sana" part?
"Graduation project" the graduation ceremony is nearly here.
--Nothing else would leave a greater reminder of who you are. --anyway, anyway, anyway-
Oh... then, what should we do?
Smile, we tricked you!
S- sorry about that.
Relax. I'll always be at your side.
What are you doing? You almost got run over, you know!
Ah, it's snowing.
All for a show such as that!
W- what are you doing, you brat!?
Shut up.
We'll always, always be together.
He said we'd always be together.
Take-ichani!
...and then, we can always stay together.
I'll never go anywhere again.
--Huh? Why not? --Huh? Why not? --Huh? Why not?
Avalanche!
Babbit just wants to appear... even if this is what I have to do...
It proves that I'm alive.
You died, leaving behind so many things that you wanted to do.
"Beware of avalanches" Don't move, don't shout, don't thrash about!
I'm sorry, Mama. I'm okay now.
Oof.
"Merry Christmas"
There is only one reason why we are gathuhed togethuh today,
The public has been talking about what's going on between them.
I would like to hear what you have to say in regards to the truth about them.
so I just thought I could help you to not feel so bad...
Of course. It must sting, huh?
What's with you? Don't get all worked up over something like this.
Mm-hmm! Thanks! That's real friendship!
Doing what?
What did you call me out here to talk about?
W- what!? But you gave all the photos back, didn't you!?
you'll do as I say.
Come on, show it to Big Brothuh!
Make-out!?
What is it? I was just about to confirm something very important.
S- she's on fire...
Oh, isn't that kind of you! Still, I'm very happy you did!
? water comes splashing down from it. ?
? Get two cups ready, ?
? Butterflies come flying in, ?
? Let's draw one more arrow. ?
I... I...
Mm-hmm.
To think we'd have to sneak around like this.
How long is this going to go on?
This is embarrassing...
Keep your arm at your side, make a tight fist, and twist as you...
So that's why...
How can they dignify putting on such a silly act?
"Not cut out to be a pro"
"Merry Christmas" After all, this is my home, and everyone is here waiting for me.
W- what?
--? Merry Christmas, ? --? Merry Christmas, ? --? Merry Christmas, ?
--? be filled with hopes and dreams, ? --? be filled with hopes and dreams, ? --? be filled with hopes and dreams, ?
--? born into this world. ? --? born into this world. ? --? born into this world. ?
Boy B, you've got a one-pace lead, huh?
A present?
--and the others, --Z, it'd be okay for me to tell about when I was carrying on with them, right?
Sagami Rei finally makes his appearance! Finally... finally...
Sorry to keep you waiting. As of next time...
and become a first-year student in middle school.
Morning, Sana-chan. It's a nice day out.
She even won the Aoki Laureate Prize.
Ever since Sana-chan was little, at her mother's suggestion,
It's been a little while since I became a sixth grader, and changed classes.
It's just our class. Our lessons aren't getting anywhere.
Where did my desk go?
And while you're at it, tell the other boys to stop doing this, too!
All right! You go, Tanaka-sensei! You tell them!
and can't even tell the difference between class time and free time--!
What's that self-assured smile all about?
He's the devil! Hayama Akito! He is the devil!
Ah, Rei-kun! What are you shooting!?
You know, Sana-chan, your Manager-sewn has a reputation
for being a nicer man than the other actors.
That dummy needs to get "ba-bing!" socked sometime! Ba-bing! Ba-bing!
Ah, I always watch it. I'll be pulling for you, okay?
So how about this new toim? Are you having a "happy new school yea-uh?"
What are you, stupid?
Even though it's springtime?
It's the absolute worst.
where you either kill, don't kill, or get killed!
"Hazardousurvival?"
Are you listening to me, Hayama!? You stupid monkey,
If only you weren't there!
He's just a big sissy, with shriveled-up nards!
--Well now, I have twelve hours until deadline.
Huh? That was a love song?
Good morning.
T-this w-works p-pretty g-good!
Sana-chan, you should stay home.
Heh? What a simple hunch to figure out! You can just relax.
Eh? Shakey? Huh? Shakey? Shakey? Shakey!?
You're a smart-aleck, just because you're a little bit cute!
I can't let you all get caught in the middle of this. Hurry!
I'm not sure what that means, but I don't like it!
Rei-kun...!
We're really going to pound your face in!
Hayama-san...!
Leave the girl alone.
Toys.
--You're safe? --Sana-chan, are you all right?
Sorry.
These are great!
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
...for two.
What should I do, should I do, should I, should I, Sri Lanka!?
You can't ignore it either.
And this is the fiend who is in my class, 6th Grade 3rd Class, Hayama Akito!
It's unbelievable! Every day, you do the same foolish things!
Hold it!
All he has to say is "hey," and you guys listen to him?
What are you, dogs? Come on, say "woof" for me!
Oh, now I've said it...
Sana-chan, you did it!
Still, I wonder if they'll harass Sana-chan now.
Y- you can't...
--Break out the Mikoshi shrines!
"We'll do it after school."
Hayama and the others can't get close to me!
Mami-chan has been taken away by the boys!
It's not like that...
It's not love or anything, I love... it's girls that I...
I like you, Sana-chan!
Hayama-san is asking you! Go on, tell him.
Mami-chan!
Eh? This is your first time, huh? Congratulations.
But if you can't keep up, you can run away--
Sana-chan, are you all right?
Congratulations! Good luck!
then starting tomorrow, you're going to start having a hard time of it.
It's no use! I can't beat him with force!
There's a goah-geous prize waiting for the winn-uh
 Hayama's weak spot, funya-funya, henyara-honyara 
That's it!
Take this, Hayama! We'll start with a snake!
Even you must be shaking, ready to say "Sana-chan, I give up!"
Huh...?
How do you like this!?
that he doesn't have a single weak spot...?
Come on, spit it out.
I get it! He was laughing me off! I get it, I get it. He got me, he got me.
Stop that!
Take your seats!
If you don't like it, why don't you go call Tanaka-sensei?
Yeah! Yeah! "Help me, Tanaka-sensei!"
Ho ho ho! I can't be caught by the likes of you!
You got it.
Who's being violated!? Don't say such dire things!
Where did that wind come from all of a sudden?
Ah, someone's jersey bottoms.
Akito-kun, this is too cruel.
Rei-kun!
Yes, I'm sorry about this.
I will be more careful from now on.
Right, we will be more careful.
That rotten Hayama...!
What's wrong?
Zing! Is that right!?
You may, but what do you mean, lame? How rude.
Well after all, there's nothing but really weird stuff in here.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
and yet you always shilly-shally,
I'm Gojo. It's a pleasure.
"The Delirious Nick-of-Time Deadline"
...ordinary neighbor girl, who lives in the house behind her!
And so, for today's Language Arts, we'll be writing compositions.
Essay?
The thing is...
I have this much more to do.
and getting hers extended, isn't she?
Where?
--Where? --Look closer! It's there! See? See?
Here, here!
Sana-chan, now what is ill?
"Even after I become an aunt, or a grandma,
There's a picture of Hayama in here!
Bedtime.
What a dirty bastard.
That's pretty wishful thinking.
Ho ho ho, you are a sneaky, nasty man beyond any help!
W- was that a ghost? Was that a ghost?
Kurata...
Doesn't it wear you out?
Cut!
There are some mean characters out there in the world,
Sana-chan, hang in there!
an8"Mother watching over me"
an8"Mother exhaustively watching over me"
S- so sleepy... Maybe I should go to sleep right now...
All right! I'll be back soon!!
Whoops! Whoops! I went too far!
Stop, Mr. Onda.
Bye now.
You dumbass! You good-for-nothing!
you can laugh it away, excuse me, I must be going.
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Gwaenchansseumnida, kwenchanaym
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Why is Gojo-san in my bed!?
You can't ignore it either.
Let's settle on a winner and a loser here once and for all!
"Class is over..."
Okay, Eri-chan! Rumi-chan!
What's with that anxious look on your face--?
Are you running away, Hayama?
Oh, is that right? Nice if that were true.
Hayama-san, are you going to let her say that?
Do it, please!
Fine!
They wouldn't, ordinarily.
He said "Ooh," right? He just said "Ooh," right?
Ah, damn! She's adopting a strange pose!
...but as far as falling from anyplace high...
"Sana-chan Sings"
Sana-chan, if you keep working yourself up like this,
Would you stop with your disgusting consolations!?
Uncle.
What exactly is the matter here? You look positively gloomy, Sensei.
Why don't you tell me everything, Sensei?
How lewd!
For teachers to be making out with each other at school comes as a great shock.
--Make-out! Make-out! Mambo! Make-out! --You don't have to dance, just listen to me.
Ah, thanks.
Sana-chan, you're the type that gets taken in by form, huh?
Now then, how shall we lure him out, Washington-kun?
I think that's his older sister's voice.
Get out of this house right now!
You... devil! You're the devil!
Somehow... I'm surprised...
Oh, what happened to your hand there?
Oh, here it comes! Whoo, what's this!? Stupidity uncovered!
S- Sana-chan! I'm off!
Now, then...
How about you hand over that picture of the teachers?
...up to now, just for today,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
Yuck! That's some yucky, yucky business!
an8"Lone Wolf, Awooo!"
That rumor that I love you
as well as my boyfriend and pimp!
"Lone Wolf, Awooo!"
This is all of them?
Okay, Hayama-kun, you realize how much trouble you've caused us, right?
You don't get it, do you!?
I'm sorry. I won't do it any more.
That does it, right?
You break your promise, and you're stripped!
"Thump! Thump! Thump!"
...she got the pictures away from him! Okay?
"A peaceful class"
Oooooh...
Hayama! You broke your promise, didn't you!?
What?
an8"Retiring"
What's so funny!?
Up until yesterday, you were kissing up to me.
Starting today, I'm the boss!
H- Hayama...
Wha--?
But still, violence is wrong.
Okay, let's use the pattern marked with the "X."
Sana-chan, do you know where Akito-kun is?
No, I don't. What's wrong?
I was supposed to meet up with him, but he's not here.
A lone wolf who's given up being boss monkey!
Sana-chan, it's your turn.
Here goes!
Ee-yow-ow-ow! An actress' face is her life!
Just you being here makes me sick!
Hurry up and get out of here, I'm telling you!
He's going to go eat dinner by himself...
Pink, strong tea, and the reverse choke-hold.
Run away!
 that there were really families who were that cold to each other... 
H- he's settled down, right?
Ah, please do.
H- Hayama...!
that's neither here nor there...
Right, right! Don't get discouraged!
Sorry. My chop was too hard. It's tricky getting the control right.
I love my Mama, too, after all.
There must be something going on inside that house.
All these issues...
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
All right!
Sagami Rei-kun. He's hath my chauffeur and my manager,
"However, as for Sana-chan"
"Let's all go see!"
Ghastly!
Ghastly!
Good grief!
It makes me think he's not all that bad a guy.
Hayama-kun's an adult, all right!
See? See? See? They're talking highly, they're talking highly.
I've already seen enough of your ugly faces, after all.
Nyaah!
let's do something about it, and make things more pleasant.
If there's anything I can do to help, would you tell me?
Mm-hmm.
It's no use for us to try talking about it, is it?
Never mind!
What? What? What is this? What's the matter? What happened?
But never mind that-- Sana, why are you wearing an apron?
There. All done!
Oh, this sure looks easy to digest, huh?
--I'm not going to worry about you any more! --Actually, Sensei messed up.
No! Watch out!
I'm okay.
What?
Well, don't force it on me, it's annoying!
All the other kids have already finished their parent-teacher conferences!
All the others' parents have come, I said! This is my last year of middle school!
Everything is your fault!
So then, let's get going with our hour here!
That's Zenjiro-chan's autograph, right? Is that a present for someone?
Mm-hmm. All right, it's been bugging me so much thinking about this,
It can't go on like this, Hayama.
I'll do my best in this drama!
I don't get her.
 I am Rei-kun, waiting in the car. 
 When nighttime comes, it's dark all around, 
and I wasn't very enthusiastic about doing it.
and Hayama's family will have a happy end, too! That's it!
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Okay, the taping for the drama has begun, and I'm giving my best!
I'm Kurata Sana, age 11.
Huh? I've got a funny feeling about what's going to happen...
"Pretty close..."
Akito-kun really believed himself to be the devil up until about the second grade.
Remember, how earlier, how Akito-kun did those overly nasty things to Mami-chan?
Hayama, the devil! The devil's boy!
So, Sana-chan, you should understand that. Akito-kun isn't...
--it's no wonder why Hayama would be so perverse, is it!? --Hold on... Sana-chan...
--What a stupid father and daughter they are! --Sana-chan...
 Off I go, pressing forward, Kurata Sana! 
I'm off, Mama!
Go at it the best that you can.
Good little kids, have a shot of Spopotamin!
 My trembling heart answered me, 
Ah, Sana-chan, you're so cute!
What are you tawlking about?
--"Welcome." It's right here in the script. --be sure to watch the broadcast!
I was so happy!
That's strange.
U- um... K- Kurata Sana. It's nice to-- to have the occasion to meet you.
Kurumi-san, do you have a moment?
Say, what kind of drama is it?
I've had enough!
It hurts to be told that, even when we're acting.
What are you doing, Rei-kun?
You're probably wondering what's going on, right?
Hmm? Aren't you Akito's...
Devil...?
Are you still playing dumb!?
Kurumi-san!
Kurumi-san!
If I was in a family where I was raised, being called "devil, devil,"
 Once you see it, you'll be happy-py! 
Fight time has arrived! Hayama Family, this is the last time I'm going to ask you!
And after I told him that much that you should watch it together!
Mr. Hayama?
and in order to relieve his stress, he has to vent it at school!
but what about yourselves? You dummy father-and-daughter...
Hey, Hayama!
After everything I said! Why!? Why!? Why!? Why!?
Say, Hayama...
I'm your mother... your mother... your mother... your mother... your mother...
Mika...
keep at it, and go on living, okay, A-chan?
Ah, you see?
His father's back was so big,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
You can't ignore it either.
I'm Kurata Sana, age 11.
A-chan, about your Mama...
Oh, by the way, this fine man with the sunglasses is my manager,
And this episode seems to be one that develops her some more!
I probably wouldn't say it went that well,
Sana-chan... wasn't it?
Porridge, for me?
Hot! So I can't make any guarantees about the flavor. Hot! Hot!
Oh no, I'm going to be late for school!
From now on, you'll eat dinner at home.
Dad doesn't particularly mind, either. Bye.
It feels like we just had quite a conversation...
But anyway, it was like... it was like... it was like...
you know what I mean? Yeah? You know what I mean?
Mm-hmm. A family has to get along with itself, huh?
Thank you so much.
And so, for Mama's sake, keep at it, and go on living, okay?
Why?
What are you up to?
Hey there, it's been three days. You're over your cold. That's great.
Well, I guess devils don't turn into angels overnight.
Then you must want to meet Tamorin!
Rei-kun is sick!
Could you go to your interview today by yourself?
Crazy mixed-up one-shot fight Supopotamin!
Evil spirit possessing Rei-kun, come out at once!
Don't tell me Rei-kun... is suffering from some incurable illness!
And it's not that.
How can you talk to your daughter that way!?
Come back soon.
I need to be taking it back to the office soon,
He said he was going to wait in the car, so he's in the underground parking lot.
She usually does her head up that way.
I'm just second-counting what she says in her novels and stuff.
And what do you call a bargain sale?
The fact is, you see, I found him and picked him up in Shinjuku.
but I thought that if he worked at it properly, he would look good.
Feminine intuition...!
and had had a terrible string of misfortunes.
It's already recorded!
But then Rei-kun knew what time I would be with Asako-san,
It's been a long time. You've been avoiding me, haven't you? All this time...
Hold on, now!
...for two.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
when the children go home,
What? What? What? What are you to Rei-kun?
No matter what others may say, right now,
"A Juice-Drenched First Kiss"
Excuse me for showing my regular face.
Asako!
--Ah, there you are! --Oh, and when you could see the moon,
--What are you doing, Asako-chan? --on those dates,
--Hurry, we have a car waiting over here. --you wore a lucky evening primrose...
Asako-chan, hurry!
I can trust you, right, Rei-kun?
I'm scattering flowers about!
I was laughing. Him, a boyfriend? He's just pretending, you know.
Otherwise, would he collect all of those clippings of her?
he tried to put a curse on her, to kill her!
Huh? Where's Sagami-kun?
I ducked him and came home myself.
you were talking about earlier with me!
Huh? You're kidding. I don't get it.
Akito-kun, wait! Excuse us. Wait up! Explain this to me from the top!
You said I was your rival, didn't you?
This is a good opp-uh-tunity.
Hold on a minute. Today, Sana-chan is absent, isn't she?
I'm late!
to take a look at ourselves.
all you can see are teeth, and you'd say...
Rei-kun!
You were late, right? It's not good to be late for work.
Rei-kun!
Rei! Call me! I want to talk! Rei, make sure you call me! I'll be waiting!
Depressing...
 Yes, I welcome you. 
 Actresses whose faces are their lives should smile! 
 It's stunningly high, so Hayama will be scared. 
I've been there a bunch of times myself.
What's with you? You're so gloomy, Tsuyoshi-kun!
What are you talking about?
Amazing, Sana-chan!
This elevator travels 45 floors in approximately 55 seconds,
we won't be able to live in the middle of this huge earth, you know?
That's what I'm saying, to put it simply.
Let me join in, too.
I know you told me not to come for you...
I- I really meant for nothing bad to happen to you, see?
of course. It must sting, huh?
And our usual classroom...
What's going on!? What happened!?
That rumor that I love you
Sagami Rei-kun. He's my manager, as well as my boyfriend and pimp.
Babbit.
who is causing trouble yet again!
Maybe I'm just imagining it, that's what I think,
Wha--
There are observation lounges on both the north and south sides...
What's that? What is it? What is it? Let's go see!
She stepped on Onda.
Hmm, I don't quite understand all of this.
 If possible, pretend it didn't happen. 
among the Social Studies field trip students, and was worried about you.
I'm glad you're safe, Sana-chan.
You pressed it, all right!
A-ha! So, you're here, Hayama!
It's so stupid, I'm speechless.
I was there at the time! I bet 10 yen on whether or not you could do it.
Don't get so full of yourself!
Okay, that's enough.
You've gotten strong, haven't you, Mitsuya-sensei?
Oh, right! Before I forget, here's this week's Sana-chan.
Hayama...
Hey.
--Give the boy a piece. --C- cake? Eh?
Oh! Hayama used polite language!
Here you go. Take your time.
Maro-chan, demonstrate for him.
...is very neat, so he does not excrete in the place where he sleeps.
How come you're coming out of my house!?
The fans are awl gonna be disappointed if they can't see your face, Sana-chan.
--I saw the special drama you were in earlier myself. --Oh! S- Sana-chan! The TV! The TV!
Well, he is at that "bankokki" international flags, after all.
You mean "hankoki" rebellious age?
Aren't you... Kurumi-san?
That's right. But after that, I lost my parents in an accident--
and the house was taken from me.
You turned your back on me!
when you told me out of the blue that you wanted to be an actress?
In dire straits,
...up to now, just for today,
And our usual classroom...
Rei...
--in the house!?
I was talking to Rei-kun!
What is this!? What's going on!? What's going on, I said!
What's the matter?
Sagami-kun, that's your way of showing consideration for Sana, huh?
Begging your pardon, but Sensei, please come to a realization yourself, and fast!
Sana-chan is stranger than usual today.
No! Let me go, Big Brother! No!
Wow, how cute.
You think it would be okay if I secretly switched it with Aono-chan's egg?
There was something that Mama said to me this one time!
Which brings us to your egg, Aono-chan!
I wand-uh if something's bothering her.
Answer me, would you?
Rei-kun, you said you wouldn't have anything to do with Asako-san, right?
Then, it is...
Sana-chan, that's not--
You're just a simple child! Just like with this children's lunch!
I'm feeling so good right now, I'm going to be especially generous!
It turns out that Rei-kun was just treating me like a child.
Ha, didn't I tell you so? You finally caught on, huh?
You're right.
--...sickening. --...comical.
I'm so embarrassed, I can't go home!
You were the scum of the class, after all.
I just can't put it out of my head, you know?
If you don't hate him, then give him a kiss!
an8"Welcome back, Sana"
Shimura-san knocked herself out making Thai-style eggplant-and-shrimp curry.
You can get back with Asako-san.
I'll be all right, so...
...am I crying...?
an8but until that day, but until that day, stay by my side.
In dire straits,
...for two.
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Love had at last come to an end for our heroine.
I'll be all right, so...
--The next day, --After school today, you have an Odabutsu-land commercial to shoot.
What's this!?
S- seven!?
Sana-chan, I failed you as a boyfriend.
She's not listening.
What's the use? I'll do them.
Babbit took all the leftover ice cream!
You booked more commercial work?
I'm not so flavorless a girl as to treat men that I've broken up with
Yes?
Asako-san, you pushed Rei-kun away, so you could live for your work,
You scatterbrain!
"Skinny."
Anyone there? Hello? Yohoseyo? Paki nyo ha?
Father Hayama, no! It can't be...!
Come on, raise those eyebrows.
Just kidding. By the way, where's Sagami-kun?
I've been waiting for an answer.
to always go along with the scenario.
Sheesh! Rei-kun, you've booked too much work for me!
Okay, let's hammer these out! But "boo" on doing any more than that!
Whether you're awake or asleep,
Hayama, be strong.
"Dappi" is a little bit different from the skin that peels awf your body
Ba-bing, bye-bye, sayonara!
Will we make it in time?
What!?
You betcha! I hail from Gekidan Komawari, after all!
Okay, this is a take! I'd like to shoot this while it's still daylight,
Ah, that's right.
Sana-chan, run the way you would!
Whew, this is hard.
I guess shooting commercials for two weeks straight has been rough on her.
nicknamed "The Fireball Girl," Kurata Sana?
 "That water strider is blue," A - I - U - E - O. 
 Boko-boko, "Inside the dust is a little squirt." 
And with that, my vocalization practice is down cold.
"Bothersome."
Hayama and Oki apparently got angry at the other boys
Hayama...
Well, would you not run amuck,
Say, which one do you think is best?
Sana-chan, I think that you like working more than you like us.
Really? I'm so glad!
They're burying the hatchet already? How boring.
Ah, now that you mention it, I haven't seen him.
"Terrible?"
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
"Kodomo no Omocha"
DAIJO-BU!
Sana-chan?
You're still not completely awake.
Sana-chan, you're awake. Good morning.
Aah! What is Gojo-san doing in my bed!?
No, this is my bed.
What is Gojo-san's bed doing in my home!?
--How could I have committed such an indiscretion --Disgracefuloose?
No...
Good morning.
'Course he's not.
Don't say "I love you"! Good grief, what a girl!
Nope. Take-chan, your same old magic tricks get 0 points.
Okay, out! 20 minute break.
That's a line dance.
I just can't make it tomorrow.
Why not!? Why not!?
 If you all want to laugh at me, I'll make an allowance. 
 I'll dance on the dresser for Guidance. 
I can't get into Kaimei.
I'll get a tutor for you, like we did for your brother.
I'm home.
You don't say, you don't say.
Shinichi-san you can do it if you try.
Please be quiet.
Sana-chan, you're late.
I can do it myself.
Rei-kun!
Thanks to Zenjiro-san.
You're getting more wrinkles.
If he tests for another school, then even if he is rejected,
he will forfeit his eligibility to advance to Jinbo Middle School.
Shinichi-san!
Shinichi-san!
My word, what kind of parent is that? For mercy's sakes!
You guys really do think a lot of your teachuh.
for someone still in elementary school like you are,
Wow, during location shoots at night when our waiting times are this long,
You know, my snot is collecting in my mustache, and it's freezing there.
Oh? Is he really that smart?
Get on with it.
Hey...
Welcome home.
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
Gomi-kun, you've got it all wrong!
Oh, but Gomi-kun just keeps sticking his feet even deeper into the swamp.
Whether you're awake or asleep,
when the children go home,
What was your name again...?
Which is why I thought we should go over to Tsuyoshi's house and see, right away.
"Enter Tsuyoshi-kun's father!!"
Yeah, I mean, we're divorced and all, now. They're not my concern.
Hey, that's taking it a bit far. At least he has a combov-beep...
What did you call me!?
Over-the-hill cue ball! Over-the-hill cue ball!
Hey, you, hold it!
but as we were leaving his house earlier,
No.
Tsuyoshi could have gotten hurt, too.
Whoa! Don't come any closer!
we should have a grown man there, too.
An artist that defines the culture of the day
Aono-chan!
--It was no trouble at all. --If you want to thank me, give me money--
I- I bowed my head, and all this water started coming out... I hate this...
Don't tell Aono or my mom, okay? Don't tell them I was crying.
Hey! Don't be presumptuous!
Sana-chan, you're good friends with Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
 Wavy-wavy-wave! 
...is an extreme worrywart!
an8"That's not it"
but I hope you'll continue to regard me the same as you always have.
I love Tsuyoshi-kun!!
But Tsuyoshi likes Kurata, right?
Tsuyoshi, Sugita would be a better match for you than Kurata.
Seriously, what's so good about Kurata?
I was in a different class in 5th grade! I didn't give you anything!
Thank you, Zenjiro-sensei!
Big Brother, happy birthday!
That's okay. I'm over Sana-chan now.
happy birthday, Tsuyoshi-kun!
Tomorrow, at school.
Some friends helped us out, so it's almost done.
Oh, is that right?
Father, how are you eating, and stuff?
Mm-hmm.
...panic!!
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Sagami Rei-kun, my chauffeur and manager, and former boyfriend.
Really, that's all there is to it.
One of them was that I would become a famous novelist.
When will it be published?
I see...
--Sana-chan is going, woo-hoo-hoo! --Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
The girls in 3rd Class are a bit ostentatious,
don't you think, Mitsuya-sensei?
Now, now, Ando-sensei, it's too early in the morning to be getting worked up.
Have you heard about the poor quality of 3rd Class!?
It's Narunaru!
You're one astounding idiot, huh?
Three days and two nights.
So, did you want something?
Oh, really!?
 Outdoors, outdoors, hello to you! 
You can have the fatty part.
It's like Kurata doesn't have a care in the world.
Say, let's all stay up until morning!
--Absolutely! --Okay! Okay!
...but all of you ended up falling asleep.
Ah, this is no fun.
Guess I'll go to the bathroom.
Yeah, constipation has me over a barrel.
Sushi?
That goes the same for you, Mitsuya-sensei, right?
--that these students let things go to their heads! --I don't hate it.
All right, let's go back and wake everyone up, Hayama.
Right! Right! It'll be fine-fine! Ha ha ha, ha!
they, er, engage in extremely precocious activities!
What are precocious activities?
There's no soy sauce.
--on the second day of outdoor school. --What were you doing last night?
 Friend-- 
Well, Sana-chan, you were absent 'cause of your outdoo-ah school,
Zenjiro-chan! Uchiyamada-kun!
Principal!
Amazing!
That can't be right!
A cliff?
Oh, no! With just the two of us in a place like this, I'm...
...going to be violated!
Give it up, until it gets quiet up there.
If you tell me not to do it, I won't, dummy.
What are you talking about? That's silly!
Something has happened, hasn't it?
Mama is writing an essay on me... all about me...
...the enjoyable life that Mama and I share...
I've been waiting for an answer.
he's there.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
After following after a firefly, I fell down a cliff.
My favorite expression is "Boo an being slapdash. "
as well as my former boyfriend... and former pimp?
But then, whoops! Behind him was a really boneheaded father-daughter team!
But Sana-chan's strategies won out against them, too!
What are you doing!?
 Thoroughly refreshing outdoor school! 
 Are you ready!? Are you ready!? 
How come Hayama is the only one who noticed?
A-chan, about your Mama...
Besides, there's no way your mom could hate you.
Yes. As Sana-chan's manager, I'd like to know.
What is that?
Yeah, a happy circle? How so?
Ah, what are you remembering that's making you laugh!?
Nothing? You said it was a story about me, didn't you?
Tell me! Come on, come on, come on!
I may not look it... but I am awfully grateful to you.
Ah! You smiled! You just smiled, Hayama! You grinned!
but you just grinned!
Now you're embarrassed! This is the first time I've ever seen that!
But you just barely smiled, didn't you?
Oh, you got away! You got away this time! Hold up!
 One-two, one-two! 
 Won't you smile for me? One more time, one more time! 
How do you like this!?
My face is just laughing on its own.
How cute! How cute! I know...!
--By the way, I'm playing the heroine this year! --Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom!
--Bocari is a hit! Bocari Sweet! --Huh? It's Sana-chan again.
Don't talk to the TV.
Just kidding! New Kid's Foam, now on sale!
Accident insurance, just in case!
--I'll be acting with a boy who's the same age as us. --Come on, come on, this way, this way...
Awesome!
--Say, could you get me his autograph? --They say he's a bishonen. I wonder what type.
I wonder if he's like the ones in girls' manga,
Oh, Hayama, yoo-hoo!
Disinfect yourself too long in there, and your hiney will melt away!
The enjoyable life that Mama and I share now...
Sounds interesting! I think I'll reserve a copy!
Ta-da! Well? How do you like my commercial costume?
Wow! He's even prettier than me when I'm in makeup!
You idiot! Not like that!
--I am a genius at this, after all! --He's the boy who was in that one recent drama,
Nice work!
They said you can keep this. Here.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
Gekidan Komawari is putting on a play, and my heart is pounding!
Whether you're awake or asleep,
called "My Daughter and I."
It was Naozumi-kun that said to me...
H- hold up!
But listen! I have a weakness for fried shrimp!
that was just something that happened by accident!
I don't have any other secrets.
So, what do you want?
What kind of person are you!?
Never mind the details, just look.
Yes. I always carry these around with me.
Oh, so you do indeed like me, huh? I get it! You're one of my fans!
--for your next job! --I have to go.
Until the book comes out, watch yourself.
Sensei!
 Thinking about it won't do any good! 
Ah, I came to pick up a manuscript.
I- I couldn't!
By Aoki Prize-winning author... Kurata Misako...
Thunderboy comes down out of the sky,
Here, it's done. "The Adventures of Thunderboy."
"What a pain..."
Is that right? She's busy, huh?
Uh, hello? I'm Zenjiro here! I'm Zenjiro, the guy who is on TV a lawt! Excuse me!
I'm getting sick of this anime.
Sana-chan must have invited everyone she knows, huh?
I knew it!
Hayama?
Oh, you mean swallowing a person! I know it, I know it!
Oh no! Crap! I wrote the character for "enter"!
Okay, everybody, let's break a leg!
Akito-kun, that guy is coming this way.
just to do commercials earns her eight figures.
Magnificent, Sana-chan! Her brilliance comes naturally to her.
No? But I just had my hawt broken. Please?
--Hayama-kun, would you pick that up for me? --You want to break up?
...is what it looks like, and then, bu-chaa!
Why don't you take up karate?
As it happens, a friend of mine is opening up a new branch dojo.
There's no way Akito-kun would do anything that takes that kind of resolve.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
so BOY, take a look my way!
All I want to know is how Mama feels. And yet, Hayama is acting cold!
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 17; the fated series finally reaches its climax!
when the children go home,
Mama, the Aoki Prize-winning writer.
--No, Sana-chan is coming from this direction! --Sana-chan is incredibly popular, huh?
Please don't pull me!
Thank you, thank you, everyone. Thanks for your support.
Huh!? Hayama is taking karate!?
That perverse Hayama doing karate? Someone that warped...?
Idiot?
She was sublime and valiant! So pretty and charming, like a goddess!
Right.
--Scatter! --All right!
What? What's this?
but I don't have a single penny to give to you!
Whenever I see that man, I'm struck by how foolish I was in my youth,
-- Garlicky-licky-licky whoo!  -- once he forgets. 
Kurata Sana-san, who is currently appearing in several commercials,
There was a whole pile of books delivered to me over there,
Must be a slow day for everyone.
--I learned that it would be difficult for me to have children. --We need to repaint the estate gate soon.
--That gave me a great inferiority complex. --The plants also need to be pruned.
for which I received the Aoki Prize, so if anyone is interested,
"I started by making my hairstyle as strange as I could,
After the baby had been in the hospital for a week,
but at least become a little more famous than other children.
Then, the two of us will try to call out to your real mother.
It may be a bit of a drawn-out battle, though.
Her mother isn't her real mother.
I didn't say anything.
To me, everything that you are saying is clichd, and sure enough,
Hayama...
Oh, I'm surprised you can say that.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
...panic!!
...for two.
Is there anything I can eat? Let's check the fridge...
Hayama!
Don't you lie to me! You're just a letch!
Huh...? Suddenly, I feel sleepy...
but one of them said it was only because of her mother's influence.
Hello, is this the Kurata-san residence? This is Hayama...
Yes, I appreciate it.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's all right.
Hey, you sure slept well, Sana-chan.
Really, I still have the figure of a little girl.
"Three stars down there..."
That's right. They're like the three stars in the Orion constellation.
There aren't very many photos of Hayama... are there...?
--Right! --Right!
Get this. She's got three moles on her--
Sana-chan has three moles on her--
I couldn't sleep.
Let's see...
I'd like...
Ramen, ramen, ramen, ramen!
You jerk!
Hey, I hear that Zenjiro's new girlfriend is 2m 50cm tall.
"Person's weight"
Oh, I'm Zenjiro's manager, Higashiyamato Sanekichi--
an8"Zenjiro's Room"
--Faw, faw away, to my planet. --Be back soon!
Okay then, everyone, good evening.
--Ah, it's Zenjiro-san!
I found it!
A little time will solve everything.
you wouldn't do anything, right?
You don't trust me, huh?
From what Mama says, there's only about a five percent chance of us finding her.
Mama wants to meet her.
I've been worrying about that... all this time...
If you don't want that, then you can just tell them you don't want to, can't you?
who do have both their parents.
He's just trying to protect Sana-chan, isn't he?
--It's not usually something you'd go public with, huh? --I've dragged Naozumi-kun into this, now.
an8"Manager's head"
That can't be helped. Right now, he is closer to Sana-chan than I am.
But I will protect Sana-chan in my own way.
I'm trying to pass you off as a bishonen, and that just looks weird!
 I'm staying home at the Hayama house! 
Please contact me as soon as possible.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 19; the fated series reaches its conclusion.
You can't ignore it either.
when the children go home,
after a lot of wrangling.
And this is Mama. My beloved Mama.
My real mother has been found... My real, birth mother...
Yes.
You do realize that that just isn't so, right?
She says her name is Sakai Keiko-san. She knew about your three stars.
That doesn't even make sense!
--And hey, how come you guys have all fallen flat? --It's your fault, you know.
an8"Sana-chan sings"
Oh, sorry. It's just so rare for this boy to laugh.
I'd better take a picture before I forget!
It's okay, isn't it?
So, do you have any children?
What are you apologizing for?
I have a younger sister!
You're happy about that? Good for you.
I see.
Is that all right?
He's been terribly worried about you.
Hey, how is Sana-chan doing!?
Mm-hmm, sure! Tsuyoshi-kun too.
Ah, my back hoits... ah, my back hoits...
It's perfect, Zenjiro-sensei.
That's why you came over to my house, right?
Hurry, hurry!
Oh, shh, okay? I'm undercover today.
Whew, this is fun, huh, Akito-kun?
Waugh! I won't say it again!
--Oh, yeah? Mariko-chan, you can read books? --However, I'm sure that what I'm feeling
Akito-kun! Akito-kun! Isn't this fun!?
That...
When I think about... what if you hadn't given birth to me,
it really frightens me. After all, if you hadn't... I wouldn't...
I'm home!
It must have been rough, huh?
to tell you everything... while you were so little...
Mama has been worried, too...?
That night, I slept together with Mama.
It'sh all sho eashy for you...
let's rebuild the house!
Fine, whatever...
Sana-chan, do you have anything to say about your mother's book?
Yo.
"Back against the wall."
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...panic!!
...for two.
What was the only line that Zenjiro-san said
Feeling Good With a Sana-chan Quiz!
"Feeling Good With a Sana-chan Quiz!"
Well, good luck.
Yes, yes, right away!
Okay then, let's start by watching this VTR.
If you think this is over, then you're one greatly mistaken yelping fox!
Anatomical model!
Here it is!
You're kidding!
What's this?
How did you know that!?
Hayama-kun is awff to a good stawt!
So now you're my counselor? That's a lot of trouble you're going to.
Oh, I never!
Hayama, what are you, the Quiz King?
Hayama-kun is winning awl alone! Everyone else has to try hawduh.
Sana-chan, what happened to all that relish you were taking at the beginning?
Listen, why don't I pretend like I'm your mother?
What was the single line that Zenjiro-chan,
--Hayama-san... --He's being overpowered!
Rei...
You called?
I see...
Sana-chan, aren't you rushing it?
Okay then, what's your answuh?
The question is, what did Hayama do after this?
If you answer the next question correctly,
--Right! --What?
You have a visitor. We're coming in.
At any rate, right now, Sana-chan is the most important thing to me.
Can I wait for you?
She came inside the house!? So, what is it with her!?
That's nuts.
...I'm terribly embarrassed about.
I get pretty embarrassed when I think about the way I was a little while ago.
N- now that you mention it...
I'll be all right, so...
Now then, for the final question.
Why is this?
Ah! Sane-yan!
In dire straits,
I've been waiting for an answer.
...panic!!
...for two.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
he's there,
Sana-chan might go wild after all this time--
Whether you're awake or asleep,
"Could Be a Small-Size Hayama"
and I'm finally back to my normal life.
an8"Set your sights! Inter-Show Hidden Talent Competition Victory! 1,000,000 prize!"
Above awl, you've got to let go of yourself, and fight with spirit.
Got that?
"That's because you're a nice person,
They say that your lucky day is the best day for a date!
That must be it. Naozumi-kun, don't you ever feel like looking for your parents?
Nope. As far as parents and family goes,
I've got plenty of them at Kamura Academy, after all.
I guess not.
Do-la-fa-la fa-la-so-la mi-do-re-mi-do!
I shouldn't remember this place at all,
and yet somehow, it's all terribly familiar.
Everyone, calm down, calm down! Calm down!
N- nice to meet you.
Nah, I wouldn't go that far!
--I've gotten so I can do this...
Still, I was surprised at the Sannas. It almost sounds like a monster.
Sorry for all the hullabaloo, but when I told them that Sana-chan would be coming,
everyone got all excited, and said they were going to throw a reception for you.
This is Naozumi-kun when he was little?
Help yourself to as much of whatever you like.
 this is Sana-chan's first composition! 
S- strutting around...?
That stare... that defiant attitude...
This kid is the spitting image of Hayama!
This kid is the spitting image of Hayama!
Sorry, Sana-chan. He's kind at heart, but not very well-behaved.
What was that, Sana-chan?
Sorry, I don't have time to entertain you right now.
Get here in three seconds! Got that!? You have to!
Sure is handy, being an anime.
Who is Hayama?
There's that one there!
Earlier, she forgot that we even existed.
Hey! Hold it!
Sana-chan, enough.
Come! Feel the breeze!
--Big Brother Nao is falling apart!
I can see right through your weakness!
and doesn't want people to see you in an embarrassing way.
Power up!
Don't you look cool now, exposed little boy?
I guess boys around this age don't have any sense of shame, huh?
See? See? You've got the exact same ill-humored mouth as him!
Hayama, when did you get here?
"Wel--"
Shut up.
but let's try having the reception again at the beach!
--I'm Yui! --I'm Suehiro Ruriko-- I'm Ayumi.
 It was a spiteful performance, 
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
from anyone's viewpoint.
Whether you're awake or asleep,
"Heart of Karate and Announcement of Retirement"
Okay, Sana-chan, if I win this hand, then...
I get to have a barbecue out in the yard with Aya-chan and the others,
Hm hm hm... This is for the match, Rei-kun.
an8"Sana!" "Rei-kun"
Come on, come on.
Okay, I'll take that one. That's the game.
I've seen enough.
Hayama, huh?
 --Karaoke, whoa, whoa!  --I'm no good...
 --The barbecue-cue is lit,  --I'm no good...
This is Narunaru.
Sana-chan, want to go, too?
Take this, and this, and this, thief!
I don't need this.
And, while you're occupied with that, it's composition time!
Here's this week's Sana-chan!
I heard that Japanese girls are good at karate,
 Chop! Chop! Chop! Hot stuff! Karate chop! 
What kind of attitude is that!? Ka-blam!!
Sana-chan, you're even worse than me.
Sana-chan is doing karate, too.
...more like this, or more like this, or more like this!?
can last in this kind of restrained training.
and the path to martial arts in the same category.
A thousand times, I hate it!
--I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! --Why are you saying such a childish thing?
Sana-chan, what's the mattuh?
We awl go through hawd times. We awl get sad.
I'm not having a hard time goo-goo. I'm not sad about anything either, goo-goo.
Sana-chan, this is my fault. I was wrong.
Mm-hmm...
an8"Yikes!"
so you needn't worry.
Sensei...
I am in her debt for rescuing me when I was homeless.
Thank you!
Rei-kun!
I won't have to put up with turning down playing with everyone,
T- take this plane back to Japan, right now!
Please stop!
I fell down.
Is that right? Be careful.
G- get out of the way!
Later.
Hayama...
Hayama, if you want to do karate, then I... I want to...
You're going to make me sad, too.
keeping your head directly above your hind end.
I've been waiting for an answer.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
...for two.
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
My beloved Mama is a novelist.
Gomi Shinichi, one of Hayama's followers-
Damn! It hurts!
 Hayama's road is winding and strays, 
-- naked eyes-eyes... 
--Now he's saying things that don't make any sense! --Kitchen garbage, construction worker,
Ah, this is such a fine household.
You did, huh? You watched it? Watched what?
--Ew, ugh! Ew, ugh! Ew, ugh! --and just a little bit timid...
Hisae-chan...
That's right.
Is Gomi-kun here?
How come?
Aw, I'm bored.
Tch, I'm short.
Don't you know right from wrong!?
Hayama Akito has been shoplifting!?
Gossip about Hayama! Gossip about Hayama!
so I'm going to ask you directly-
The fact remains that an incident of shoplifting did take place!
Aya-chan, thank you.
S- sure.
an8"Pass"
an8"Gossip"
Someone of as few words as Hayama-san wouldn't say anything, about that, right?
It wasn't Hayama-san... It wasn't Hayama-san who ratted on me!
You have a telephone call from your son.
Dad! I'm sorry!
I'm... I'm... I'm the one who... I'm the one who...
I'm the one who shoplifted!!
No making cracks right now!
You stood up for Shinichi right up to the end,
Both my wife and I became overeager,
Don't forget to take that jacket of yours home tonight.
We really are terribly sorry for this. Good night.
I'm...
We've been waiting for five hours.
I can also write with it.
Gomi-kun has stopped coming to school.
--What?
For self-defense. You want to use one too?
Don't mess with us!
and your body will be healthy,
so resolve when to give up
U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
I've got nationwide valentines!
in all of Japan,
Love just doesn't suit our class.
"See a weakness in others, mend the weakness in yourself.
You can win like this?
Yes, this has been a taping
of "Child's Toy."
No! I mean she's cute, like she was my little sister!
are you sure it was okay for you to say that?
--Yay! Yay! Yay! --Go to commoicial!
Really? That's terrific.
"The next day, 'Child's Toy' was on location, too"
Back up, back up!
No, Mawiko is still pwaying.
Will Mariko be all right?
So, Sana-chan will be traveling by the location bus?
Mariko!
Really, where could she have gone off to?
Do you have any ideas where she would go?
I'm sorry, I never intended to call you again,
But I've got this feeling like I shouldn't be doing this.
Fine, go home. Take it easy.
Aw, that was rough! Today has really worn me out!
Mister!
Mister!
Today, we have the always-cheerful Kurata Sana-chan, from "Child's Toy."
"I'm just a little bit hungry!"
And now, the day has come
First comes rice!
There's still time!
Keiko-san!
My husband, Mariko's father.
she's been saying she was going to see Sana-chan,
I left Mariko all alone, and went back inside the house.
Let's look for her! Mariko-chan must be inside the station!
I wonduh if the rental is here...
--Have you seen Mariko-chan? --She's a cute little girl.
She hath not come hither.
Dear!
but when it comes to Mariko, it's almost as if he becomes a different person.
--Mariko! --Mariko-chan!
Akito-kun, you're not very good at reading codes, huh?
Yeah!
You're going to sing?
Lights on!
You're sure?
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Sure.
Speaking of which, Sana-chan, what are you going to do about middle school?
an8"That's still a long way off..."
Sensei, what's the matter?
Madam, what on earth are you talking about?
A te---st!
Listen up, everyone!
I'm sorry!
Are you okay with this, Principal!?
I'm sure those children resent me, and despise me.
However... however... if I must, I will play the ogre!
Aah, this is lame. After-school class?
You boys have done nothing but get in the way of our lessons.
Mitsuya-sensei...
Tanaka-sensei...
Tanaka-sensei...
I- I don't know any of this.
I- I don't even know which parts I don't understand.
and it would take a long time to tell you about it.
Sensei!
Middle school is part of mandatory education.
--Public schools have some good things about them. --Please! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
 --Base times height divided by two, when dividing fractions, flip them over,  --What's so bad about math?
 --Base times height divided by two, when dividing fractions, flip them over,  --What's so bad about math? Whoo!
Sana-chan, excuse me... hey...!
No time for that! Study! Study! Study!
Say, Akito-kun, let's both help Sana-chan, too!
Akito-kun, what did you just say?
even if she stays after and crams, or whatever,
Everyone, calm down! A child who quarrels is a bad child!
Smushed that mosquito!
You can't do what you can't do.
Hayama...
Shh! Don't say that too loud!
Hand over the make-out picture! Hand it over! Hand it over!!
A conspiracy is an evil plan
Make-out picture!
Hold it!
I know! Now's just the right time for Burutcha!
What is this, Tanaka-sensei?
in just three days. Testing them won't do any--
If you have to test us, at least make it a little later!
S- she's on fire...
Thank you, Andoh-sensei!
Look how pretty it came out!
That's right! Limbo!
he's there.
...for two.
Isn't there any way to get the water back in the basin?
Sagami Rei-kun, my chauffeur, manager, and former boyfriend.
My voice is doing fine!
Yo, Kurosuke! I don't see him.
Oh, how pretty!
--You know, you can give Kurosuke some water to drink --Oh, wonderful! Cute! Coquettish! Lovely!
Ah, Sana-chan, that's enough.
Why not!?
What? No one's here. I'm sleepy...
Hey...
Stay back...
Stay back!
Mami-chan, let's go to the nurse's office.
an8"Sana doesn't understand?"
--Babbit-san, I brought my friend. --Hey, it's the American...
but there's something wrong with Hayama, too. I wonder what.
Can you understand that?
That's just how scars of the heart are.
Is this his day off?
Push it! Push it!
That's okay, I'll stay here.
Sure you will. Kurosuke will be waiting for you, and all.
Come on, you were going to talk about Hayama, right? Come on, come on!
Sana-chan, thanks for coming by today. I'll see you at school tomorrow!
that doesn't mean that everything up to now is swept away.
"Sana-chan thinks!"
Happy!
 Happy, happy, happy, everyone happy, 
 chuck away the sadness and the pain, 
 becoming friends again, happy-py! 
Happy!
Mami-chan, is there a type of boy that you prefer?
It's just a wig.
Now for a model... all right, there's one!
So, which one is best, Mami-chan?
No good, huh?
Hayama, don't beat up the school building! If you don't want to dance, then say so!
Now you've done it.
you won't be able to provide enough first aid to either Mami-chan's scars,
or to Hayama-kun's scars, that way.
Er, Higashiyamato-san!
I fell!
If I go up to the second floor and swing my way around, I'll get back!
I did it! Water spilled returned with a bang!
I did it! I undid what was done!
Oh, he's off, is he?
There's a straw coming out of it so you don't drink too much, okay?
--Ah, okay, I'm coming right now! --Everyone, line up.
Hmm, it needs something else. Oh, I know!
If I put a little spiral on his tummy...!
What did you draw?
Don't drink too much water.
Hayama, you paint something, too!
Um, Kurata-san, I don't think you should be walking too far out.
But if it's diarrhea from drinking too much water, they're okay, right?
Who are you calling a quack!?
--Mami-chan, the folks at home must be worried about you. --Kurosuke...
It's Kurosuke!
Kurosuke!
Hayama...
Why?
Whether you're awake or asleep,
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
Even so, right now, when I'm around him, I'm relaxed for some reason.
And here's Tsuyoshi-kun's sister, Aono-chan, a 2nd grader.
Thanks.
Is there anything I can do? Ask me anything, Tsuyoshi-kun.
"Soul-searching for this week"
This.
If Sana-chan finds out, I bet she'll really be concerned.
Why not? After all, Tsuyoshi-kun is in the nurse's office!
That's why I'm telling you to stop.
Hisae-chan! Eri-chan, let's go see how he's doing!
Really? Well, I'll just pop on over.
Dull-witted girl...
Chicken?
Say, Tsuyoshi-kun, you're raising a chicken?
--You're the one-- --A- Akito-kun!
...who gave them that chick, right?
It's the chick from back then.
I made it last night and put it on, but he takes it off by himself right away.
But that was--
Do something about that!
Come on, Piyoko!
Say, did you see Aono's Piyoko? He's gotten big, hasn't he?
No!
or I'll be fired!
and they keep chickens.
an8"Do not wake!! --Misako"
No, everything's great!
Ah, I slept well! I feel great now!
Here on this auspicious day,
But Sana-chan, isn't this chicken a roostuh?
Shimura-san seems to be the only one in a good mood, huh?
Well, let's not dwell too much on it.
I will personally take the responsibility for telling that lie!
Yes?
Good afternoon. Is Piyoko here?
Hey, Aono!
I'll take in another 100 or 200 chickens, so bring them on over!
Sana-chan, please, come on down!
Sensei?
Huh!! Where!?
so BOY, take a look my way!
as he is caught up in it all?
is true, yes it is.
You can't ignore it either.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend.
--"I don't have any money to lend you!" --"I don't have any money to lend you!"
You know that, and yet you still stroll on back here.
You'll really never get over it, until the day you die!
Ah, that gave me a start.
What are you, a magician?
Something quite popular these days-- Gapyon, the lucky bunny.
No, it's not terrific, you empty-talking good-for-nothing!
Ho, ho, what else?
...is how lame my Uncle who gave this to me is.
--There's shua to be a better job coming alawng... --Okay!
Mama forbad me to give you any, so I'm not going to.
A- and that's Akaja Hamma! Amazing! This is too much!
I've borrowed a lot of money from a rather unsavory place...
And before that, I traveled to the lakes of the world,
...woik out there, I wonduh...
--Sure he is. I work with him --and be wearing this ridiculous costume!?
--I wonder if I can ask Zenjiro-san --Soon I'll rise up
I don't know.
--Sana-chan!! --I knew it! It's tasty woik aftuh all. It's gotta be tasty woik.
He was thrilled when he gave that doll as a present to a 6th-grade girl.
Who are you to be saying something like that?
S- Sana-chan and Akito-kun, you've been doing that...?
Still, are you sure that job is really okay?
No problem, no problem.
Even if you can trust her ex-husband,
Whether you're serious,
S- sure...
This is the secret organization's headquarters?
What do we do?
Congratulations, I say, congratulations!
That's my idol.
--I can't take this! --I can't take this!
Sana-chan is going to be sold off!?
Tonight, we offer something that you don't get to see every day
By special request, we have prepared some magnificent entertainment for you!
-- You can scoop up loaches,  -- You can scoop up loaches, 
But with today's events, we have an agreement to write that debt off.
He wasn't lying about that part. Right, Secretary?
How is this tasty!?
You're wrong! You don't understand, Mama!
He still really thinks a lot of you, Mama--
You haven't learned your lesson yet, and came back again!?
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
to always go along with the scenario.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
so BOY, take a look my way!
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Love-Love, Father Hayama's Song
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend.
Delicious roasted sweet potatoes!
Let's see, mine is on March 7th, so...
Yeah, she's kind of weak at math, so this will take a little time.
 Jingle, Christ-sama's birthday! 
Never mind that...
"A cemetery visit with the Hayama Family"
Are you saying I'm not!?
your mother, see...
so you all go on ahead.
I don't know.
I still don't know her.
Moai?
She looked a little younger than you, Dad.
She was pale, her hair was long, and she seemed pretty elegant.
That's right, I could do that, huh?
My name is Kurata Sana. Your little boy is a bit of a scamp,
 Aah, living in this world, 
Yeah, yeah, like he had an alligator stuck in his back teeth,
Girlfriend?
It sure was.
I will do it myself, and I'll be fine!
There they are!
Sana-chan?
Do you realize what you've just done?
Father Hayama! You're already thinking of marriage!?
Huh!? Dad has a girlfriend!?
She is the same Beautiful from the visit to the cemetery.
Oh, it's Beautiful! Is that one of Mother Hayama's old photo albums?
Hayama, what about you?
but he hardly ever does so now.
You finally got over being a chicken-and-egg dum-dum,
E- excuse us for just a minute!
Be back soon!
Such an odd interior...
I'm surprised at how well Sana-chan can make up such a silly story.
Now then, I've heard all these stories about Hayama-san,
so now, why don't I tell some stories of my own?
you'll reconsider and be absolutely fed up with him!
-- our Father Hayama!  -- our Father Hayama! 
-- father is a strange old man!  -- father is a strange old man! 
You're still in your third year of middle school. Marriage would be...
I was 24 when I married your mother. By no means do I think that was too soon.
Ah, Sana-chan, you're over, are you?
Then, judging from your reaction,
Shiori-san, as you know, up until just recently,
I'm sorry, Akito.
You really are idiots.
Hey, Shiori, isn't winter great?
You think so?
Ah, isn't summer great?
Oh, yeah?
The same was true for Natsumi.
Really?
Akito-kun said he wants to hear the rest out of his father's mouth,
Shut up.
What for?
He's a shocking father, our Father Hayama!
In dire straits,
to always go along with the scenario.
That rumor that I love you
I'm Babbit.
"She's Here! Mother's Mother"
From now on, I'm trying to become an exemplary writer.
Onda, I know I've been quite a nuisance up until now.
Yes! And now, I'm going right back to the office!
Kurata Shizuka?
Oh, Sana-chan, is that you?
In her first appearance!
who stopped by during his travels while compiling the History of Japan,
M- Mito-no-Goroko!?
To think that you were an acquaintance of Mito Komon!
--Don't tell me she still hasn't given up yet about that one matter. --I'm just saying, why now?
It's been so long, why don't you just have a nice mother-daughter talk, Misako-san?
After all, you are the only daughter of the Kurata family.
Please let your father have some time to relax without your mother around.
Dad! What do you mean, the buses have left!?
Coming! Hailing from Kusatsu, in Gunma Prefecture, I am Tadokoro Seiichi.
The next gentleman.
I was unaware that you were one of the Madam's business associates.
Y- yeah...
Head clerk, head clerk, head clerk-san,
Welcome!
A cute Sensei?
Abandoned child? You mean me?
Sana-chan's house is right around here,
After all, the inn must be busy during summer and winter vacations.
Besides, Mama and Grandma seem to be pretty crabby to each other.
There's no way she'd fail to come see her for four years.
Shimura, call the liquor store and fish shop!
I'll have Spaghetti Vongole, heavy on the Tabasco,
Aren't these used to measure the temperature in the room and such?
Sana-chan, do you like working on TV?
but lately, I think it has been getting a little more fun.
Mm-hmm, Grandma.
And over there is Tokyo Tower.
We have been waiting for you.
Toriyama-kun here is a big fan of Madam Sana.
I'm Sana!
Right now, the real Sana-chan is sitting right in front of me. I'm so bowled over!
Isn't that a coincidence?
now she's after Sana-chan!
Could it be that she is scheming to leave Kurata Inn to Sana now?
That's what I would probably guess.
Yay! Lucky!
This way, please. This way, please.
This week's Sana-chan.
I guess you could call him my good friend.
Good afternoon.
This boy...
I like the look in his eyes!
You're Hayama-kun, are you? Do you like hot springs?
Huh? Seems like I've heard those words before...
Sana-chan! You are my whole life!
Yes, you have, many times.
Wow, Shimura-san, that looks delicious!
Once that happens, it will be too late.
I get it. There is some truth to that.
Don't suddenly start looking at him as your rival!
I've been waiting for an answer.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
he's there.
...for two.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 30, the "Sagami, the Heartbroken Man" saga,
"Kodomo no Odocha"
That rumor that I love you
show up on their cameras without their permission,
I'm terribly sorry.
so I had to ride the train, and before I knew it, I was late!
Yow! Sensei, you sure are strict, huh?
"Kimuchi Takuya and Kurumi Asako have discovered a burning passion"!?
Asako-san has a new boyfriend!?
there's no telling what will happen! Are you seeing her regularly?
"I am Kurumi Asako's boyfriend."
"Child's Toy"!
This show has been taken over by those of us from "Child's Toy"!
Sure, he may be handsome, but that's all he is.
Are you okay, Sana-chan?
He's handsome, he's kind, and he's funny.
He has all three of the critical elements for getting girls!
Excuse us! One moment, please!
Asako-san, if you would...
Asako-chan, hurry!
She hung up on you pretty abruptly, huh?
Is that right?
You really don't have to wear that outfit.
The girl is style first, substance later.
Cut! Okay, nice job!
I can't see very well from here. Over.
Don't worry, I'm using the back of the blade.
Okay, everyone, good job! Let's keep it up tomorrow, too!
W- wedding!?
an8"It's dangerous to dance in the car"
Yes!
Er...
Wherever you are, at all times, you have to think about Sana above all else.
Right now, the two of them are enjoying a romantic dinnertime. Over.
she loves him because she's kissing him?
Y- yikes... I just remembered something weird...
And Hayama isn't the type to kiss just because he doesn't hate someone, anyhow!
What's the use?
Hello! I'm a strange young man who dances everywhere... everywhere... everywhere...
It's no use! I'm too embarrassed!
There are fools who dance, and the fools who watch them!
Sorry, Sana-chan, but would you take the train home today?
He's going to find out sometime, anyhow. As long as he is,
And here, I'm the director...
My fiancee is someone famous for being the queen of quiz shows,
Asako!
Once I become a full-fledged actress...
Let's hold our own...
...for two.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
And our usual classroom...
when the children go home,
The mysterious straight man, Babbit.
Just so you know, Babbit is not a cat.
Right, look closely.
It gets harder after this.
--What's most charming about Naozumi-kun? --Has he given you any presents?
--How long have you been going out? --Which one of you asked the other out?
Of course there isn't! I wouldn't allow there to be anything more to it!
--I've heard that rumor before, too. --rumors like this tend to get very exaggerated.
You big chicken!
What?
We're going to plow right through the press corps. Ready?
Okay!
 and be afraid of entertainment reporters? 
--Do you have any response... -- Run too much, and you're going to fall down. 
 Naozumi-kun is just a friend from work. 
Here's who I am. It's a pleasure.
Free entertainment reporter?
My children are fans, too, Sana-chan.
Well...
I can put up with just about anything,
or aftuh she stopped liking me,
and I followed her awl around Osaka on my bicycle...
through that mountain of reporters!
an8"I can tell jokes, too"
Woah! I'm late because I watched those morning anime re-runs! Rei-kun, drive me!
What's the matter, Sana-chan?
I got up early enough today, which is rare for me,
and before I realized it, it was 8:30!
Uh-oh, I don't know what to do about this...
Sorry, he's just this reporter that I know.
Let's stop centering your greetings on just the two of you.
Who's that?
Sana-chan is acting weird.
If you're scared, you should stop butting in.
Akito-kun, what did you do to Sana-chan?
Sana-chan is being incredibly weird.
That is unusual, huh?
Huh? For me?
Huh? From Rei-kun? What's this about?
For a while now.
Why would Rei-kun call me all the way out here?
It's no coincidence. Sunglasses-sewn called me here.
You're on your way to sell some scoop photos to a picture tabloid, right?
I was just seeing if you would admit to it.
A- are you trying to threaten me!?
Sorry, but I've decided I'm going to be a little more thorough.
an8"The reporter leaves"
Sana, get engaged to Hayama-kun!
Your mother died soon after giving birth to your brother, right?
I'd like to write an article about the things they have in common in that area.
Sana-chan, I just feel so creeped out. I'm afraid to go outside.
Yahoo!
That's her!
That's obvious, isn't it!?
Oh, come to think of it, he did say he had children.
--So Hayama is a dinosaur freak, huh? --Do you have any cardboard you don't need?
Okay then, Sana-chan will work hard on cooking, too!
That's okay, that's okay!
Welcome home!
Oh, very nice! Kurosaki-san,
Like there's a cactus inside them, pricking at them!
Dad, you're good at this.
Oh, show me, show me!
Watch what you're doing, Pop! It'll be uneven.
an8"We ate the Ofu-rench toast!"
Huh? You mean Tsuyoshi-kun's father?
According to the personality assessment notebook,
...panic!!
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
The mysterious white bat straight man.
...Who were divorced by Father Oki. When he snaps, he's scary.
Today, around 7 p.m.,
...there was an incident where a drunken middle-aged man is said to have suddenly started
Responding to an investigation by the Matsunami police, Suspect Oki said...
You're being strange.
Math, Social Studies...
It's okay. Me and Aono both think of Dad as being outside the family,
Hayama!
Hayama, you saw the news last night, too! That really was a surprise, huh?
Then why did you come here, huh? You really aren't being very sincere.
Mm-hmm.
...cockscomb cuts...
...he hated them.
We have different last names, and I haven't seen him once since then.
Um... um... um...
I'd better erase it, huh?
Mm-hmm, but I get the feeling that he's overdoing it-
and people say bad things about his family,
That's not somewhat similar, that's exactly similar!
Rei-kun, Sana is a girl who puts the lives of her friends ahead of work!
This is an anime, so we can do this. Don't you do it for real, now.
Tsuyoshi-kun!!
Huh? This is the police station.
Yes.
Yes.
In any event, word is that he was hitting them for no reason.
Yeah, I found some money, so I came to turn it in.
Oh, that is quite the bold lie.
You're okay, right?
Tsuyoshi-kun!
Aah, what should I do!?
Thanks, Akito-kun.
What I mean is,
Sana-chan, your hands are so soft. And they smell like soap...
Brother...
You've got some pocket change, right?
Mm-hmm. Those kids were skipping cram school, and goofing around.
That's why the old guy snapped like he did.
Like she was in a daze...
I'm going to go, in Tsuyoshi-kun's place.
I'll bet he will be pretty lonely, if nobody goes there.
It's not a sandstorm, and it's not a typhoon, and it's not a tornado...
Dad...
Hmm...
"Back against the wall."
And our usual classroom...
and for an American feeling, Texas!
The man who I declared was my boyfriend, Take-chan, a.k.a. Gojo Takeshi-san.
 I've decided to make just one, and give it to only one person. 
This has been true since last episode.
That's right!
And as for girls likely to give out chocolates...
Good morning!
It's Kurata-san.
--Discontinued!?
--Why!?
I'd like to pound his face.
Huh? Sana-chan... what a coincidence...
Naozumi-kun, you're going to get three whole truckloads from your fans, after all.
She's not here anymore.
Have you gotten "seriously ill" again, Take-san?
Say, this serious illness that Take-chan has...
I've done it again.
The set is in place, right? Scene 38!
Bang!
Director...
Oh, am I on already?
Take-chan! Don't you run away!
Uh-oh...
They're waiting for you to show up, Take-chan.
Um...
Studio crew...
Go on, eat, eat! There's as much as you want!
Someone very dear to me.
Someone I loved.
so we each complemented what the other was missing.
Or so I thought.
--I'm all out of material. --with a bit of a twist here, huh?
Attention all passengers.
Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.
Here it comes! Here it comes! Here it comes!
Ew, I haven't said that in a long time! Gross!
Ow! Just kidding!
 Thinking about it wrong is just like doing nothing! 
 Frogs and crickets are alive! 
Sorry to keep you!
Sana-chan!
--Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
Mm-mm, nothing. Never mind me, what's in your bundle?
She's right!
You've worked up the nerve, huh Hisae-chan?
I'm so happy! Say, Aya-chan, one more time.
But it makes me so happy!
"Gnileef dab a tog evi."
it's all "waah!" over here,
Listen, folks, on Valentine's Day,
"Am I Wrong For Running Away?"
My Aoki award-winning Mama. The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
They're teachuhs who are... getting it on with each othuh.
"Or so she says..."
You guys didn't clean up, so get on out of here!
What happened?
That's not good.
Ooh, this bloodlust is incredible...
What? What? What?
Oh, I can understand that! It never fails.
Am I right, Mitsuya-sensei?
Ha! You sure are old-fashioned and hardheaded!
You're so stubborn!
Didn't you hear me?
--That does it! Now I'm furious! --Kurata-san!
Somebody come forward and represent the boys!
I heard everything!
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Sensei, we won't be beat! Let's use my Norinori!
 Build a great nation, Kamakura Shogunate! 
-- Build a great nation, 
Traditional... traditional hairstyle!
You're being too loud in here like this!
and overcome this wall.
So you see...
--Boys! Boys! Boys!
Ah! Will I never be able to see Aya-chan again for the rest of my life?
"The two of them walk a thorny path"
Let's be the only ones who aren't fighting, okay?
Mm-hmm!
"Thanks for the meal!"
Everyone, let's study the spirit of Japan!
Hayama! Clean up before you go!
--Hey, boys!
your mother forgives you!
Today we're having spaghetti, huh?
Ba-bing, ba-bing, get going already!
What is this?
Zenjiro-san!
What I mean is, pretend I never said that, okay?
At this point, it comes down to the final confrontation,
This is for real. This is what you call a real fight.
Uh, in that case, why don't you both change outfits at the reception?
he's there,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Right, right.
Shorokutai, huh? Hmm...
Mayu-san, pleased to make your acquaintance.
Never mind her, what concerns me is...
Shooting on "Child's Toy" appears to have run long.
What? She's coming later than me?
Sorry I'm so terribly late!
What? What is it?
It's just... your hair...
we'd like to get started.
Sagami Rei! Very sorry I'm late!
--In that case, I would like Kamura Naozumi-san to be my co-star. --There's going to be a drama part, too?
Uh, well, I was going to get to that...
That was some nice naming. You've got a good sense for it.
He seems a little lewd.
Hey, what about you, Hayama?
Ah, mm-hmm. Right, I'll invite them!
Um, Sana-chan, will you invite Kamura Naozumi-kun, too?
What!?
What's the matter?
Good heavens, what was that producer Tsu thinking?
Sana-chan, I'm begging you!
Must be tough, huh?
as the co-star for the drama.
Is that right?
You're as cheerful as ever, huh Sana-chan?
Do we make it Sana-chan?
Great! Great! That's perfect!
What a sassy girl! Mayu-chan is on a whole other level from her!
Is that Zenjiro-san?
Oh, yes it is. It's his birthday present.
Let's ease on ahead.
You've done it, all right.
Yuck!
Oh, she's mad, she's mad.
the taping of the Shorokutai special went on,
Ah, Mayu-chan, good morning.
-her own natural self, huh?
B- but why!?
Mama, go ask them to retake everything
an8"Tobita Mayu-sama Ayanohanamarukoji Tomomi-sama"
from the beginning.
and I guess it became annoying for you, Mayu-chan.
It's poses like that one that I find most irritating.
I have a bad habit of always enjoying myself while working and everything else.
Mayu-san...
Wow, Tomomi-chan is a lot more coercive than she looks, huh?
She must have dropped it earlier when she fell down.
 Would you let me join in with you! 
-- lt takes a lot of vitamins 
-- You're posing too much, 
-- we're not children here. 
That's what you say about times like these.
Aya-chan and Tsuyoshi-kun.
The Confrontation Between Presents and Aya-chan's Love,
It's starting to get chillier. Please take care not to catch cold.
And this is Tsuyoshi-kun's younger sister, Aono-chan,
Yay! It's over! It's over! We can go home!
They're in love-love, huh? Tsuyoshi and Aya.
They're going to do their homework together, huh?
Now Aono, you're going to spoil your dinner.
Mm-hmm.
Isn't that nice, Tsuyoshi? You're popular with the girls.
We're talking about a long time ago now, right, Mom?
This isn't Aya-chan's handwriting!
N- nothing at all. I'm going to go on ahead, okay?
--Tsuyoshi-kun, let's have some fun!
and go over your answers with those around you.
Say, how do you do this? Teach me! Teach me!
Sana-chan, I can't! It'll just make trouble for me!
So that's it. I get it.
when you like someone, you like them.
Tsuyoshi-kun has a real weakness when it comes to presents, huh?
that Tsuyoshi-kun falls for any girl who gives him a present?
Really?
I'm sorry, Aya-chan.
That's dreadful.
I-I c-can't w-write!
It's Zenjiro-chan!
As it turns out...
Remembuh, my populah little Tsuyoshi-kun,
Let them keep fawling for you, I say.
Sana-chan doesn't discuss these things with me,
What do you mean, appeal?
 It's terribly troubling to love-love Tsuyoshi! 
Hey, did you hear about Tsuyoshi-kun?
That's it!
Right, Tsuyoshi-kun?
I'm sorry, Aya-chan!
--I have a package for you. --Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! A package! Yay!
together with Aya-chan!
You're late, Tsuyoshi-kun...
and I've always thought that you're really great.
Hold on there, you. You were just thinking of something bad, weren't you?
Sana-chan, Akito-kun, sorry to make you worry. We're fine now.
W- w- what should I do?
"Back against the wall."
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend, I suppose.
No, I haven't.
 Kusatsu is such a nice place, come on by at least once! 
 Flowers blossom even in the hot water! 
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
"Never forget your smile and grateful heart."
Thank you for coming. Over here.
That's my daughter for you! Well deflected.
I'm sliding! I'm sliding! Gleam!
an8"Hot water field"
Let's see... Nothing in particular right now...
Family trip!
Huh? Me?
 In business since the Edo period, even Mito Komon regularly stayed here! 
 I'm traveling with my son and daughter. This is the paradise spot of Genma. 
I've never been skiing.
Ah, how agonizing. I wish we didn't grow old.
and go into retirement.
We just need to press a little more, huh Boss?
it will be Kunisada Inn.
Excuse me.
It's not meant as a joke.
It's just little old me!
I wonduh how the watuh is. I'll just let myself in...
Oh.
Are you running away from me!?
Right now, Akito and the others are skiing,
Akito? Oh no, is he lost?
Wow, this is a supoib inn.
Welcome back. Are you unhurt?
Oh, yeah. My son has recently taken up karate.
Are you saying that you're going to inherit Kurata Inn, little lady?
Well... I won't say that I never will,
Oh, my. Well, anyone who looks at you anymore sees a fine head clerk.
Awl right, you!
Grandma!
If you sheath your swords and depart, it will be well with you.
Is it ovuh yet?
I dunno...
Mm-mm, it was lots of fun!
How was your first ski trip?
...for two.
he's there,
Let's get ready for the party!
I'm Babbit-ribbit. Hey, I'm no frog.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
The handsome and gifted child actor and trumpeter, Naozumi-kun.
Nah, I wouldn't say I'm high-spirited...
Mm-hmm, after all, this year's party is going to be...
Yeah! Yeah! Let's do that! Let's do that!
Noriko? It's me, it's me. Zenjiro.
Mm-hmm! I'm looking forward to it, you know?
By the way, Sana-chan,
Mm-hmm.
Okay, see you when we shoot that commercial, okay?
Come, if you like. But do any bullying, and you'll have to leave at once, got it?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
W- well, how about it, Akito-kun?
Not really.
Oh, this is so cute! You think Tsuyoshi-kun will like something like this?
That's more something you would like, Aya-chan.
Yeah, on Hayama's present?
Does he like motor sports?
Eh!? Declaring your feelings!?
and bungee jumping,
a kiss!
...know... her secret.
I'll just say one last thing.
Sana-chan should be calling off your middle birthday party.
That's right...
...I didn't know about it.
What's your favorite color right now?
But then, now that I think about it,
The one back then was a terrible shock,
but that was something one-sided that Hayama did on his own, after all.
Mine might be for work, but Sana-chan said she was looking forward to it.
We heard, Sana-chan.
--You called? --...turn them out like that!
Huh, Akito-?
You two make a lovely couple, just like in anime!
From the other direction comes Gangster Naozumi-kun, the same way.
R- right.
it comes...
I can't! I can't!
--Sana-chan! --She got away!
Oh, is that all?
And?
A big idiot.
"Back against the wall."
That's what you say about times like these.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
It's here! The middle birthday that Hayama and I have been waiting for!
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 38;
something will happen on Christmas Eve. What on earth could it be?
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
The handsome and gifted child actor and trumpeter, Naozumi-kun.
Good morning!!
I had to write an essay on remorse, together with Hayama?
Then, it could be interesting if you wrote about this upcoming party, huh?
Knowing Sana-chan, she's sure to be thrilled with whatever you get her.
No.
What is it you're looking for?
A Christmas present for your girlfriend?
"RRRRRRR"
--This? What about this? --It's not nice to the touch.
Sana-chan and Kamura are-!
it feels like she's someone from a faraway world, and not our friend, huh?
Once she puts out her book, she'll probably become even more famous.
Akito?
But I'll be here on the 25th.
Right! Christmas is really on the 25th, after all...
You've been strange since your first appearance.
Oh, Rei-kun, did you say you're not "ukare" merry?
Oh! It's finished!
Oh, Naozumi-kun! You're already here? You couldn't wait until the party tomorrow?
--No, I'm actually on my way to work... --Wow, thanks for coming! I've been waiting!
I really did want to come, though.
I have plans every year on Christmas Eve.
W- what's this?
You're kidding! You're available!?
Here's a self-portrait!
 Birthday and Christmas, happy-py-py-py. 
Please feel free to eat this food right up, okay?
Here's to just the two of us tonight.
Here. Your present.
T- thank you.
Open it!
Oh, I knew it! You have that dinosaur figure in your room, after all!
I did a good job guessing! Mambo, woo! Cha-cha-cha, mambo, woo!
I heard about it from Tsuyoshi-kun.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Stop taking so long to write!
As if! I'd bettuh polish my front teeth.
Yes, my name is "Andoh Polynesian Sumire!"
We wish you good cheer!
Hey! It looks like you're having fun without the main character! I'm coming, too!
Yes. From Kamura-kun.
Naozumi-kun?
After all, this is my home, and everyone is here waiting for me.
Ah, this is unusual! A stray dog!
I wonder if the reason why she cares about me
Oh? Do you need the bathroom?
No...
...tasted just like his lips.
"Back against the wall."
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
so BOY, take a look my way!

the saga of the verminous Maya-mom's attack on the Land of Kuraata,
is true, yes it is.
Good morning.
What is this!?
Could you stop fluttering around like that? You're dragging me down.
W- we all look like this now, so don't worry about it.
Hey, hold on, now! Hey!
M- Mama...
--M- my queen, what an unfortunate form you've turned into... --I got done in! I got done in! I got done in!
Even Maro-chan, the chipmunk...
That's pretty chic, Misa-moth and Maro-moth.
Y- you look lovely, Asako.
What are you doing here, Tsuyoshi-kun!? What's more, you're unaffected!
Apparently, it was around here that Mama was sprinkled with Haya-moth's scales.
That was unexpectedly easy, huh?
Grubs, are we?
My eyes are spinning round and round!
T- that's because we had on airbags.
Look at that, he's got better manners than I expected.
and not make any more copies of yourself, I'll let you out of there.
Okay, I'll be a good boy.
I'm not so sure! I'm not so sure about this!
Hi there, I'm Sana-moth.
Come down here! I'm going to spank you until you can't scatter any more scales!
Those who are put under spells by gods become immortal.
He won't get away with this!
It looks like you return to normal right away
That's what you say about times like these.

And that's her chipmunk, Maro-chan.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
Oh, Sana-chan's room has seizure papers on everything-
Which explains why the gentlemen from the tax office
Why did you trust those people so easily?
What do you want?
We would visit the art gallery and the museum,
Evicted?
A cooperative apartment!
Not at all.
You brought your Norinori machine, huh?
 Having life proves that we're alive. 
 The rain will stop, and the days will be bright. 
If you can't be quiet, I'll knock you flat!
Think a little about how you're disturbing the neighbors!
Just like that, the days went by,
Sana-chan!
But Sana-chan, your family went b-... b-...
You knew?
There's a lot to take in.
I'm so happy. This is a big help.
Even you, Gomi-kun?
An eraser, shaped like a turd?
Y- yeah.
Futons, or blankets, senbei crackers, chocolate, margarine, nail clippers,

Thanks.
However, in your present circumstances, you must have some expenses, right?
Very well.

Your concern is more than enough, Naozumi-kun.
S- sorry...
She's wearing it.
mixed with bamboo shoots, rice porridge, and leftover bento.
It's cold this morning, huh?
Yes, I understand.
They pasted these slips of paper on?
"Ooh-ooh" Didn't I look like a monkey?
But it's too bad you can't take that with you, huh?
Hayama...
Here it comes, here it comes.
Oh, Mister, you spin real good, huh?
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...
It's all crazy over there,
it's all "waah!" over here,

and you will be through.
Who are you?
After all, they could probably market Sana-chan on a larger scale, and all...
I wonder what they're talking about. They seem to be on fairly good terms.
What were you talking about!?
--Seconds! --Seconds!
Ah... don't fight. If you want, the two of you can eat my croquette.
Rei-kun has been acting strange since last night. I wonder if something happened.
tomorrow will probably be croquettes too!
with tails growing out of their behinds.
and draw in the eye like an arrow.
Sana-chan, this is our company president.
That's what I like about you.
Anyhow, Sana-chan, about what we discussed earlier...
Waah! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
Well? Sana-chan, have you changed your mind since then?
He's handsome, and nice, and has outstanding taste in sunglasses.
P- panda glasses?
Sagami-chan, I'm sorry, maybe next time.
Maybe Sana-chan would be happier joining a big outfit like Drea-Pro.
Welcome back! You must be hungry, huh? Want to have supper?
Rei-kun,
I don't have any work, so I can't go on employing you, Rei-kun.
I'm sorry, but go work for yourself somewhere else.
at this point?
No, Sana-chan! If you do that, they'll have you ovuh a barrel.
That's an octopus pot.
so that you would be lured to join their company! These guys are awful!
You used dirty tricks to divide me and Rei-kun,
Sana-chan... Sana-chan...
it's all "waah!" over here,
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Bye Bye Bye
so just keep going unlike this!
Still, Rei-kun worked so hard to find me this job,
when the children go home,
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend, I suppose.
Did you hear that, Akito-kun? That's great.
Babbit had never heard about it, either.
I love writing compositions.
Essay?
Which means, exactly one week from today?
So, how much do you have done already?
Ordinarily, I wouldn't be.
I wrote it with the intention of taking it to a different publishing house,
B- but, this will truly sell. Really, I mean like mad.

Look! Here! Here!
--Time to clean! --Hurry and get out of the trap!
"To me, those three days of outdoor school are radiant memories."
Good! Good!
Please, Sana-chan! Realize the trap you're in!
If you're that insistent about Kurata Sana's book,
She's sleeping with her eyes open. Hey, hey!
W- was that a ghost? Was that a ghost?
Ka-ching!
Cut!
Why are you working so hard on it?
Ah. Doesn't it tire you out?
Still, there's more to parents and children than blood relations.
I always want her to conduct herself fair and square.
Akito-kun?
Sana-chan... Sana-chan... Aah! Of all the times to have to go to Aomori...
Sana-chan, hang in there!
I'm barely going to make it!

No, I haven't.
It looks like Mami-chan is fairly bummed out
and zip over there at Shumacher speed!
Mm-hmm, I'm all right. I just have a touch of a cold.
You know, Sana-chan is pretty worried about you.

Of course I know that.
I don't know.
You keep quiet! You're the one responsible for Shinichi falling behind in his studies!

W- what?

What is it with everyone?
Hello, is that you, Shinichi? Why are you calling me here?

It's to prevent that kind of tragedy from happening again.

I'm sure that it isn't true love! You just haven't realized it yet!

I'll bet she wants to apologize.
Tsuyoshi-kun?
I'll tell her how I really feel... as best I can...

Sana-chan...
I've been expecting you.

Sana-chan just left on her own, heading back to Tokyo.

Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend.
The man who I declared was my boyfriend, Take-chan, a.k.a. Gojo Takeshi-san.
Mami-chan was really looking forward to reading the essay,
So it seems.
Take-chan...
What if you took off your bag?
Hayama, adios!
I got us a hotel room, so we should be okay staying at the hotel for a little while.
I guess I could do that...
Whoa! He's put out the "okay" lamp!
Surprised you?
Okay, this will be a take!
Sana-chan, Gojo-san, hurry!
Okay!
The father-daughter eyewitnessing the eyewitness,
Cut! Okay! That was a good one, Take-san.
It appears that the combination of him and Sana-chan has gone well.
Yes, yes! It's because of Sana-chan!
--R- right! --Sana-chan's appearances, too!
"Are you okay with this!?"
Whenever he comes up, she stops listening to what I say.
You set this up?
Do you have to do this every day!?
You announced that he's your boyfriend, Sana-chan.
A fellow photographer, huh?
What's so great about this old guy?
That's my Aya-chan! You've got a good eye for men!
Huh? If you are, Aya-chan, then I will, too!
Makes no difference to me.

Don't go around playing children for fools.

We can't start the barbecue without the meat! Where are you, meat!?
W- we have to eat this?
"What the hell kind of cooking is this?"
And so, the fan club was dissolved after three hours.
This tastes nasty!
We got out of that apartment safely, then? Thank goodness!
How are you?
I'm fine.
Oh, yay!

Well, you did ask me what happened while you were away, Sensei...
You have, you have... you're so good to us...

I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
The mysterious white bat straight man, Babbit.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend, I suppose.
When I thought about spending the rest of my life with you, Take-chan,
This man Gojo- he may be someone that Sana needs.
Her first name was Keiko... yes, she was named Keiko-san.
I've discovered that they do in fact have a very interesting relationship.
It's an elevator. I will listen to the rest of what you have to say downstairs.
All right, Sana-chan! Stop, already!
Ah, Sana-chan!
Oh, yeah, where's Mama?
Yes. Sakai Keiko, Sana-chan's true mother.
Hello!
Say, Akito-kun, about what you said before, what did you mean?
There, okay.
Ka-ching!
Ah! That's not so! It's okay!
Take-chan loves to surprise people, so he might really already be here!
Huh? You didn't hear what we were just talking about?
T- Take-chan!
I just wanted to find out the truth. Please answer me, yes or no.
But then...
...his name started coming up in the media...
Sensei!
Excuse the intrusion!
--What is the meaning of this? --Come on, Take-chan, hurry, hurry.
Wait just a minute!
 What would happen if I told them? 
Gojo-san, did you sleep well last night?
Hoy, we're done!
I guess I can't help that I'm so popular with the older guys.
Sana-chan, thanks for waiting for me.
Ah, Take-chan!
Yeah, really?
So... give it to me straight. How much longer?
Yeah, I tripped over my own feet. Huh?
But then, as long as I'm with you, Sana-chan,
I kind of feel like I did when I first started in theater.
All right, one more time! Yumi, run!
The nerve of him!
Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy! Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy!
with what little remaining time the two of them have together.
Take-chan?

Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
Yes, he does appear to require some rest, but for now, he seems to be all right.
We were thinking of having Take-san die off in that scene.
Well, you know, the name of the show is "Chaos Theater,"
I guess.
Maybe I should hiss at you.
S- Sensei, are you doing a thousand paper cranes, too?
Surprised you?
Hurry and get better, okay?
Boom, boom, boom, like that! And your popularity is going to skyrocket, too!
From serious roles...
...to variety.
Movies, huh?
You've got to keep working at everything.
Now then, now that I've seen my daddy's happy face, I can relax.
That is true, but with Gojo-san in the hospital...
Sana-chan,
Right now, it's more important for Gojo-san to rest easy and recover.
I went and got the scripts for Gojo-san's new drama.
an8"Resolve"
I think that's definitely the best thing to do, too.
Yes?
Stay with me forever.
Really?
Huh? That's not very funny.

I'm a real "poemer."
Of the two, I am a good reporter.
What about "Chaos Theater"? That is your breakout show, right, Gojo-san?
Yes. This drama has given me much to think about.
but she is quite an extraordinary girl.
And you're her father!
You're going to die, and leave things unfinished!
What are you doing, Snake!?
What?
T- Take-chan?
an8"The script is re-written"
--Run, Yumi! --Dad!
--Take-san, that was amazing! This drama is going to be amazing! --Thanks.
Dad!
For the first time in my life... I saw something through to the end...
No!
You can't die yet!
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
and your body will be healthy,

Take-chan, isn't this great?

So I'd like to have everyone make something to leave behind
I know you made it for me, but my appetite seems to have gotten lost.
But she can't go on like this forever.
Wow, that was a convincing fake death!
That was mean, Take-chan! I thought you were really dead!
You lied to me. You're not at my side, are you?
Where did you go this morning?
Don't dance in the car!
and anyone who might be eligible for his wife ran away from him!
H- have you seen Sana-chan!?
Sana-chan!
Hey.
Some kind of wild instinct?
Oh, there's a juice can over here.
What's up with you guys? Need a lift?
--Off, to Yatsugatake!
Anywhere else would be okay,
due to the risk of avalanche, and in certain areas-

Nobody will know who is saying what, so would you awl mind speaking the truth?

I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.
What do you mean by that!?
--Well, that settles it. Still what on oith was he thinking? --Hey, it doesn't matter. Are you done yet?
Oh, man! The problem only gets woise.
Still, the facts are facts!
Say, Akito-kun, let's both help Sana-chan, too!
Akito-kun, what did you just say?
--Yeah! Yeah!
I- is that!?
Oh! I knew it! Boy A!
Right, right.
What about it?
Hayama! Don't tell me you!
 First there comes a mountain, and then,

I thought that was going to be the death of me.
--I won't acknowledge it! I won't acknowledge it!
Those two... those two... those two's friendship...
"Eniuneg sti!" What was that?
I've had enough of this, myself.
Oh.
That's why Akito-kun started taking karate, so he wouldn't be beaten out.
That's silly, Principal.

but now, I would like to speak a little concerning it.

What is this?

Ho, you're going to tell us something?
Yes. From Kamura-kun.

No, or you'll take my feet when I'm running.
Sana-chan is really going to Junior High. Time passes by so fast.
This is it...
I'm Kurata Sana, 12 years old, I'm an actress.
I'm attending an escalator school where most kids come from its own...
But about a third of the students will be coming from other schools.
Morning, how are you, do you know who I am?
I think anyone would have answered correctly.

Tomorrow I'll still be a first year middle school student... That's right...

Yes! Sana here!
I thought you looked a lot like her, but I didn't think you were really her.
I didn't think it was really you!
Now that would be interesting!
Maybe we can even trick the teacher!
I don't want to force you to do it, but do it naturally.
Everyone's classmates, Sana-chan doesn't want you to treat her differently.
What are you two doing?!
Yeah, yeah.
Sana, I didn't say it so harshly.
Okay, we can skip over this.
Am I a coward? I think I am.
Tsuyoshi-kun, don't talk. Aya-chan, what's going on?
Isn't he that suspicious guy?

How can it have ruined your life? That's ridiculous.

We got along really well with each other.
But the rumor about my first kiss got out...

Probably shouldn't say that.

What, you're not happy?
That's not it!
It's nothing.
I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna star in a movie.

Right, it's Aki. Geez, getting on the teacher's nerves already.

Well, I guess that's where your attraction is.
These penguins are so cute.
Akito-kun, did you meet up with...

You're so worried about Hayama-kun. You're so considerate.
So many animals are gathered.

Not really.
We're not really dating...
Please tell us the truth, Naozumi-kun.
You two are dating, right?
As you requested, let's talk about the movie.
The leading role in the movie is Naozumi-kun, right?
...I think there are two leading roles.
I can only win using my acting skills.
Next, we want to ask the director Ono Mikio a few questions.
This is a private school, being held back is not unusual.

Bra?
Girls who don't wear bras are normal!
Sure, no problem, bye.

Tomomi-chan is participating in acting too.

She's not gonna stop.
Sana-chan! How is it?
It's only a little injury, I can go back to work now.
Don't think about this too much, Nao!
That's not something you can control.
You're really great.
I can't be like you.
I have a strong body!
Compared to the pain of giving birth, this is nothing.
Let's just concentrate on our work!
Sana-chan, are you ok?
Today we're visiting white-hot Mizu no Yakata movie set filming location.
If you are watching this show, please hurry and find our target.
What are you saying?
This is Naozumi-kun.
Because I was hurt, I know how it feels...
It's ok! It's ok!
It still hurts a bit, but I feel full of energy inside.
They said their emotions got out of control and made them do that.
- You told her? - Courageous!
If you're lying, I'll shave off your eyebrows!
Just forget about it already.
so resolve when to give up

Hayama, are you doing well?
If you're gonna say that, it's okay.
Are you writing a letter?
It's a person I can't see again even though I really want to.
Cut.
It isn't right.
When you first realize that you're in love.
Let's put some ice on your leg now.
People who watch will feel something.
What if I can't catch up?
There's a lot of things on my mind but everything is going well.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Ah, hello, who was that? Tsuyoshi-kun?
Kurata...
Sana-chan! Sana-chan! What's wrong, Sana-chan?
Sana-chan!
But...
You understand, right?
On the phone with Hayama?
I could have calmed down without this.
Rain, rain, how painful.
Alright! Let's call him again...
What secret supon?
The two of you leave. I'll take care of things.
but when you make me cry, what am I supposed to do?
I never knew I was such a weakling.

So... please don't cry... Please don't cry...
Ah! The Black Babbit! No! You got peed on!
Then how about this?
Rei-kun?
I see. Sana-chan is heart-broken?
Yes, she doesn't usually get depressed about little things.
Remember to shut the door or these mosquitoes will come to bite you.
I think it's coming this way!
You shouldn't have come.
Everything's such a mess!
In here?
Worry to the maximum.
But I don't have any.
If I can't change my feelings no matter what,
I should just let it go naturally.
Huh? Mountains of trash!
But Onda-san has been waiting for them for a long time, right?
Sana-chan.
Morning! Do your best today!
I'm back on track today.
You worked so hard on this!
There's my cabin.
Ah! That forest!
We were shooting over there the first day.
Are they in the middle of shooting over there?
Sorry about that!
Everyone contributed so much into this movie for me.
A lot of people even spent many months just to work on this.
Something is wrong with Sensei's helicopter.
Don't worry.
That's right. It's not a time to worry and cause everyone trouble.
I'll work, I will give it my best.
I think it's about time to go back, right, Onda?
Just this time...
There shouldn't be fire or smoke in the hallway,
Okay!
Bye Bye Bye
so resolve when to give up
it's time to get out of there!
blur2.667hito aji chigau ze DERAKKUSU
If I still like Hayama after writing all these words, I might as well let it be!
I will also learn from you, Sana-chan.
I knew it! Sana-chan hasn't recovered yet!
This is bad.
Press the signal button again.
Akito, here's your ice cream!
Don't play with your food! Don't waste it!
Just stop this, director!
How much time would we need to rescue Kurata?
Please say yes, we only need three minutes.
Sagami-san, please wait one minute, just one more minute!
Stop filming. Rebuild the house.
- Wait! - Why?
Um... Naozumi-kun...
Hurry up and put out the fire!
Hurry up, doctor!
But after dancing the mambo, my leg made a strange noise and gave out under me.
Great!
Sana-chan, Naozumi.
Hi! I heard you came to apologize.
...because of your great work...
All you guys like Naozumi-kun, right?
You like him... right?
Umm... I... already...
Everybody has something that can't come true,
but they still do their best.
After it's finished, we'll go watch it.
Bye!
This time the whole person is soft and relaxed. I'm sorry.
This week's Sana-chan!
Apples, apples, oo! Ah, apples, apples, oo...
Sensei, the manuscript...
What's this soft and mushy thing?
Visiting hours are over. Go home.
Many strange things happened...
Concentrate and write!
How can you act like this?!
Wow! It's great!
Sana-chan, be careful with your leg.
Thank for visiting me.
- Do your best. - You too.
Today I have to go to school...
I'm nervous!
Can it be like it used to be?

Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
Call it ill fortune if you like...
I mean, my insides were feeling all tight and stiff, you know?
When I thought about spending the rest of my life with you, Take-chan,
I see... So Gojo-san lived here up until thirteen years ago, then?
Her first name was Keiko... yes, she was named Keiko-san.
It wasn't my fault!
You've got lousy taste.
--If you please! --Yes, who is it?
 and always sleeps holding an Asako dolly. 
There's some dense growth in here, but no Mama.
I will contact you once I have final confirmation.
Heh heh heh, thanks to Take-chan's great style.
Starting today, there'll be a new development on location.
Say, Akito-kun, about what you said before, what did you mean?
Nothing. At the time, that's just what occurred to me.
Speaking of being bothered...
I'm sorry we're late.
Huh? What's the nice offer?
the co-starring role in a new Golden Drama in April.
Oh, that's terrific! That's a big promotion, isn't it!?
Huh? Why?
Well, I don't have anymore time today, so I'll be leaving. I'll contact you later.
He suddenly disappeared, without even saying goodbye.
I didn't know where he had gone, and thought that he had passed away.
...his name started coming up in the media...
Sensei!
That comes later! Now, head for my house, and let's go!
Take-chan lives by himself, you see, and doesn't eat decently,
Wait just a minute.
Gojo-san...
Gojo Gojo-san, do you think that Martina Hingis
Yes, Mother.
What is that thing, a lie detectuh!?
--Wow, watching Sana-chan --Zenjiro-sensei, you're too candid.
Why don't you have one done while we're at it, Take-chan?
Why would you ask such a question, Doctor?
Okay then...
Yes, Gojo Takeshi-san is indeed staying here.
Oh yeah, Sana-chan, today, I formally heard about the Golden Drama.
So... give it to me straight. How much longer?
I'm afraid, one month.
Uh... um, you mean... G- Gojo!?
Dad!
It sure doesn't, Take-chan.
For crying out loud, how long is that old guy planning on staying here?
Sensei...
Sagami!
Sana-chan, you seem as thrilled as if it were yourself, huh?
Dad!
Cut!

- Toilet, toilet, toilet, toilet! - You don't have to tell people about this.
Wanna blame someone? Have to blame the designer.
My heart is beating so fast...
...because I am...
I'm not crying because of sadness...
You owe me 800 yen for the notebooks I bought for you...
Fuka-chan.
He's in Class 1, isn't he? I'm so jealous of Fuka-chan.
Finished.
It's like seeing a rare animal...
I would, if I could.
I'd better change the color, or wear more clothes.
Give it back to Fuka.
Wait a minute!
Why did you call me that?
Anyway, you shouldn't call me by my first name...
...if it happens again, I'm going to seal your mouth with tape and throw you at the dentist!
...you have to keep quiet and clean.
So he treasures you!
Get close and he'll kiss you.
What's that supposed to mean?!
It's your own fault.
Let's exercise!
Hello, everyone. I'm Kurata Sana, from Class 8.
No problem at all!
When I heard that Akito-kun and Fuka-chan were going out...
I answered "fine with me".
End of flashback.
...but...
That's so funny.
Sana, Aya-chan, don't just laugh. You'll be late, if you don't hurry.
When Sana is upside-down like this, she can't stop...
Too late.
Right, Aya-chan?
Here, here is a wall.
Don't you all remember?
Frankly, you and Kamura-kun get along very well together, right?
I couldn't do anything about that! I was working in the mountains...

D-didn't I tell you not to call me by my given name?!
I hit that jerk.
How come no one understands what I'm feeling?
What's with that girl?
...because it's printed in magazines.
...but because of your behavior...
What are you talking about?
But because of my crazy request for him to pretend to be my boyfriend...
What? No way! You just ran all the way home to get this?
That was really fast!
I squashed two people on the road.
Young people in the labor force should be grateful for this chance to work hard!
Where? Where? Where? Where?
Just like what the rumors say...
What is it? Let's hear it.
It's okay, why don't you just tell me?
Thanks for telling me straight.
Okay.
You've turned bad.
Why? Why?
I'm home!
Welcome back!
Again? Why these type of questions again?
"Butt" rhymes with "stock". Sana is trying to say "stock" but says "butt".
Damn it, Naozumi! Connect me now!

You don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just doing this for your own good.
Besides, not everyone watched the show on TV yesterday!
Good morning, Sana!
Yeah, Naozumi-kun said you dumped him, is that true?
- Are you okay, Sana? - Are you okay? Are you okay?
Ah, they look like little carrots!
Now I can be away from everyone else...
Bye Bye Bye

That's alright...
blur2.667kyou mo ashita mo HIMAKKUSU
Naozumi-kun and I are only friends...
I said don't joke around with me!
I've always loved you!
If that's true, why didn't you tell me earlier?!
Anyway, my brain is as watery as fruit!
I wasn't talking about that.
Hey wait a sec, not done yet...
I was wondering what took you so long so I came here to check on you...
So, don't worry about it anymore, okay?
That's right, it will be true anyway, but why did I have to blurt everything out? I'm such an idiot.
Fuka!
News! News! Excellent news!
No, it's not like that.
Hey, is that really true?
Mama.
Of course!
- Mama! - Sensei!
I've always loved you!
Everything will be fine.
Yep. Just some things that needed to be discussed
You won't come to school again?
But why so suddenly...?
Is it because of what happened on TV recently...
So you don't care at all?
Then, I should do the same.
Do you... want to be my real boyfriend?
But I can't have any in an apartment...
Hi, Hayama.
Of course. It goes without saying, Hayama.
Hayama.
This schedule looks like one that a super star uses.
Sana-chan!
That's how children grow.
Get the hell out!
Wow... Sana-chan looks so beautiful...
Akito...
Just like a long time ago.
Why did you drop it? Is it that scary to be celebrating a birthday on Christmas Eve?
It would be great if we can celebrate a birthday like this one next year.

What's the matter, Sana-chan?
How does he look compared to Naozumi-kun?
Then I start thinking about it all over again.
It's no good...
...I thought I could forget everything if we don't see each other...
Akito-kun...
I called her yesterday.
Not going.
Great! Sana-chan's name came out before Naozumi-kun's.
I'll go now.
You're the only person who knows.
Yes.
Why? Because it's in English! English!
This letter is from...
What's "ecnetnes desrever gnitseretni"?
Must be candid camera.
Look into my eyes... does it look like I'm lying?
We had the best results possible...
Welcome...
This is Shimura-san.
Who else is here?
You don't want to see them?
Mother...
Naozumi-kun? What is it?
Sana-chan...
This is unbelievable, I'm going to say goodbye to Sana-chan today!
Because there's been a change of plans, Kodocha is gonna be changed!
...loved by middle-aged women... maybe this is my luck.
My surroundings are changing quickly...

I'm about to faint.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm the housekeeper, Alfred Mackvakiavan.
Mr. Mackvakiavan?
Is that the Statue of Liberty?
Brooklyn! Brooklyn! Manhattan!
Oh maybe because we don't speak the same language.
Why don't we use the language of music instead.
What about Mr. Hamilton?
I guess you're supposed to feel like that when you're enjoying a party.
If he were Brad, "Brad, do you like sushi?"
One's survival in the party world is always very uncertain.
It's very luxurious.
Because in my family we have a servant and her name is Shimura-san.
What was that?
...then comes the water...
20 Kg, it should be easy to lift up.
You can't do 50 Kg, Sana-chan.
In America, the unit of measurement more frequently used is the pound not the kilogram.
Be careful, Sana-chan.
We can only assume that.
I don't know who would do this.
Maeda-san!
Next is a car in America.
Even though he looks really skinny, he's actually very healthy.
Excuse me.
We're really sorry.
You said "this room... " What were you going to say?
Mackbeagongon-san.
But the cause is still under investigation.
Before the investigation results come out, you should be patient for a while.
Then, please excuse me.
Anyway I think when Mr. Gary Hamilton comes back everything will be cleared.
I'll protect you, Sana-chan.
you can laugh it away, excuse me, I must be going.
and your body will be healthy,
so resolve when to give up

But the travel guidebook doesn't say anything about it nor what to do when one appears!
Actually, Ramsy-san... there's a matter which is very uncomfortable.
You know about it, Ramsy-san?
I'm very sorry, Madam.
Eh? Oh... I see...
I heard that finding him is even harder than finding the president himself.
But Hamilton's the one who called us over!
If we don't get to see the producer, we can't take the next step...
Sure...
All right then, I'm running late for my plane so... Bye!
That was quick. It's New York all right.
Maybe we've just looked too much into it...
What happened?
A flat tire.
Everyone... let me introduce two famous artistes who have come all the way from Japan!
- Famous? - Artiste?
I'm dancing too!
Sana-chan!
Oil...?

Ah! You're the guy with no manners from yesterday!
Actually he's not such a bad guy...
Sana-chan, sorry about that... How's your leg?
She said my dancing experience is too little and my stamina isn't enough.
It's not that...
I guess so...
If it's two people, then we could work hard together, right?
Weird happenings?
Is there anyone else who's here?
What are you talking about?
But she had legs so she couldn't be a ghost anyway.
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...

Someone has their eye on us.
"Go back to Japan!"
Is there a goddess of love now?
Why do we have to have this 'angry but can't express myself' feeling?
Eh? That face looks like it knows something.
I have no idea! But there might be a clue!
Watson.
A tooth for a tooth. Extreme situations call for extreme methods.
That's a rather cold look.
I've only been able to see pictures of you, I'm so glad to finally meet you.
Hurry and go to your new rooms.
I don't understand, Mama.
Brad! Listen, listen!
The title of this production is 'Endless Summer',
Tom by Charlie Murphy, Wendy by Sandra Foster, Jimmy by Jodie Hall.
No matter what it is for...
But Michelle-san said we're way behind the other performers.
Brad? Actually this is the stagger-dance lesson.
That's true.
Don't be mad, Brad. I know you're a good person.
One, two, one-two-three-two...
I'm sorry, Naozumi-kun. Will you be okay this afternoon?
Or else...
But with no sunglasses, that's just my trademark.
They will definitely be a sensation in this production.
Uh, he didn't say "damn well", that was just me too. He's just so full of charm.
Let's go home.
...but you can't replace a lost life...

Do you want to know the real reason you were invited to New York?
Since we've arrived here many things have happened... thrill...
It must be one of our resourceful rivals from Japan who came after us, don't you think?
No... I don't know who is interfering with us, or for what reason,
Thank you. I'm glad, Naozumi-kun.
I told you that we're staying!
Anyway, it's delightful to have that troublesome bunch out of the house.

I'm sorry, it smells good...
But I can't touch it...

Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
I am Kurata Sana, a first year middle school student.
The amazing white bat, Babbit.
The ship is leaving the harbor.
It really is Naozumi!
Your behavior is absolutely wrong!
Has Naozumi lost his way?
And he didn't bring an umbrella either.
Ah! Then I'll...
...stay and housesit.
You've become all wishy-washy after coming to New York!
He has a fever right now.
Hello? Ah, Rei-kun!
- Sicil. - Bernie!
Not used to, I'm still an actress.
I'm negotiating to be in a big Broadway show now!
To tell you the truth, I didn't have any luck before, but now everything's going to change.
This person is an actress too?
If there are any problems just tell me, don't be too polite.
I found out by accident.
So many things just happened, my mind was so confused.
Ah, so that is the case.
I see. So Naozumi-kun's mother is in New York.
Naozumi is her only support right now.
Yes?
Please do.
Ever since then, the way Mama and Papa look at me has changed.
You hit my head!
No crying!
It'll be ok.
Your mama and papa haven't said they didn't want you.
...abandoned when we were babies.
Damn it!
Um, sorry... the microwave oven is having some problems.
I'm eating now.

You can't, Naozumi, don't leave... Don't leave me all alone.
Please look at this.
Long time no see, Gary.
Your age didn't fit the category either.
You can accomplish anything.
Wait!
Didn't you just say it?
Naozumi must leave Yuko.
Isn't the person who hasn't noticed you?
And he said that he won't act in your musical.
...will you promise me that you will never go near Naozumi again?
Taxi!
It's not the time to hear it reversed.
Yuko only wants to stand on stage and be praised.
... a serious scene is the most troublesome scene.
1, 2, 1-2-3, 3.
These kind of things are unpredictable.
Ah! The one you mentioned last time?
I've decided to star in a musical.
Who's this customer who still wants to eat our store's pizza?
Okay, I will go make the worst tasting pizzas.
If it still doesn't work out, he'll still have us, right?
I am Rei-kun, I am very free. He's actually a very good manager,
Too late.
It was real.... It was real....
Even the crew is five-star?
Everyone wants to know, right?
Is that right?
Something really important woman to woman.

Her husband is the king producer, Gary Hamilton.
She's a little suspicious.
You have to resolve your own problems... that's how I'll say it.
I have something to discuss with Naozumi-kun's mother...
It's disgusting.
This is all you wanted to discuss?
The reason Gary-san invited me here...
It doesn't matter how bad the person is, he's still your birth father.
I feel that Gary is also concerned about your welfare.
...you actually meant to lie to me.
Just now, that stupid guy was wandering on the street, holding a pot.
So pathetic.
Hurry up, hurry up and answer, Sana-chan.
Hello.
What? She overheard that?!
That means that Sicil is... his younger sister!
I don't care. I'll give you my life.
I'm going to ask him to search this area.
Sicil might return here.
Get out of my way, Sagami.
Sicil is very sad.
When you have a fever, you must rest.
Six. Six. Can't stop.
Right. Get the rescue team ready. And the net?
This is the place from her memories?
No!
Sana, we'll hurry there too.
It's not Sicil.
It's there!
The zoo?
I don't know what else to do.
Don't say any more!
Sicil. Why don't you come in?
Nobody needs me.
Really?
What are you doing? Hurry up and get a powerboat over here.
Go, Michelle!
Naozumi-kun.
I'm going to return to my mother's house.

It's a big job, but we don't have to do it.
Thank you, Sana-chan.
Hey old man, are you really seriously considering that?
Then we don't have much time, do we?
Asako, I'm home!
The couple is happy!
O-Oh, don't become a strange person like him.

Please excuse me.
We've decided to go back to Japan.
Sicil?
And also...
Hmm?
Gary-san, Michelle-san, and you, Sicil, are all very important to me.
Naozumi, I...
I don't really want to say this... Brad...
So she changes tone, how slimy.
Mama has some music to talk about, so we'll go out.

Take care!
Bye-bye, Manhattan!
We've invited Director of Musicals Hamilton to this program.

This place you have to jump up and down...
Be quiet!
Yes!
Ah, this is so tiring...
Yeah, I've already thought things out between our relationship as a producer and an actor.
Immediately, I started investigations and that's how I found out about your existence.
That's rude, Gary-san. How can you say that with such confidence?
Sana...
I'll put it this way, Gary-san. Haven't you realized that Sicil might be scared?
Attention! Bow! Sit down!
Action!
Well... err... eh? Lapa?
Sicil.
Sicil, it could be too late to say this now,
But I've always been by myself...
Is that true?
I'm already feeling hungry so we'll wait till Part 2 before continuing.
Are you an idiot?
Yuko Mizukuchi's performance of "Over The River" has stopped operations.

Wait a minute! What's up with you guys?
Hey!
Wait!
But Yuko, she...
Well then, we're off!
We're as close as skin and clock now!
Absolutely no good?
Gary Hamilton invited you here not to see you dance the way the other dancers do.
Uh, we did knock though.
You hurt me so many times and the dream you keep chasing disappeared in a flash.
I'll prove it to you on stage.
Are you brave enough to come?
Too scary.
She's such a reckless woman. It makes me so mad.
Maybe you wouldn't understand this.
It's my fault! My fault!
That's not true!
Guess so.
Yeah, I did say that.

Hurry up, I'm leaving.

I wish - my body hurts!
You're about to go on stage yourself, this isn't the time to be wowed.
You dreamed about it? You must've been pretty nervous.
Eh? Naozumi-kun?

You'll never have talent.
So what if it's Broadway?
It'll be the next scene, Misako. I'm so excited.

If I mix the brain juices together everyday,
I want you to continue practicing your performance skills here on Broadway.

Then you'll be the manager of a big star, right?
You were pretty good.

Ok.
The entire New York City is looking forward to the achievements of Gary Hamilton's son.
Bye. Good night.
Good job.
Absolutely no problem.

Why would I say this? Because he is my son.
You asked me here because I was an actor.
Naozumi.
What'll I do? This is so sad.
What should I do?
Bernie, I'll never forget you.
You can't forget this kind of pain.
It's because he's even busier than the president.

If you play a note, you'll be arrested!
I should find some place warm and eat something hot.
I'll take you there.

Everyone, let's hear the music of Naozumi-kun.
Everyone who sang has been photographed by this camera.
He's the type you like, right?
Sorry, that I caused your mix-up. Please don't be mad.
If I had known beforehand, I would have said that it was Kurata Sana's fart.
He's even cuter close-up.
At that time, I really did play the trumpet.
that girl named Mayu, why did she protect me?
If Mayu-san discovers the truth, you're all dead.

When Agent Tomita was pretending to protect Naozumi-kun.
Don't look at me like that, Naozumi-kun.
There's something strange!
Of course it matters.
We think so too.
You can't step all over someone's true emotions.
...don't want to arrest you.
Shaking from side to side...
Everyone! The president wants to announce something.
Because of this, all of the people who were arrested will be set free.
Come! Come!

It's not really a thing to tell you.
I don't think that it's kindness to be nice to a person that you don't like.
I'm very relieved that Fuka-san is not seriously injured.
- Huh?! - Principal!
But that's the only thing we can agree with.
Hayama-san and Fuka-san, let's just try to forget this awful matter
So about what happened...
Hayama...
Sana-chan! A guest for you!
You've worked so hard! It makes my face bigger.
In this case, it's the nose, the nose.
it's my fault that I was turned down for my part.
that's why you couldn't say it.
I'm never going to say it again.
blur2.667odoroite anata wa damatta ne
If you walk off the road you have to go along
Love me deeper, hold me, I wanna hurt you
ouch me, I'll pin you down with this pinch
blur2.667gokazoku yonin de goippaku
I like you because you're that kind of a person.
Hayama-kun was called the devil,
Naozumi-kun...
Why? Well, I think it's because here is the classroom.
Oh I see, I see, I wasn't paying attention!
Alright! I have to be really serious, huh...
I know.
It's over! We're not going out anymore.
I heard it's really popular in catalog shopping.
You're too simple, Sana!
I feel like a worm inside a mouse ear.
You dense daughter!
So in conclusion, this year's Christmas Eve
I think it's alright. This year, Asako has to work again.
Am I bad or something? I don't understand!
Yeah.
So you're free on Christmas Eve, Akito?
I'm so glad that I borrowed the costume.
what's up with Sana-chan's scandals?
Would you like to spend the night at my house, miss?
Now let's go, miss!
Oh, I'm so full!
Oh yeah, it's today, isn't it?
What, what, what is it?
Eh?
Oh yeah, those lines just now...
a snowman, isn't it?
- I lov... - I lov...
Sana-chan, why are you guys here?
I agree!
Let's gather some courage and set this straight now
and for an American feeling, Texas!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
The old man's still got it!
Oh yeah, maybe dad made some household supplies?
Natsumi, what dad made is not a household supply.
But every Sunday, you hide that storage room where if 100 people went in it could collapsed.
That's English, so please let American Babbit explain.
It's approaching Asatsu... now it's all destroyed!
Babbit!
The destiny of Tokyo tower is like a candle in the wind.
Symbol of Tokyo, representing 12 million residents' hearts.
Oh! Angel finally appeared.
If you keep acting like this, Hayama's dad is going to die.
Sana-chan, you should come to my house to play again.
The angel is useless.
Looking at Naozumi-kun's idiotic face is pretty painful, isn't it?
They are warmhearted, but it's only oil.
Everybody lay down.
Yes.
Must be.
What, Natsumi?
Here, here, I turned into a carpet.
For breakfast, you can take it out from here yourself.
I can't go to school nor work like this!
But why is this happening?
I had the leftover curry from the day before.
Ahhh, you had it all by yourself?
Oh, somebody's here.
We're better than a skunk.
They have food for goldfish in a shopping mall.
You all want to look like this for New Year?
But why did I turn into a skunk?
But it isn't my fault.
That's why I put a spell on everybody.
You are a yellow-dog.
A yellow-dog.
It's seems like he was harder to get along with when he was human.
There's no solution. If the spell on me is not undone, I cannot undo yours.
Wasn't the old lady really mad earlier?
Because you have moles.
Forget it, Sana.
You know me?
I've been admiring you.
Really?
Huh? It's still a toilet seat.
Sensei had sushi already, it's good enough.
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
and for an American feeling, Texas!
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Happy New Year!
Onda! It's finished.
I'll work really hard and super fast.
I will be cruising on a luxurious ship...
Now let me hear yours.
We have photo shoots in Paris and Spain.
I'll wait for you forever...
Is that so?
But if you're happy with how it is then it's fine, right?
That's true.
Didn't you see the interview on TV?
It's exactly the same as it is here.
London?
You will come with me to London, right?
I hope this year will be great too.
so I thought I would help by shoveling the snow on the roof.
So now I can use this chance to study more.
Everything would be a mess.
Isn't it great if life is like that too?
What is this?
Who is asking me for help?
Yeah, there's none.
It's still very vague.
F.C is unit of photic lum.
F.C. this way. F.C. street.
Definitely.
There, Rei-kun, the FC mark.
I am Kurata Sana's Fan Club leader.
I am really sorry.
Of course, those are all only rumors.
That's because they like Sana-chan a lot.
I panicked.
Then, at the wrap up party for the show I learned the truth.
Is it a TV drama? Commercial? Film? Or is it Theatre?
Rei-kun...
Really?
Sana-chan, you should think this over more carefully!
Staff will contact you about the details.
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
blur2.667watashi ha itsudemo RIRAKKUSU
I'll give it a shot.
You're late, Sana-chan!
Sorry, I have work now so invite me some other day!
This...
This is too harsh! Sana-chan! Let's quit!
Ah, wait up!
I am the director Karesusukibara.
You, young one there.
They used to call color films this.
...the part where she understands what the math teacher said.
Oh, I see, this is easy easy.
It's embarrassing but I'm not really used it.
I wonder what kind of job it is.
Oh, Sana-chan is here.
Ok, Sana-chan. Let's do the easiest problem, Q1.
It's too weird.
Director! Today, let's stop the multiplication now. We'll go over the rest at home.
So please start from another problem!
I don't wanna see this anymore!
Sensei, sorry for coming all this way.
Well, Karesusukibara-san, let's give up for today, and start fresh tomorrow.
Sana took this job at temporary too.
Thank you.
You don't know what even the elementary scholars could solve.
It's a little job... so why don't we take the chance and go to London?
So you're only thinking about yourself.
I heard London is famous for acting.
And there are a lot of actors.
When I couldn't stand watching Hayama and Fuka together so I ran away to New York.
He looks scary if I ask something stupid.
Exactly what you said. Thank you very much.
...fifth grade math came crashing down.
or you cannot understand at all day after day.
To know if the milk in the supermarket is cheap...
If that coat in the supermarket has a bargain and got cheaper...
Fuka and Sana work hard together. Math is life.
Life is math math is life... if math...
It'll benefit you all your life if you learn math.
I found it's the first time to eat as we walking like this.
The same, 28!
Oh! I see! Easy easy!
can you tell me more of your opinions?
Wasn't Mizoguchi-san only here to review this job?
Yes, but he's actually putting passion into it. It's weird, isn't it?
the real Kurata Sana is me."
What the matter is it?
You can't see what's in front of you
And make me the only one you love
and yet you always shilly-shally,
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
My Aoki Laureate novelist Mama. The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
You're the one who killed Mother, after all!
Tsu-yo-shi-kun!
Why are you running away?
Yesterday, when I went over to his house, it was awfully strange.
You must know something about it, Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
Want some, Rei-kun?
 I swore it to the setting sun, 
-- Sana would do her best in the drama.  --You can't let a scene go on seriously
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Hello, my student, Sana-chan!
I wonder if he went to the bathroom. He could have at least said something.
It's nice to meet you.
Come to the makeup room.
I'm getting angry!
I really can't think of her as being anything else. I can't help it, can I?
I'm sorry... I...
Cut! Okay!
Like daughter, like father!
I'd probably turn into a real devil myself!
Whoops, I'm still in the middle of that interview. In any case...
Next week, on Friday night at 8 o'clock, please watch the drama on channel 108.
Sorry, Rei-kun!
he's been disappearing all of a sudden. He's acting very strange today.
Uh, did you need something with Rei-kun?
I'll do my best in this drama! So you do your best, too!
I do hope it will be contagious for Hayama's whole family.
 Come quickly, day of broadcast! 
 Everyone will be happy, happy-py! 
 You better not miss it! 
What's this, all of a sudden?
My father? He's at work today, and I don't think he will be back until late.
If you don't hurry, it's going to start!
A-chan...
Do as your mother tells you!
 Lie still, my sleepy boy... 
His father's back was so big,
The truth is, I know... but why now, after all this time...!?
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
This is lame.
"Up To Today, and As Of Tomorrow"
Mm-hmm, I'm sure that was it.
Oh! You there, goils A and B, you have some idea? Speak, speak.
K- kiss!?
so I just thought I could help you to not feel so bad...
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you.
Oh, man! He kissed her, and she's still in elementary school!
--Well, that settles it. Still what on oith was he thinking? --Hey, it doesn't matter. Are you done yet?
In fact, he even used make-out pictures to blackmail teachers with!
No time for that! Study! Study!
Yeah, well, I got hypnotized by the math, and fell asleep, so now I'm panicking.
Guys, stand by me, okay? Okay? Okay?
Mm-hmm! Thanks! That's real friendship!
Say, Akito-kun, let's both help Sana-chan, too!
Why, helping her study, of course!
--Yeah! Yeah!
Hayama, are you...
Akito-kun is at it again!
That's right.
A- actually, I need to talk to you.
It doesn't matter what it is,
not to check the students with tests!
Yes, this is ideal education! This is youth!
 Let's draw one more arrow. 
 Then we stick six beans on. 
I thought that was going to be the death of me.
Y- you don't mean... Aya-chan, don't tell me that the boy you're in love with is...
I... I...
Wow, thanks, Aya-chan!
There, there, Big Brother Z, cheer up.
That's why Akito-kun started taking karate, so he wouldn't be beaten out.
Is that so, is that so?

Hey, Sana-chan! How's the party?
Anyhow, Sana-chan, we have a present for you from all of us.
-- be filled with hopes and dreams, 
-- a merry Christmas. 
Naozumi-kun sure is a nice guy. Much, much nicer than I thought.
Boy B, you've got a one-pace lead, huh?
Easy! The night kept going on!
Ho, you're going to tell us about it?
--Unduh the coicumstances, I can look past some things. They can even be a bit olduh.
So at this point now, yeah at this point now,
Once your lips touch, you can't change your mind.

Actually, I really like you a lot.
"I'll be very glad even if there's only a small role available."
Uchiyamada, you're the one from Child's Toy?
How are you? Long time no see.
Right now, I'm at a noodle eating competition.
I'm still alive.
Let me take off the sunglasses.
What are you two talking about?
Right, everyone's saying it. And it's spreading around.
When did they tell you? Where?
And you talked about going to the temple for prayers is the New Year.
Wow, they know about going to the temple for prayer too?
- Since it's not dark yet. - Alright!

Congratulations.
We went overtime. They shut off the heat, and there's nothing to eat.
there's not one time when the budget was enough.
you were so famous, Sana-chan.
This wasn't a glamorous job.
What's it?
But it doesn't matter now.
It was a good choice to accept the job.

Who are you?
We asked him to come.

Do something! Fight back.
Bye, Bald Guy. I mean Sana-chan.
I know you guys don't think much of the Math Teacher video series.
Everyone, do you all know about the Math Teacher video series? We highly recommend it.
I've always been a fan of yours.

Good morning, everyone.
When are you going to start being absent? We can help you copy notes.
Really?
I've already decided to be absent as little as possible.
I will try.
Sorry for making you wait.
I missed all of these.
I already knew it was a cold world.
Don't cry when you hold my hand, I feel embarrassed.
Are you talking to us?
It really is Sana.
The boss of all is...
If you talk to us like this, we won't forgive you.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't fit this kind of job.
- I have had enough of this kind of living. - So what kind of living is good?
Instead of worrying here about it, why don't we go find one?
Where there is a will, there is a way.
My hand...
Yes, coach.
It's because...
You've got to have the courage to fight on.
It's all broken!
- Zenjiro-sensei! - Zenjiro-san!
This is bad!
I'm the one who is wrong.
No, it isn't.
But the proposal, can you finish it by tomorrow?
It's written like this.
It's daylight! Even though it's still early in the morning.
I failed again.
- Aya-chan! - Tsuyoshi-kun!
So, let's start working.
Kurata Sana and Zenjiro gives you the feeling of wanting to laugh.
- Alright. - Stop already.
Quick, quick, we need to run.
Run, run.
Don't find an excuse.
I will not miss my chance!
Looks like you don't know what will happen next, after you've grabbed it.
A lively proposal will create a lively actor.
It's really hard to have her play two people at once.

I've talked to him because of Sengoku-sensei and Hayama...
Ah... Yuuta is out with his friends.
Yes! I finally had the courage to call him!
Hey, Takaishi!
You broke up with Shizu-chan because you just can't forget Matsui, am I right?
There will be a lot of cute girls!
What's wrong? Why in such a bad mood so early in the morning?
To tell the truth, I don't think I was chosen...
Oh, that? Don't worry.
I mailed 117 and none of them were...
That one? It's this photo.
Let's go together, Fuka-chan!
Stop it! Stop talking, Sae-chan!
What's wrong with you, Aya-chan?
Don't worry about me, I'm not that hung up about the past.
Pretty much, but a new section is added.
So I see.

This is a friendship chocolate.
That means... I shouldn't call him either.

Hey! Is everyone having fun?
Takaishi-kun and Shizu-chan are probably here, too.
What are you doing? We had to take the bullet train just to get here!
And it's...
There seems to be an event going on near here.
Event? Could it be...
What happened to Fuka-chan?
I'm sorry, we already have other plans.
Wait!
Really, really!
- Wow! He's cool! - Aya-chan.
You're... Takaishi.
You got here just in time. Look over there.
You're too slow on the news!

That is, on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow, I...

Ah, would I be in the photo?
How about a chicken nest... will it look too exaggerated?
I have a family again.
Let's meet tomorrow. Tomorrow is the last day.
Confused people like Rei-kun.
Look, I bought these two cups in Shibuya.
but we could use it now anyways.
What?
Look...
I want to go to acting classes in London.
Ahh... ah, that was...
And afterwards, I've mentioned this to you many other times as well.
Oh, he's on the fourth floor.
Really? Thank you! I know I can rely on Asako!
Did you forget...
Idiot!
Ok, when?
Ah, sir, hello, hello, it's all thanks to your help.
The feel of this apartment will be like this...
Sagami-san, I would like this sofa to be over there.
It looks bad!
Shimura-san, please, the sofa.
Ah, I've forgotten all about it.
Ah, you know? We've been keeping it a secret.
Well then, may I ask when her flight is leaving?
Sagami-san? Please help me.
What am I doing?
If I go now, I won't be on time for the photo shoot.
Sagami-san went to buy cigarettes.
No problem, wse all know very well...
Could we please wait a little longer?
There's no special reason, I just want to leave the country to travel.
Asako, it's me!
- What is it? - Ah, that is...
At first, it was I who couldn't wait.
But you have become impatient.

It is accessible the audience has forgotten me since I didn't appear so long.
He's coming.
Coming closer and closer.
The milk has formed a bad omen.

Here's a hundred thousand yen.
You are becoming prettier and prettier.
Manager-sama, hello, hello!
That ex-husband showing signs of seriousness? There must be something fishy.
That's what my rowdy intuition tells me.
That would be bad, too...
Hurry!
He's fishy to the max.
Why should they stop hanging around? I choose to stay here.
Ahhh! My nose!
Ma... Marriage??!
But... there's nothing I can do.
So I thought I could solve it with money.
But I couldn't think of any other way.
Oh, is that right?
Maybe he's shocked because I'm suddenly going to marry.
Oh wait, excuse me.
Are you preparing the dinner?
Really, where have I...
I'm the host of the 'Champion youths' interviews.
Come out, the youths inside!
- A TV variety show interview? - Eh?!
This is a very common thing.
Is today's show over? So soon?
I don' t know what you are talking about...
But your mother is really worried about you.
Of... of course not, I've stolen someone's bike before!
When he becomes serious, there must be something big going on.
Old lady?!
Just pretend I'm an ordinary uncle.
How can you say such things at a time like this?
But that guy is a definite 'no, no'!
- What's this? - Tell us what's happening, uncle.
Makoto-kun, I'll ask you again.
Marrying a millionaire uncle.
Just use this as a chance to give up.
Miyoko-san might be coming in just a second.
I was worried about you, so I asked him if he could come with me and see you.
I thought that this time, I'd find you a good father.
But Ryosuke-san is still the same, always causing a big fuss.

No. I'm running late.
it doesn't feel like a Sunday morning at all...
Sana-chan, hold on! Okay, huddle up!
Here you go!
It won't kill him to respond to me just for once!
How uncute!
What am I saying?!
In Sana-chan's eyes, she gives out chocolates to the fans on Valentine's Day.
Mm? Um... about that...
Can't... seem... to find peace...
Of course a father will be concerned about that.
Have some tea, boss!
Oh, when I have free time? I usually go shopping.
Thanks you very much for your hard work.
Or is he really a playboy?
Should I tell? Or should I not? It's giving me a hard time.
Akito, you're home!
That's okay... but your brother...
Dad...
I've decided to think about it that way.
We're only high school students, and besides we've only started dating.
Nishikawa-kun, about tomorrow...
Goodbye.
I get it.
Excuse me.

Hey you two! What do you think you are doing with my darling? Eh?
So, everyone's here, that's great.
Whoa! This one has the girls' birth dates, blood types, and phone numbers!
How do you explain this?! Things just got worse...
Doesn't hurt to have just a few, right?
Ah, Hayama's sister...
We overdid it, didn't we?
But it seems they are going to take a while, so I decided to take a little walk.

I can't trust that!
You say that, but you're teacher?
This story is only a rumor, right?
Suzuki-sensei that kind of a thing...
Well, I will notify the principal about the rumor when he gets back.
He hates me.
And now, you can say those kind of words.
So if Sengoku-sensei pisses you off with his little remarks, come to me.
Is there any way to stop Sengoku-sensei trying to find faults in your karate?
I think you should at least go rather than sit around doing nothing.
Let the Jinbo Middle School know how cool amusing and dandy the Karate is
How to make a club?
...but my hands are full with the Swim Team and the Astronomy Club...
So I have to gather 5 people?
Ok! We have to gather the members!
Mama, Onda-san and Shimura-san aren't students from Jinbo Middle School, and...
That's impossible, Akito-kun.

Yeah, in the hallway in front of the bulletin board.
Nakao-kun, any experience with karate?
just stand it before we have our league's formal classroom.
Well... excuse us a minute, Sana.
I can't think of it that way.
If you don't care and make little wrong now,
I'm not used to the formal and serious spectacle.

so I thought it was kinda dangerous. Yesterday morning...

Compared to some weak manager who was looking for a girl,
Well, well, stop it.

What? You're in my class?
Thanks, Kurata.
What're you talking about? It's expected as a nichoku's job.

Is it ok? I'm hungry!
Hayama!
Me and my husband have a small transportation company
His health is not so strong. So he made up a goal that he would never be absent.
- Did you just say Karate? - Eh? Yeah...
This karate club is something that Hayama made.
This Hayama...
So have you thought it over?
If I disappear, will somebody worry about me?
Don't mind me.
He came to the Karate club on his own will and trained hard.
It was normal training.
Nakao-kun tried his best but it was too much for him.
- Mrs. Nakao, please call the police. - Yes.
Love me deeper, hold me, I wanna hurt you
Because I wanna try crying with you
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!

I couldn't see! What does it say?!
What is Sengoku doing? Let's see.
But if I'm not a Babbit then I can't let everyone see what it says.
Although it will hurt your heart, the case is very bad.
Ah... my mother is diagnosed with an incurable disease, so I have to nurse...
But I'm saying that you have no meaning in life.
Kurata!
It's no use, we can't get in further.
Hayama-kun...
I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Nakao.
What now?
I told you that I can't turn my head!
- Eh, we're starting class? - Yes, we are.
You don't understand.
not anything like me.
He's the king of uncoolness, really he is stupid.
And because of that, I run away from my school life.
Where did brother go?
I won't say that anymore so...
Hayama, it's bad, Nakao seems lost sense,
and if we keep it, we will become mummies.
That's ridiculous...

Nakao! Nakao!
Ok...
I see.
You don't have to apologize.
I see.
never thought much about people like Nakao-kun.
I'm sick of life, everything is so annoying.
- Right, Hayama? - Yes.
Sana's not here yet.
Sengoku-sensei's not here either.
Yes. So do self-study until he comes back.
I'm dead but, no. Why did I die?
When I got back to normal and I realized I was alive, I was really happy.
Me too, I'm just like you.
I wanted a proof that I'm alive and I started karate.
Come here for a minute.
Fuka-chan.
In the conference room, the teachers are talking about Nakao-kun right now.
You guys! Wait for me until I come back!
Fuka-chan!
At this rate...
We do not know that this incident is directly involving Hayama,
That letter was shoved in between a book of Sengoku-sensei.
Why didn't you get rid of this letter, Sensei?
Matsui-san, please let me see that letter.
That letter didn't say anything about places. How would I save him?
And so Sengoku-sensei resigned before spring and decided to leave the school.
Let's meet again, Sengoku-sensei.
Hayama!
The snow melted fast.
See ya.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!

Because today I'm starting my first year of junior high!
Do you want to be late on the first day of school?!
Your answer is correct! Congratulations!
That's why I'm here. Do you get it?
But I really don't know what to ask, please tell me.
A song...
an8Aya-chan, don't forget about me...
Gomi-kun, what's wrong?
But it's really amusing...
Hey, what class are you in?
This is the suspicious kid Babbit took a picture of.
But you're this kind of young lady who always says 'oh really? '
This is a graceful young lady.
Really? Me too.
I thought you looked a lot like her, but I didn't think you were really her.
I heard people walking around Tokyo would see celebrities, it's really true!
Didn't you know?
Not only faces and bodies look alike, all my old classmates of Osaka said that.
It's right there! Right there.
Excuse me, please find the differences between the two. I'll give you 15 seconds.
I don't want to force you to do it, but do it naturally.
This girl cares a lot, she's so great.
Yeah, great! You tell them, Fuka!
Sorry.
What is the importance of the first day?
Mysterious kid?
I think it's because of his moves that the opponent is angrier.
So that's how he feels when he looks at her.
- His nose is bleeding so much! - His eyebrows are so thick!
Getting a nosebleed from looking at a girl who doesn't wear a bra?
I'm now in a really complicated mood.
What?
...and he told me he wanted me to die.
What's your name again?
That's not it!
- Good nap. - Hayama.
No, no, you can call him Peggy or Aa-chan.
I think you're the only one who calls him that.

Hayama Akito, a passionate lone wolf, has always been my friend.
Akito! Are you really Hayama Akito?!
Because of you, my life became really screwed up!!
I've always wanted to slap you.
I remember now.
Like this! Do you understand?
Step aside.
Every time I see his face I get so mad.
I forgot all about it when I moved to Osaka.
- People talk about that there, right? - Yeah...
I remember when I was talking about it with my friends...
But the rumor about my first kiss got out...
...and who knew Takaishi-kun would move to another city!
That's terrible.
To have had the first kiss already at this age.
But I'm pure!
It's so sad! I feel so bad for you!
But don't worry...
In these 3 years, I will get my revenge.
Akito-kun!
A really long time ago.
This great thing happened and you're not happy?
If you need a ghost from hell to come out, just ask me!
That's right, everybody loves to look at strong muscles!
This only happens once in a while! I can do it every half a year!
Sana-chan is really...
And this is my picture!
Akito-kun!
Anyway, we're very sorry!
I was trying so hard... I can't take it anymore!
Yeah! Gymnastics!
You remember that!
I called him.
But he already has another girl that he likes.
It's too late.
I'm sorry, I've said too much, I'm sorry.
He said he liked me.
Eh? What for?
I'm sorry I'm late!
Hey, Sana-chan! Long time no see!
Growing up is natural for most humans!
He's different from kindergarten. Also, we weren't in the same...
Yeah?
I don't know what's going on but this is scary.
But when he was in elementary school, girls did hate him as if he was a hairy caterpillar!
Sana was Hayama being scary! Gives you goose bumps!
What...
She's the one who approached me without knowing me. It's her own fault.
Hmm... you have a point.
If I'm nice to someone I don't like, I don't feel that's truly being nice.
That Hayama. He makes a lot of sense.

I want to wrap some salmon, fish eggs, plum and dried fish...
And lettuce and spaghetti...
Interesting means having a good impression of the other person.
But Fuka grew up in Osaka where comedy originated.
I got it!
So it's like that.
Going on a trip, trip...
Getting carsick-that's rare.
Oh yeah, tell Sana-chan to come over.
Akito-kun...
My wonderful plan will go down the drain!
None here? How come?
After getting to junior high, their relationship has gotten more serious.
A monkey riding a deer! That's really rare and really weird!
Having monkeys hanging on you is even weirder.
Ono Mikio is very famous, isn't he?
Fine.
Sana-chan?
I've had enough of you two getting so lovey lovely.
Yeah, that would be scary.
I hope there aren't.
Akito-kun, did you get to talk with Sana-chan?
I heard Sana-chan has a press conference tomorrow.
Did you know about that?
So...?
right?
I want to eat lunch too.
No...
I have to get to work... Roar!
Oh, it's the bushy eye-browed, bloody nose classmate!
Blood squirting everywhere...
Hayama's feelings?
That's right, his feelings for Sana-chan... he likes you.
Sorry... Tsuyoshi-kun, maybe I should tell you the truth...
Didn't I already say that I didn't know?
But... I can't tell the difference between friendship and love...
Right?
Come over for a sec...
Yeah...
Are you sure you can just spend the day before relaxing?
This... I didn't hear about it.
That's great...
I knew it...
You only want to know Hayama's motives!
According to the director, Kamura-kun is the main character.

It can't be that Sana-chan's just going to leave like this?
I already told the school.
After the affair between her and her manager... she turred to love idiot.
You're good-for-nothing!
Akito-kun, are you running away?
Ah! Why is there someone hanging around right here?
show yourself!
Yeah, I'm leaving next week.
Yours looks good, what are you having?
What?
Aya-chan, you won't forget about me, right?
Akito-kun, where are you going?
What's the matter with that guy? He's really strange...
Hayama, you'd feel better if you'd just say what's on your mind.
Kurata Sana-sama, please meet me in the back yard after school.
What's this?
Give up? Did you say give up?
I guess I don't have any another excuse...
...I'll just have to do it this way!
Who are you, old man?
Confused Zenjiro-san, I can use this as a guard against you!
- Sana-chan, give it back! - No way...
I'm ok, thank you.
Alright, let's go!
I'll tell you when you get back.

I wasn't joking!
Yeah, Sana-chan's expressions were really good!
You looked relaxed.
...and, working together with Kurata Sana-chan, there must have been a lot of talk?
"Butt" rhymes with "stock". Sana is trying to say "stock" but says "butt".
No, don't say anything, Naozumi-kun! If you say this, it'll affect your "butt"!
Sana-chan already has someone she likes.
But... I can give you a little hint.
...at work we're very good partners.
Do you know what "uoy evol i" means?

Of course I mind.
Anyway, I think of this as just a little joke... you can forgive me, right?
At least... he liked you before we left for the location shoot.
I think everyone knows but you!
She won't ever speak to you again.
If you don't go to work, you've gotta go to school!
That's right... you're right.
A failure at jumping 5 levels!
And who was it that saw you off when you went on the location shoot?
Sana-chan, here comes the ball!
Ah, they look like little carrots!
What's wrong? You don't feel well?
Someone is sleeping on the bed next to yours, so be quiet while you're here.
No need! Thanks!
Oh my god! That was close!

Hayama... Akito.
...because you're the one I like.
That thing that you always take out.
What?
Truly abnormal. Different, strange.
Now you're in love with Fuka, right?
Hayama already has Fuka, I should never have said anything... about the truth...
Fuka!
Even if I don't mind, Akito...
Try again, and say it in order!
Does anyone remember? DrePro stands for Dream Productions.
The group hated Sana-chan,
But they weren't great men!
Hey, Rei-kun... let's accept all of them.
Now that it's settled. Better make phone calls right away!
If I totally focus my mind on it, perhaps it'll help me forget.
Yep. Just some things that needed to be discussed
You won't come to school again?
Is that true?
Hmm... Naozumi-kun looks good in this outfit.
Did you mean the show?
Hayama!
You're smiling! That's good!
Really, you're in the past.
That's right, in the past.
Hayama...
But I...
Especially that movie, the critics say it's very good.
Ah... I've got it. It's called Mimizu Earthworm Palace.
What's wrong, Zenjiro sensei?
That means, we're still friends!
U-kih-so-ro-y
Ah... This week's Sana-chan!
Not at all.
Get the hell out!
Come on, Akito-kun, you can't act like you did today again.
You're the one who was dozing off.
Don't worry about the things in the past, okay?
Somehow she feels so distant...
Stop talking about her!
Just now, Akito-kun's glare looked frightening...
When is your birthday?
Mine? My birthday is December 24th, on Christmas Eve.

It doesn't matter.
...I really don't want to remember what happened...
...that, of course... I have to show up for the premiere even if the movie isn't using any ads.
...I heard there's someone you like in school.
Who's he?! Is he in your class?!
"Mizu no Yakata" is a very romantic movie.
What are you doing?
Why did he avoid the topic?
Wonder what she's been doing recently?
I called her yesterday.
Sana-chan's movie "Mizu no Yakata" is premiering tomorrow.
You're brothers... Aren't you two here to kill me?
Do you want to go watch Sana's movie tomorrow?
Great! Sana-chan's name came out before Naozumi-kun's.
Cute...
Yes.
What I get so far is that it's asking Naozumi to perform...
Why?
Really?
Talandalu is in Japan to shoot another commercial.
Must be candid camera.
Congratulations again!
With all of Kurata Sana-chan and Kamura Naozumi-kun's hard work...
Like Tsuyoshi-kun and Aya-chan.
I'm still thinking about him...
I was in New York last time for a commercial shoot.
It's a great place.
It's like I switched a new battery in my body...
Let's run away!
Kodocha...
Let's run away, Sana-chan.
I can't believe it myself.
Mr. Hamilton is a great Broadway producer.
I don't know any details about this...

Nao, wake up.
Welcome to America, are you visiting?
Right now we're over here right?
They're supposed to be somewhere to pick us up.
If a girl goes out at night alone in New York, there's definitely going to be danger.
Ok!
Please come this way.
What about Mr. Hamilton?
I guess you're supposed to feel like that when you're enjoying a party.
What was that now?
Of course I never went to Japan or any other foreign country.
Ahh! Hayama-kun!
Actually you don't have to tell us where the kitchen is.
Even at the party we're all rivals.
One's survival in the party world is always very uncertain.
Even if you beat your partner.
You have to try to find a way to protect your own status.
Kurata is 13, right?
Starting from here only the servants are allowed to enter.
Um what about Mr. Hamilton...
20 Kg, it should be easy to lift up.
What?
Let me explain to you.
In America, the unit of measurement more frequently used is the pound not the kilogram.
Maybe it's the time difference.
Be careful, Sana-chan.
an8Can Babbit be in the picture too?
That's dangerous!
Are we really being targeted?
Eating big spoonfuls of Cornflake Paste really adds a lot of American Flavor to food, Sana-chan.
If Maeda-san didn't eat it, it would have been Sana-chan!
Ramsy-san.
Then, please excuse me.
After coming here, I've noticed too many strange things happening.
Anyway I think when Mr. Gary Hamilton comes back everything will be cleared.

That's true, but it's still a relief anyway.
Naozumi-kun, although we can't seem to relax, let's work hard together.

That's true.

Brad? What are you here for?
You better be careful... you two have been targeted.
Kurata Sana, what's your motive...
Hey, Brad...
We'd also like to see the audience enjoy watching it...
If I should see them?
See ya...
Is it over already?
She said my dancing experience is too little and my stamina isn't enough.
Weird happenings?
If it has anything to do with work, Michelle can get very hysterical.
Anyway, her pride is really high...
It's happening again...
I keep having the feeling that we're being spied upon...

Mr. Hamilton says he'll be back next week, so do your best! Sana-chan, Naozumi-kun!

The dance classes consisted of running laps.

It's hard to believe that they could have snuck into Hamilton-san's mansion,
I told you before that Sicil didn't do anything wrong!
Alright, I'll do it.
Ease up a little, Naozumi-kun. Relax, relax!
Why did he leave? Why?
The lessons, right?
Whatever happens...
Bye then, I'm going to go look for an apartment.
Ah, Rei-kun, are those apartment listings?
I would like a nice expensive place.
Please tell me! What's the real reason?
Wait!
We will do our best!
"They don't need to see us."
"Let's help them with our powers!"
It's a nice place, the furniture is fine, there's a doorman...

Oh, you're right. There are quite a few. That's something to think about.

Oh yeah? Not like you usually do, in your boyfriend's car?
Well, shua. If you get too close to me,
Good teeth are the lifeblood of a perform-uh!
You're dead serious, huh?
I don't know where to reach you.
An actress' face is her life!
Hayama! It's so rare to see you come to an event like this.
It's nothing.
What's with you? You're so gloomy, Tsuyoshi-kun!
No you don't, Tsuyoshi-kun! When you're depressed, you've got to smile!
--See? Smile, smile! That's the way! --Huh? Is that right, Aya-chan?
Oh yeah? I hadn't heard. Who is it?
No way, Sana-chan!
Of course I have.
Just an the cheek, though.

We'll talk about the details later.
You two know why. You're the ones who are embarrassed, aren't you?
Who can it be?
Naozumi...

My only reason to live was to meet you once again.
Could it be that she's Naozumi-kun's...
Ah, Naozumi-kun's back.
Hey, you guys are Japanese, aren't you?
Yes, yes, that's right.

The entire New York City is looking forward to the achievements of Gary Hamilton's son.
No?
Swallow the rice ball.
However, it's going to become busier.
Yo.
It really suits you.
the one who can be termed my personal angel.
As an actor, I want to thank Hamilton-san for giving me this chance to perform in this show.
However, to me you are just Broadway's king producer, Gary Hamilton.
Naozumi.
no matter how far away we are,
Oy, hurry up.
In order to survive in this sea of lights, we've undergone many things.
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!

They actually passed a weird law prohibiting songs.
Playing instruments is against the law too.
Rabbit-suit guy is here too. He's just like normal and has a big head.
It's too weird. What kind of logic is this?
They're basically challenging me to a fight.
Oh, yeah.
Sing! Sing! Everyone sing together!
They're still trying to prevent people from singing in this day and age.
Excuse me! According to the rule book,
Ah, I'm Ayano Hanamaru Koji Tomomi.
Sana-chan said something she shouldn't have.
Who is in charge here?
I'm telling you, don't play. No.
Tsuyoshi-kun, do you want to sing together?
I've captured everyone who's sung.
Wait a minute!
He's not breaking the law.
Where could Tomomi have been at the time?
What weird powers does she have?
That's right! Even though it's against the law, strange laws are hard for people to obey.
If Mayu-san discovers the truth, you're all dead.
Silly, what am I saying? That's impossible.
The whirlpool of happiness.
You're here too, Mayu-san.
Just like this, everyone's happily singing.
That's right... by using Naozumi.
Good job, Tomita.
Mayu-chan.
See! Everyone who saw it thinks so too.
You can't step all over someone's true emotions.
It really was the sound of a fart.
It was the sound of Tsuyoshi-kun's fart.
Okay?
I'm sorry.
I also think that the song prohibition law is very strange.
The glove hat really suits me.
Mr. President, please tell us the current state of the song prohibition law.
It's been repealed! All of the strange laws have been repealed.
Just like that the summer is over.
Akito, do you like to eat sushi?!
Love you, love you love you, but now.
The port. Parting. Be careful of waves.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
And this is the problem child Hayama Akito,
who is causing trouble yet again!
What do you mean by that!?
R- Rei-kun told me to reserve my first kiss for him,
Is that right?
Really?
There are observation lounges on both the north and south sides...
She stepped on Onda.
But to have him, of all people, be the one to rob me of my first kiss...
 God and Buddha, help me, help me, help me please! 
 I really did it out of compassion, 
...the Hayama guard!
A-ha! So, you're here, Hayama!
You really are an idiot, aren't you?
And who the Deutsch is the one who kissed this idiot?
Are you okay?
Oh, it's the pimp.
That's all? Sensei, you don't mean that, right?
--Give the boy a piece. --C- cake? Eh?
Where does that chipmunk poop?
Maro-chan, you see...
No, it's not covered with poop.
as though I was "bitten by the leopard," and forget about it.
Just don't do it again.
No sooner do you say that than you get angry again.
--There must be some sup-uh reason behind wearing that mask. --then that means the secret is out.
and were avoiding me.
Is that right?
What is it you don't understand about Hayama-kun?
No, I don't.
You mean "hankoki" rebellious age?
Yes, yes, after you dumped me, I flunked out of college.
And how was I supposed to believe you,
when you told me out of the blue that you wanted to be an actress?
Rei...
I can't think about you at all right now.
That's what you say about times like these.
I've been waiting for an answer.
...panic!!
q2fscx95and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
Let's look at the pictures again.
You were a weirdo back then, Nao-pyang.
I can't believe we went to New York together, and had that disgusting food for so long.
...together.
Here's Hayama!
Aki, so have you kissed anyone before?
Back then I had a life plan!
That poor girl is crying!
Never, never.
My heart is on fire!
I'm putting a lot of energy into this work.
I have something to tell you.
Ok, I got it.
Ah... Excuse me.
I'm looking for my brother.
What, what do you want, Naozumi-kun?
Really... enough...
Me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Naozumi-kun.
When you make me cry,
parte b
Look up to...
It seems...
...you all trusted the press and Ishida-kun instead, didn't you?
But back then we had to believe it...
Sana-chan...
I'm sorry.
I finally pulled through.
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,

This is not going to work, which moron asked him to do it?
Damn, you're so...
I think it's tune, and...
Good morning.
We can just memorize all that before the third period.
Yeah... I feel sleepy.
What... it's so dirty.
It looks like they're having a lot of fun.
It's because of Fuka-chan's influence.
If you heard me then put away your texbook.
That looks like a scary movie.
What Sengoku-sensei just said is making people uncomfortable.
Please stop adding to my name.
Then... what should I call you?
Is Fuka-chan all right?
Hey, Hayama, are you ditching class?
What was that...
Wait up, Akito.
What is it?
I'm sorry, I won't ask any more questions.
What have you two been doing all this time?
parte b
Teen Net?
Why do you want our pictures?
If we take your pictures...
Since it's you guys, I'm sure you can.
One more.
- It can't be... - Films are very expensive.
It didn't come out.
Don't run in hallway!
Fuka-chan looks so happy.
I don't have any pleasant memories of this place.
Sana-chan, look over here.
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
and yet you always shilly-shally,

My manager and driver, Rei-kun.
I'm Sengoku from Jinbo Junior High Grade 1 class 1.
We finally have the proof,
What exactly happened in New York?
It's better this way.
Why are you turning your back to us?
Later.
Fuka.
Sengoku-sensei is worried about you too.
But, if you... and... Hayama-kun remain friends...
But was his violent past true?
why didn't you do something useful?
Like studying... sports...
No matter what happened,
It's actually nothing.
Sengoku?
He called my mom to school, he said some bad things about you.
If he has something to say to us,
This is rare, it was good thing I called you.
What?
Sometimes it makes me blush.
Don't play with fire.
Yell on top of a mountain.
I understand, and goodbye.
Hurry back, Sana.
After Sana came back to Japan,
going shopping, or going out, instead of going straight home is bad.
That's not true, he cares a lot about me.
He hasn't hit me in a long time, I was careless.
Sana...
OK, excuse me!
But, I haven't seen Sana in a long time.
Watering is a lot of trouble.
Maro-chan is excited too.
Really?
That's because I've known her since elementary school.
- I'm tired. - We can't beat Sana-chan.
And a lot has happened there.
- Naozumi-kun is simple too. - What are you talking about?
At that time, Sana-chan stayed with me all the time. She laughed with me...
Sana-chan is very important to me.
- Look, this is me and Aya-chan. - It's really you.
Isn't it great?
You two are perfect...
a wonderful, invincible Relax.

Away run to is to run away.
Right now we are still very close.
Hayama Akito, we are very good friends, or at least I think we are.
- See you, bye bye! - Good night.
Right?
I'm not really happy now!
It's about time you have this sort of emotion then.
You're saying...
I really want to go.
Then we'll go together.
Why is he smirking?
Take a look at this!
Sana-chan!
Because this is shake shake dance!
Naozumi.
Yeah... I was so lonely and upset...
It didn't hurt!
- See you later! - See you!
Another weird person...
I am your new manager... Ozaki Riho!
Ah! You're still cute when you're scared!
- What is she called? - I am Kurata Sana!
Um...
Wah! Sana-chan! You are a great person!
Listen to me...
If you are going to lie then break up with him now!
We better hurry and go, it's almost noon.
- It's not like that. - It is like that.
What's that? It's not like you when you're that formal.
Ah, right! I will go get something to drink.
I'll get it.
But I really don't need it.
And I don't want them to misunderstand you.
It's him trying to pick on me.
Your class teacher is talking to you, at least you should respond.
Junior high students really talk about love and relationships?
Akito-kun!
Well...
I am not going to see Akito for a while.
Can it be... Takaishi-kun?
Even though I like the serious Naozumi...
- Please praise me a little. - Wonderful.
I'm so happy! Naozumi praises me!
Riho works very hard on that.
Listen to me, Naozumi.
Think about it.
Thank you everybody!
Kyaa! Naozumi is so gorgeous!
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
blur2yoyuu SHAKUSHAKUPPE itsumo
blur2watashi ha itsudemo RIRAKKUSU
I have something to say today.
Naozumi-kun says it well. I'm liking you even more!
Please listen to Babbit's English Version of this song.
My mind was very confused.
So please, don't put those words I said into your heart.
Sorry, sorry, Fuka-chan.
Tsuyoshi-kun.
Good morning.
Thank you.
- He's coming. - I'm sorry.
Ever since Sana-chan returned, you have been acting strange.
Oh, it's really Sana-chan.
Damn...
She's only an arrogant girl.
Fuka...
One and two and one and two and One!
...look to the right, look in front, look to the left...
One and two, and one and two and Four...
For those who don't know karate, don't try this at home...
One, and Two, and One, and Two, Nine...
Cause everything tastes bad
- Your competitor is also very serious. - Competitor?
How are you? Thank you for all you've done for us.
"So what are you planning to do?"
Ready... Action.
It looks like fun.
What is it, Sana-chan? Did you forget your line?
You just don't understand me!
What should I do?
Sorry.
We can say octopus head! Or ghost!
Too bad.
Sorry to make you wait so long.
Akito.
Akito-kun?
You were startled, and didn't say a word
You can't see what's in front of you
Love me deeper, hold me, I wanna hurt you
and yet you always shilly-shally,
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
My name is Kurata Sana, first year middle school student!
Manager and driver, Rei-kun.
Anyway, don't come see Fuka any more, get it?
and so fragile.
Fuka, are you okay?
Don't you two need to take care of some hospitalization procedures?
Sana, what about you? Are you alright?
Yeah.
Hayama always gets blamed.
Akito... what's he doing now?
You're trying to hide it, can it be a love letter?
So tense...
Standby, ready, start!
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't go.
That's true.
That's right, shadows.
Calm down, Rei-kun.
How to do, Rei-kun?
Bye.
A... Akito-kun!
Akito-kun...
Why?
We can't give you an advancement test.
I went to see Matsui-san today.
Well, all celebrities love to have white teeth!
Sana is still... with Akito?
It's me.
Akito?
I've come to visit.
Can't do anything about you.
That's why you came through the window.
...break up.
ouch me, I'll pin you down with this pinch
Because I wanna try crying with you

Naozumi-kun, who was with me in New York honing our acting skills.
Hayama Akito, my friend who's been with me through thick and thin.
He's now dating Fuka.
Let's...
Anyway, you need to get well quickly.
...and cannot be replaced.
...dishonor me!
But Sensei! Doesn't it make you mad?
Kurata residence.
What the hell are you thinking, Kurata Sana?!
It's the 12th one today.
Yes, she really did.
What are you saying?
We're off, Sensei.
White dolphin!
Now I won't look funny.
You should at least warn me.
No, I'm okay.
So you say...
I guess that may create problems for other people.
Did you ask her not to defend herself?
That's why I'm asking.
I'm sorry, Sana-chan, I...
It's okay, Rei-kun.
There are lines... you just can't say.
White dolphin!
You got rid of me to meet that boy.
You and dad have misunderstood.
Why don't you believe me?
So go home, mom.
Let me deal with this, please.
- I feel depressed. - White dolphin!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hayama, she's seen through you.
She still likes you.
Don't come and see me anymore.
Huh, what? What are you doing?
Why are you calling me Sana-chan?
What? It was hard for me to come up with such a good name!
Hey, isn't that Sana-chan?
Maybe they just look alike.
Hey, Sagami.
Oh, hello.
Bye then. Don't tell anyone!

Aoki Award winning Mama and squirrel Maro-chan.
Naozumi... um...
The reason why Sana-chan couldn't say devil...
How could they print such things when it's not true!
That is... the last commercial she was scheduled for was canceled.
Eh, really?
Not this either!
Well, I guess it's all good for other child idols.
Tell me these kind of things earlier!
Hmm, Science, English and Music. I wonder what we're doing in music.
I see.
Prepare 10 Zabutons!
- See you all later! - Ah, Aya-chan!
Huuuh... what do you mean?
These days the school's image is getting worse.
Oh, then show it in your attitude.
Wow, how did you know Fuka?
Sana-chan, this is the same exact thing like in the text book.
I can spark English? Spark?
That's totally wrong!
I can speak English very well!
Well, who cares, that's Sana-chan.
Today's the day Fuka-chan can take off her bandage. Oh, I just read that.
Yes, thank you.
Hayama-kun and Fuka will never go out again.
Akito-kun saved Fuka-chan from a bunch of gangsters.
But that's the past. Now he's really a nice guy.
Yes, I'll be there in a second.
he didn't say one word about that...
Yes?
She's alright.
Sana?
Thanks a lot.
It's not really a thing to tell you.
"He's the kind of person who would take it onto himself."
Do you remember saying that to me before?
I like you because you're that kind of a person.
Everyone, long time no see! I'm the principal.
and please concentrate on your studies.
Akito.
I think she's really having a hard time in school.
I heard that he was called a 'devil'.
Hayama-kun was called a 'devil',
I'm never going to say it again.

Do you remember saying that before?
When I heard that I really understood your feelings.
Why? Well, I think it's because here is the classroom.
Sana-chan was involved in scandal.
I can't believe you really don't get it!
No, it's water in the ear.
So in conclusion, this year's Christmas Eve
is a home party?
You have to look that hard to find a textbook?
What's that?
I see.
Hayama-kun, the real reason Sana-chan wasn't in the drama, do you know?
Congratulations.
Merry Christmas!
So this is the singing and dancing reindeer set.
the one Sana-chan was supposed to be in!
Santa-san...
Completely like the old Hayama-san, isn't it?

So what did you make?
Ran away.
What's happening?
Never thought this would happen. Never.
- Ok, Sana is coming now... - Sana-chan, we have to begin shooting now.
Although it's not very fun there, if it got destroyed there's no second one.
- Ahh! It's coming! - It's scary!
If you keep acting like this, Hayama's dad is going to die.
Well, that didn't work. Then let's ask Naozumi-kun to help!
Oh, sorry about that.
Scientist?
Scientist, maybe Hayama-kun's love moved her.
Tokyo's tower's peace has been beautifully protected,
Everything's been destroyed.
Akito.
Really.
What, Natsumi?
Call me sister.
Dad was lonely by himself.
Because dad was so lonely, dad made another robot.
This one is capable of tracking you down.
What a strange world!
so there must be another reason.
Oh, somebody's here.
Sana-chan, I turned into a gold fish.
I'm an elephant. Oh, Sana-chan is a skunk.
Ha, we're the same kind.
What about an elephant?
Don't call me skunk, you pig!
Ah, it's here.
- It's no like that old lady. - Old lady!
...didn't like taking baths...
It's my fault?
He's crying now.
I thought if everybody else looked like me, they would want to be my friends.
Wait, skunk-chan.
You will take baths and clean up your own mess?

They ran away on me while I was talking...
What is this!? What's going on!? What's going on, I said!
Thank you.
Thank you. I'm sure she will come to realize that any time now, too.
If your manuscript is late this time, I'll have to face the editor--!
 It's bothering me that under I don't stand! 
For the moment, Sana forgets about her love troubles and calms down.
Let me have one too, okay, okay, okay?
The strap! The strap! The strap is going to break!
There's no way that thing is going to turn into a chick--
Mm-hmm, thank you!
I snuck out at lunch recess and bought it.
Not you again...
The truth isn't always necessarily the best thing, you know!
You know! You know! You know! You know!
It happened all right, Aono-chan! That was your egg!
It's so cute! Aono-chan's chick!
What sloppy handwriting!
Rei-kun, what were you doing yesterday? Why did Asako-san come over?
but I guess it's no use.
Sagami-kun is an adult, and you cannot be the object of his affection.
What's so wrong about telling her the truth?
Rei-kun, you're my boyfriend, after all!
Thank you.
T- there's something I...
Find some faraway, unknown city...
It's just like with that chick. Aono-chan's egg wouldn't have hatched.
It's positively...
Mm-hmm. Let's go home already. I'm hungry.
In any event, I can't go back home.
Oh, is that so? Yeah. Sure you would be.
You were a lot more extreme than me, huh?
Why don't you go home?
Stop acting so ridiculous and get yourself home!
Ha! You don't have to tell me! I'm going home!
Welcome home.
Mm-hmm.
I haven't moved on.
In my mind, I haven't changed at all since high school.
You can get back with Asako-san.

That's weird of me, huh? I'm all right...

Rei-kun, sometimes I want to stay in Japan and just relax for a while.
I haven't heard from Asako at all since the end of year.
It's possible.
That's not true!
Hi, this is Sagami.
Japanese actors and actresses are all over Hawaii for New Year's.
Will you come with me?
Happy New Year.
Sorry, Akito...

So now I can use this chance to study more.
Shimura-san, this is a neat trick.
It's a record mail!
It's clearly here.
Hello!
There, Rei-kun, the FC mark.
Special routes.
This is the video of the first episode of Kodocha.
but those are all lies, right?
We were just discussing whether we would be able to see Sana-chan's great acting skills
Yes, there are a few great opportunities we're thinking of.
- Sana-chan... - Sana-chan...
But still, the story was not coherent.
It's Naozumi-kun!
Why don't you say it out loud?
Well, let's not talk about things in the past now.
The main point is, you remembered me.
Then, what will my part be?
I don't know if I am suited for the job but I want to try it out.

This is the Cameraman and the A.D.
We've to do it before the sunset. So we can save studio rent and electrical fee.
Because we have no money.
So let's come and see the set.
Alright!
Oh, I see! This is easy easy!
This one is cute.
Sana-chan's comeback work is something like this?!
She read that as that,
Oh, what a wonderful feeling it is to be invited.
But this is too cruel! It's too cruel!
Director! Today, let's stop the multiplication now. We'll go over the rest at home.
Next is division by fraction,
Ok, Nanda-chan's line.
Sana-chan...
Anyway, it's not about if Sana-chan understands or not.
I'm like that too, and I can't understand, so do the others...
but I understand Sana-chan's reasoning.
Then she will have time to practice Nanda-chan's line.
But we don't have money...
I understand, if it means that much to you.
Ah! What is this?! A bug, a bug! It's a bug!
Hey, you still have that weird habit.
It's dull and...
I want you to do something more pretty and gorgeous.
London, huh...
And I also like working a lot.
Ah, I can't sum up my thoughts!
I give up.
Oh, but it seems they couldn't give help.
You can't do multiplication?!
we're doing even harder math, we're on algebra.
A blub blubbing sixth grade.
I wanna go to a country without math.
Sensei, can I actually improve?
If you have some trouble in the middle, you must make it clear,
Fuka and Sana work hard together. Math is life.
Life is math. It's predestinate.
Oh! I see! Easy easy!
So I think the video will come out well if we answer that question.
Wasn't Mizoguchi-san only here to review this job?
And everything will be alright, so math is life.
Ok.
Oh, this!

This is not a bit exaggerated.
...a girl as bright as a sunflower.
But... last time we saw you working for a low budget video series...
I understand now.
I understand the feelings all of you had toward the old Kurata Sana.
I know you guys don't think much of the Math Teacher video series.
See it... you punk.
Yes, videos for teaching math never sold that many copies before.
I suppose school is really fun, right?
There's a voice message for you.
Oh? Yeah, you're right.
Take me, I want you to get through this pinch
I am feeling Ultra Relax,

I already decided not to be absent.
Is it really possible?
Thank you all!
But...
The show's cast is already set, sorry.
It' Kurata Sana's latest project, it got very good reviews.
Things people like change very fast. You can't really guess what it will be next.
I missed all of these.
Don't cry when you hold my hand, I feel embarrassed.
- We're blocking you. - Of course.
Yes!
First, let's learn correct Japanese.
If you talk to us like this, we won't forgive you.
Sane-yan, I can't do this anymore.
If I keep going on like this... I will die.
- Sana-chan! - Looks like you have... no energy.
What are you talking about?
Separated we're weak, but together, nothing will scare us.
Next.
Next one.
Let's talk another time.
Why? I thought the rating were good.
- Damn it. - What are you doing?
parte b
Sana -chan, you don't have to apologize.
No, I'm the one who encouraged you to find acting jobs.
This appears again...
Tsu-san doesn't have enough experience.
I will come to haunt you.
- We should type it because that's neater. - Right.
Proposal?
Yo. What is it?
You need to impress people.
Long live friendship.
Not like this! How am I going to make you understand, you chicken head?
Thank you.
Alright. Let's go, Zenjiro-sensei.
Alright. Let's go, Sana-chan
Can't you think of some new ideas?
So that's all the hope that...
Sagami Cycle?
Union of bike racers, number 253, Sagami Rei.
A lively proposal will create a lively actor.
Kurata Sana?
Everybody!
Because I wanna try crying with you
and yet you always shilly-shally,

I may be a little jumbled,

It's been a while but how come I haven't received any news?!
Takaishi-kun...
Yeah, a long time no see, um...
Ah... Yuuta is out with his friends.
No, nothing.
- Nothing? - Hey...
You broke up with Shizu-chan because you just can't forget Matsui, am I right?
Did you remember Teen Net?
Yeah, I'm gonna try this time.
Then I'll be able to see you at the event.
It's too late now...
parte b
The long awaited new feature in Kodocha...
All OK? What kind of name is that?
It's about Zenjiro-san and Sana-chan helping people who seek for help.
so it should be a fresh idea...
There, there.
Yeah, just as I thought, there's a lot of girls, and guys!
Takaishi, what's wrong?
But I...
Fuka-chan!
Over here too.
There are too many girls here, can you find me some guys to come here?
Would you like to go to the Valentine's Event?
Sushi!
Are you hungry, Hayama-kun?
- Wow! He's cool! - Aya-chan.
Becomes this in Takaishi's eyes.
It's none of your business!
Long time no see.
Fuka-chan's ex-boyfriend is having some misunderstanding with Hayama.
Is that true, what he said?
What chance?! You have a girlfriend, don't you?! Fuka said...
You are all alone then you may tell her you love her.
I'm an idiot, I should just go home.
Please help grant Sumira this w-i-s-h!
This might be good chance!
Hey! Here's an excellent scene to record!

And there is manager-driver, Rei-kun.
Look, it's so long!
And he sent me pictures to go with it, and told me to wait for the next one.
an8I don't know what he is about either...
I won't miss school.
It's an educational yet entertaining show.
- I'll help you plan everything. - You will?
I'm your business manager,
Thanks everyone for your concern.
Must be nice being an actress.
They could go to London on study trips.
It'll be hard for her to find a job when she comes back.
Goodbye, Asako-chan.
The phone is ringing! Sensei, just a sec.
Yes, I'm Kurata Sana's manager, Sagami Rei, how are you?
Ah? Why is it Asako?
Sana-chan, you're not getting married, are you?
There'll be some people coming to interview me the day after tomorrow.
Me, Sana of course, Shimura-san...
After three years of tool, finally, I have a family again.
Asako, are you moving?
If you want to drink coffee, I'll make some more.
That's good, I heard life in London is great.
These are a collection of Sana's best work, I want him to take a look at them.
At that time... New Year's Eve...
All right, I see no problems with it.
She asked me if a long-distance love relationship was sweeter than normal.
How am I supposed to know?
Oh yeah, I should ask Asako's company.
Ah, Kinoshita-san, it's been a long time, it's Sagami.
I heard Kurumi Asako-san is going to London.
- Rei-kun doesn't smoke. - What?
The interviewers are here.
Even though I said I would wait for him.
Yes.
Could we please wait a little longer?
- Ah... - Phone is ringing, Asako-san.
Yes, hello?
Asako, please let's start from the beginning and wait in earnest this time.
It doesn't matter, however many times we do that.
Alright.
His car got towed for being parked in the street. And the police scolded him.

There is nothing you should worry about.
Who is this guy?
The milk has formed a bad omen.
- A Zombie like last time. - Zombie?
- Everything above is purely fictional. - Fictional?
But the sad thing is he hasn't changed at all.
This is the 'Monster-Chasing-Bazooka' used to keep determined pests away.
Mama, everything's ready!
Hey, Sana-chan, how are you?
Manager-sama, hello, hello!
That's what my rowdy intuition tells me.
Here's 100,000, I'll give you all of this if you stop hanging around Makoto-kun.
Makoto-kun? Who's that?
Makoto-kun, your mother is worried about you...
Well. How should I put it...
Ma... Marriage??!
I forgot I still had some work to do, excuse me.
Very typical of me, huh?
Yep, I'm very serious.
Is a pirate ship like this?
Then, Sana-chan, are you willing to see Miyoko-san?
Sana-chan and her manager are so worried.
To become a great person.
Really, where have I...
This is very worrisome.
- Let's go get their signatures! - Kurata Sana...?
Whoa! Why would there be a skateboard here?
Hey, banana peels, abacuses and skateboards?!
Shut up and get lost. If you don't go, I'll hurt Kurata Sana.
Isn't that a weird voice? That's my best friend's voice.
- Makoto-kun? - I'm Shingo.
Actually, he is a gigolo.
This thing happened because of me...
Makoto-kun, I understand that you oppose the marriage...
because I'm a very sloppy person.
But that guy is a definite 'no, no'!
To make things clear, the guys you are talking about is your mother's...
- What's this? - Tell us what's happening, uncle.
But at last I made a misunderstanding again.
She wants them to like her, so does everything to complement their interests.
When she likes someone who likes bears, she dresses like this.
But I can't see why she would worry about me.
She is very worried!
Uncle...
Mom.
It doesn't matter, as long as I'm with you, mom.
If you don't mind, I could...
She was using her own method of watching out for Makoto-kun...
What happened to the ex-husband?
I only let you stay because you had nowhere else to go.
"Wait... I want us to split up", I said
If you walk off the road you have to go along
Let's gather some courage and set this straight now
And make me the only one you love
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.

Just leave the dishes when you're done, I'll clean them up later.
Thanks, you can't leave now. Split!
What was that?
I think I was hit by something...
Dad, you're at home?
- How unsupportive. - I agree.
Is that so?
Hey, Akito, are you dating each other?
With Natsumi's good mood Sana had to get adrift.
- That was good, I'm full. - What? Finished already?
- Movie star, right? - Yeah, exactly.
She talked to me...
Look, he's going to eat his lunch.
What's going on? Does Hayama's sister know about this?
Umm... should I tell Hayama's sister?
- It's okay. - Isn't it?
- Don't push me! - Kiss!
Akito, you're home!
Sorry about that. My brother is not very social.
Ignore them...
Gosh, dad. You sound as if I was getting married soon!
We're only high school students, and besides we've only started dating.
You shouldn't be so uncertain, and say that it is none of our business.
Pick it up, quick!
How do you explain this?! Things just got worse...
Who said that I can only go out with one girl at the same time?
We're not going to break up, are we?
It's already over, senpai.

Boring, I'm going home.
Don't play innocent!
Ah...
"I did not hit him"?
Good morning, everybody!
K... Kurata?
This story is only a rumor, right?
So if Sengoku-sensei pisses you off with his little remarks, come to me.
I'll tell you how to relieve your trouble.
Sengoku-sensei, he's aiming for your karate.
Yeah, even if I trip and hit someone, he'll probably say that I abused karate.
- Hey, are you listening? - Yes.
Akito's heart has never open to others.
What?!
It's the last competition for the first year,
...and add more friends and win the district competitions and the Olympics!
Hayama! Wait!
Ok! We have to gather the members!
I'll join too.
- Onda, ink! - Yes, Sensei!
More busy it is, more like to do other things!
Your sharpness is for Karate.
No! If you get hurt in karate, it will be horrible,
I understand.
Sorry, Akito-kun, if that's God's will, I'll certainly do Aya-chan's part.
Good morning, everybody! Hayama!
Alright, there you go.
Well, that's right,
Will you...
...the end of the century will be ruled by karate...
Nowadays children are so knowing about fashion.
They choose their perfect skirts
That's mine, that's nice, isn't that life's...
Who are you?
I don't understand that.
You're stuttering, bloody nose.
Manager assistant?
You like her, don't you?
I see... Um... What class are you in?
Don't you want a clubroom?
Well, we're still not a club yet.
This is the first time I've ever been here.
Narrow, smelly, dirty.
Located in the center of the Shiga prefecture,
So let's not waste time and do some stretching.
Since I'm the manager, the two of you work hard.
Starting now, I will do the training that I usually do, so keep up with me.
- I'm Ishida! - You have a hard time.
Yeah, if it's like this then it won't be approved of as an after school activity.
I can't think of it that way.
Sorry, next time I'll be okay.
Don't get hurt!
Let me borrow it! Let me borrow it!
Cheers!

Hey you...
Absent!
Let's... sleep... together!
One more push, Hayama! We'll have enough members.
Let's make a big campaign and get one more person!
Absolutely, you're right.
Don't look at Sana-chan so lowly like that. She can do math!
Huh? Nakakaruizawa-kun?
How to say? He's not cool enough to be a karate club member.
Why isn't life all about yelling?
Wait a minute, please.
Don't expect results so suddenly.
Didn't Nakao-kun work hard? Maybe his example is worth to be refered to.
Mom, can we order ramen?
Hurry up!
Sengoku-sensei, did you see him in school?
His health is not so strong. So he made up a goal that he would never be absent.
He was absent because he felt exhausted for an after school activity.
Sengoku-sensei, the last incident was all misunderstanding.
Hayama-kun, can I have a minute?
How long can you be so optimistic?
and I was made to quit Karate Club, I have nothing left anymore!
Don't mind me.
Nakao had so much damage that he couldn't go to school the next day,
He...
He didn't want to quit?
Erasers?

And this is my real class.
The lesson began.
You, the teacher, just conceited.
Hmm. Today, the lessons will not.

If you find his weakness...
What you gonna do?

Stupid pose.
I did not want to communicate with you.
Since I believe that you somehow for me not posleduesh.
With so sparingly?
Hayam ceased to be a leader.
And others, which I love.
Stupid parent and child!

How can you something does not want what which never had?
Mommy, why are you my mother?
Khayam?
While you were at home.
I hear you've created problems at school.
Here!

There's no way I could do that, Onee-chan!
Well, it's not like I was hiding it from you or anything.
It's not like I'm telling you to strip or anything.
Hey!
Even though I was already saving money, she didn't want to worry me...
Onee-chan cares that much about me...
Well, thinking about it like that,

Why don't we go eat some cake? It'll be our treat.
P-Penis...

Fumika, give me an example.
Imagination and concentration...?
Wouldn't it be strange for someone who voices eroge to have never actually played one?
She's licking it!
Why? How come?!
I want your dick in my pussy so bad!
More, I-I'm going to cum!
Why? No! No, not this!
From Onee-chan.
You have to say it like you really feel good. With a smile.
That? What's that?
No...
Seems kind of erotic.
Yeah, it feels really good.
I didn't know it would make me this happy.
Once she gets into something, she loses sight of everything else.

They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
Show me for a sec.
Gross!
Nishimiya, are you all right?
That four-eyes really pisses me off.
Ishida...
Well, I did tell him to stop.
You're awful...

Shut up. I jumped off a bridge like always.

They were called "aliens," and they had a really hard time.
What's with you?
What are you saying?!

Hey, who was on day duty yesterday?
Hey...
Could we be friends?

Don't cry.
But it really made me happy.

Oh, right. This is good bread.
Want some, Nagatsuka?
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
Shithead.
Forget it. Let's go.
Sorry, Nagatsuka!
Damn it, they met.
I'm happy for you, Ishida.
Wait, you know sign language?
What was that for?
Nishimiya!
Did you see this?
"See you again"...
Ishida, come to the staff room.
Sho!
Boy, am I ever glad it was you.
What the heck?
I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.
Ow!
Is it too hot, Maria?
Damn it...
Just take it.

How long would you like to stay?
Right. Your friend...
Is she here?
Elaborate.
Shall we leave?
Oh, do you think Nishimiya would like this?
Cat!
Later.
Huh? You're only wearing one?
I can't. This is too funny.
...moo.
The moon? Not really, no.
Did something happen?
Hey... A bunch of us are going out soon. Wanna come with?
Beats me.
Yeah!
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
Oh, no!
Stop it!
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
H-Hey, wait.
You don't need to play peacemaker.
Sorry! I'll text you!
Are you mad?
Take this with you, Sis.
Let's not.
I had no understanding of you or your situation.
So I changed my approach.
You went crying to the adults.
So how about we take it easy from now on?
You're not even trying to talk to me.
Did something happen between her and Nishimiya?
Yeah.
You know, I tried to stop him.
But he just wouldn't listen.
You ok
All you've ever cared about is yourself.
All you care about is your sister.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
So...
Isn't she coming today?
Ito Nishimiya Funeral
Awesome!
Why are you apologizing?
Of course not!
Okay, Nishimiya?
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
Hey, Nishimiya!
Hey.
We should totally go somewhere.
That looks great!
There, there, Mom.
Looks like you avoided getting killed, Ishida.
Y-Yeah.
Come with me, Mom.
I'm coming in.
There it is.
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!

I'm sowwy...
I'm so sowwy!
What are you doing?
I'm glad you're all right.
I see.
You went and saw everyone, huh?
I'm not as strong as you.
I'm still the same old coward.
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
I'm so sowwy!
H-Huh?
Did I just do something really creepy?
I hear you came to visit.
Well, I'm out.
W-Welcome.
Get a load of this, Ishida.
M-Morning, guys.
but I don't fit in at school.
So I feel much better when I look down.
Gimme a bit more.
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
The other day
D-Did I get cold feet?
If you...
Those things happen in life.
Don't go anywhere!

Don't pretend to be a good girl!

What are you saying!
Cannot understand what you say!
Hi, Shoko-chan. Hello.
H...Hi.
This is what you left behind.
You might not want to see this again.

Oh...Please don't cry.

Dig in!
Why you are so smiling.
Oh.
Yah, actually,
I knew it...
and the calendar...
I'm really sorry.
Ouch!

By the way,
Can I see her to apologize what I did?
Woops,

Someone please help me!
Really!? You are super!
Huh, it was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.
Good morning!
Well.
What is the definition of "friends"?
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.
O...oh, really?
Sounds like a behavior of best friends?
Wh---what are you saying?!

This is enough, so let's go home.
Leave me alone!

"That is so strange."

Shoes?
I got it.
Hi, Yuzuru-kun!
Crap...
Thank you.
I won't use them anymore. I'll give you.
I had an argument with Shoko.
It's natural you know what I did, hearing from Nishimiya.
I'm the one who don't worth living.
Hey, sis!
Yuzuru.
Nice to see you!
Nagatsuka-kun, she is not a boy...
Little sis of Nishimiya.
To whom?
Then do you have someone you want to add to text?
What?
Sa...Ha...Ra.
Sahara-san? a classmate of the elementary school?
Then?
Kawai-san...
Sorry.
Sho-chan!
Oh, really..

Ishida! It's really a long time not seeing you.
I'm sorry when we were in the elementary school.
Why she has a pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?
Good-bye.

Don't make me laugh!

Huh? I simply want to be friends with him.
What!? Don't be silly!
Wait..
But it seems like that..
Oops!
you could be friends again.
I did the same things to them...
I want to go back to the time when Nishimiya-san came.
H--hey!
Well, I...
and I'll listen what you say.
After all,
to like Nishimiya herself.
What are you talking about?
What are you saying, Kawai-san?
What!? Nishimiya-san!?
Ya-sho!
Huh?
You were just looking on and laughed at her being bullied.
What!? Which side you are on!?
Stop speaking, Kawai.
Ya-sho,
See you again.
Gramma worry about you, Yuzuru.
You always care about your sis,
and I have not gone to school for a while.
Hi Nishimiya.
How you feel, how you feel?!
Ok? Nishimiya.
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy
Stop, mother! Today is your celebration day!
It was good that you didn't get killed, Ishida.
Sho-chan wanted to submit for you.
Wait, wait! Wait a moment!
Oh, a scar I made at that time...
Ishida-san.
Please..
Why in the world does Ishida have to be injured!
I'b zorry.
So,
Even after Ishida-kun wakes up,
Yu bill jange brom now on,
Ha.
Pff!
Nishimiya.
Noooo, Zat'z nod gorregd.
I ab
dodally blamed.
Just before,
Hey, customer! You arrived!
I'm not dead, Maria.
Then I'll go home.
Hi, welcome to the salon...
Is that the winter-season uniform? That's fit to you.
Oh, my. Great!
Oh, my...
Have mercy, kind sir!
You must help me!
It was said everyone are going to the school festival tomorrow.
It's time to go!
These items are used like that!
Ya-sho!
Ya-sho.
Actually I went here to raise my face to meet you all.
I'm really really happy you come back.
I would have lost everything.
thank you.
Huh?
Oh...Ishida-kun.
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.
Is it ok?
Really? Let's go together!
Ah...I fell in love...
Beginning, last time, and now
No one in the world knows
Saya ingin tutup akun
Hai. Senang berkenalan denganmu
Pinjam catatanmu.
Ini hukuman karena main-main denganku.
Ueno, baca yang benar.
semua anak pasti akan menganggapmu menyebalkan.
Sa - ara
Iya.
Minggu depan sinetronnya keluar, harus nonton nih.
Ok.
Ueno.
Eh, Nishimiya benar-benar menarik.
Huh?
Dadah, Shoya.
Bapak ingin memberi tahu sesuatu kepada kalian.
Dalam waktu lima bulan, delapan alat bantu dengar Nishimiya hilang.
Setiap alat bantu dengar berharga sangat mahal.
Apa?
Bank Mizuho
Huh?
Buku jurnal tidak ada yang isi.
"Klub Bahasa"
Shoko, selamat siang.
Lho?
Yo.
Kenapa aku bisa bahasa isyarat?
Selamat makan.
Makan yang banyak, ya.
Kamu sudah berjuang kerja sambilan.
Ibu sudah menduga ada yang aneh!
Ditambah kalender yang habis disobek!
Baguslah, tepati kata-katamu.
Apa sih yang kukatakan?
Lebih baik jangan mendekati Shoya Ishida.
Dia itu tukang risak.
aku mulai menyendiri.
-- Ishida. -- Ya?
"Ishida selalu menyendiri, ya?"
Kayaknya aku pernah lihat rambutnya.
Siapa, ya?
Diriku memang gak tahu malu, ya?
Sho-chan.
-- Hentikan! -- Lepasin!
Mengingat hari ini adalah hari Selasa.
Bukannya aku tidak suka jalan kaki.
Ini seperti pertanda dilarang bertemu.
A, apa Nishimiya ada?
Syukurlah kamu menulis alamat rumahmu.
Ishida, sebelah sini!
Ulurkan tanganmu.
Hei, Nak!
Sahabatku ingin bertemu dengan Nishimiya.
Eh, lihat itu.
Kamu berhasil, Ishida.
Hei, Bocah. Kamu mengintip mereka, ya?
Apa?
Jijik banget.
Lepasin!
Ada apa dengan Ishida?
Maaf, aku menjatuhkannya.
Apa ini?
Sebentar saja.
Shota, ada orang di dalam.
Bukankah kamu pacar Nishimiya?
Oh, kamu toh.
Kamu punya anak, ya?
Kamu sedang apa?
Sudahlah, bawa saja. Harus.
Cuma bawa satu, kan?
Kamu sudah diberi tahu Nishimiya, ya.
Akulah yang harus minta maaf.
Apa?
Aku membawanya kemari.
Tolong ajak dia ya, Ishida.
Apa aku benar?
Benarkah?
Kamu bersekolah di mana?
Potongan harga!
Ueno?
Mohon mampir, ya!
Kelab Meong-meong.
Ya, terima kasih.
Lebih tepatnya, dia bukan temanku.
Lho? Bukankah itu Nishimiya?
Sebenarnya,
Ueno, turun.
Kami cuma berteman.
Sudah pagi.
Sarapan sudah siap.
Kamu tanya aku mau ke mana?
Pakai bahasa isyarat.
Nishimiya?
Dari: Sahabatmu Nagatsuka
Aku diberi ini oleh Nishimiya tadi.
"Aku bilang aku suka kamu ke Ishida-kun"
Kawai, kenapa kamu mengganti gaya rambut?
Begitu, ya.
Ya, teman sekelas saat SD.
Ayo, Yasho, maju!
Lho?
Jangan berbuat seenaknya.
Aku mau naik roller coaster lagi.
Salaman antara orang yang saling membenci.
Apa maksudmu?
Apa maksudmu, Kawai?
Tetap saja dari awal yang salah adalah kamu.
Aku hanya mengatakan yang sebenarnya.
Aku takut pada kalian berdua.
Kawai, jangan bicara.
Yasho.
Maaf, Ishida.
Orang asing jangan ikut campur.
Yuzu.
Nenek pun sama.
Setiap hari aku hanya dimarahi Ibu.
Pulang deh.
Ishida.
Aku antar.
Enggak ada urusannya denganmu.
Karena aku khawatir padamu.
Terima kasih, Ishida.
-- Ya kan, Yuzuru? -- Meneketehe.
Besok enggak bisa, ada acara.
Apa?
Mungkin bakal dibunuh.
Kelihatan enak.
Bu, hari ini 'kan hari perayaan untuk Ibu.
Yuzuru.
Tidak semuanya.
Enggak perlu mengajakku.
Belajar?
Nishimiya!
Mulai besok aku akan mendengarkan suara orang-orang.
Bekas luka saat itu.
Akhirnya ketemu.
Aku juga diberi tahu tidak boleh menjenguk.
Nyonya Nishimiya, maaf.
Syukurlah Shoko tidak apa-apa.
Memangnya apa yang kaupikirkan?!
Shoko.
Maaf.
Saya minta maaf.
Nishimiya, kamu di sini rupanya.
Ruang Perawatan 400-417
Yasho adalah sahabat karibku.
Karena itu, kamu harus menerima hal buruk sekalipun
Nishimiya.
Kamu baik-baik saja?
Ya.
Oh iya.
Aku ingin lebih sering berbicara denganmu.
Gara-gara aku...
Andai saja aku tidak ada...
Aku tadi berbicara denganmu.
Aku melakukan hal yang tidak-tidak.
Berterimakasihlah padanya.
Siapa?
Keluarkan jeli di kulkas.
Selamat jalan!
Lho? Bukankah itu Ishida?
Ni, Nishimiya, aku bisa berjalan sendiri.
Yasho?
Nagatsuka?
Hei, Yasho.
Kamu bawa, kan?
Aku minta tolong kepada teman-teman.
Kamu hebat, ini sudah cukup.
Aku senang, soalnya aku baru pertama mendapat beginian.
Badanku gatal-gatal.
Sudahlah kalian berdua.
Aduh, sudahlah!
Danke fr alles.
Setzt euch.
Was?
Ist mir doch egal.
Ich bin taub.
Das kommt alles morgen im Test dran.
Wasser nimmt an Volumen zu, wenn es zugefroren ist.
Au!
Nerv nicht, Brillenschlange.
Willst du mich verarschen?
Was?
Aber schreiben ist fr mich viel angenehmer.
Wie sagt man "Miyoko Sahara" in Zeichensprache?
ko...
"Sa."
Findet ihr auch, dass ihre Sachen hsslich sind?
Nach etlichen Fehlversuchen, fand er heraus...
Im 18. Jahrhundert...
Was ist das?
Die Brillenschlange regt mich so auf.
Shoya's Gesicht ist ganz rot!
Was denkst du darber?
Zieh dich um.
Was? Wenn du was zu sagen hast, dann raus damit!
Sie geht mir sowas von auf die Nerven...
Wer war gestern mit sauber machen dran?
Weit du noch wer ich bin?
Bitte nicht weinen Nishimiya.
Ja?
Beeil dich dann mal besser.
Werd' ich tun, keine Sorge.
Kommst du mit raus?
Ernsthaft?
i1Die Haare hab ich irgendwo schonmal gesehen.
i1Soll ich mich wirklich mit Nishimiya treffen?
Sho...
Sorry wegen heute morgen.
Nimm dir ruhig Zeit.
Lass uns was essen.
Huh? Wieso?
Der hatte paar Schrauben locker.
Da ist er ja!
Lass uns nach der Schule was machen
Uhm... Nagatsuka...
Und das ist alles was man fr eine Freundschaft bentigt.
Eh, ich glaube Sie liegen da falsch...
Verdammt. Sie hat ihn gesehen.
Wow.
"Wer war dieser Schwachkopf?"
Pass auf, dass du nicht runterfllst.
Schon lustig, oder"
Nishimiya!
Das bist doch du, oder?
Shoya!
Jemand ist da drinn!
Bist du nicht Nishimiya's Freund?
Bist du nicht sauer?
Ow!
Mach schon.
Und so nebenbei...
Hab ich mir gedacht.
Huh...
Nishimiya hat es dir wohl erzhlt.
Oh, und noch was.
aber ich bin Shokos...
Wir werden selber entscheiden,
Gibt es jemanden dem du eine Nachricht schicken willst?
Sa... ha... ra?
Wirst du dich mit Sahara treffen?
Was gibts?
Kacke, ich hab zu wenig Geld.
Nochmals danke fr heute!
Wirklich?
"Meow Meow Club"?
Naja, weit du...
Wollen wir gehen?
Katze!
Nishimiya?
Wie immer alleine.
Warum hat sie das? Ist ja gruselig.
Oh, wirklich?
Freunde? Mit dem Mdchen, dass du gemobbt hast?
Du bringst mich zum lachen.
Worber habt ihr geredet?
Was ist mit dir los?
Ishida muss das sehen.
Warte. Sag es bitte auf Zeichensprache.
Es ist kein Problem.
Die liebst den Mond?
Das sind auch keine Sigkeiten.
Nishimiya hat sie mir vorhin gegeben.
Aber mal im Ernst. Was ist das?
Hey, Kawai.
So ist es halt mit Mdchen.
Oh.
Ich bin Mashiba.
Ist eigentlich nicht so schwer zu verstehen, aber ich habs nicht hinbekommen.
Von der Grundschule.
Los gehts!
Angst habe ich aber trotzdem.
Oh, nein!
Huh? Ich versucht doch nur freundlich zu sein.
i1Es fhlt sich so an...
Ich wollte nur, dass ihr wieder Freunde werdet.
Und du und Shimanda wren auch noch befreundet.
Ich hab irgendwie Lust mit dem Riesenrad zu fahren.
Nishimiya, lass uns Riesenrad fahren.
Ich rede extra langsam, damit auch du das verstehst,
Ich hab dich einfach ignoriert und ber dich gelstert.
Wir haben damals alles getan, was wir konnten.
Nishimiya ist wohl wirklich taub.
Du hast dich kein Stck gendert.
Worber habt ihr geredet?
Es ist die Wahrheit!
Ich hab dein Rucksack mitgebracht.
Sorry wegen vorhin.
Es war also kein "wir", es warst nur du!
Yeah.
Es reicht.
Es ist alles meine Schuld.
Was ist in dich gefahren Ishida?
Hr auf zu reden Kawai.
Ist das so?
Doch das tut es meiner Meinung nach.
Hey, Nishimiya. Willst du Morgen was unternehmen?
Ich will mit Menschen klarkommen.
Das sind die besten Sommerferien berhaupt!
Stimmts Yuzuru?
Frag mich das doch nicht.
Deine Aufgabe ist es, einen Geburtstagskuchen fr unsere Mutter zu backen.
Verschwinde!
Reicht das?
Danke.
Wann hast du Geburtstag?
Was los?
Aber die Show ist doch noch garnicht vorbei.
Nagut.
Huh?
Mir fllt gerade ein...
Oh, da ist sie ja.
Suimon Municipal Krankenhaus
Du kannst mitkommen. Er mchte dich bestimmt auch sehen.
Ich war zu nachlssig.
Es tut mir Leid.
Dir auch Yuzuru.
Sag was.
Es tut mir Leid," huh?
kotzen mich so sehr an!
Warum?
Was ist euer Problem?
Et tut...
Wollen wir wo anders hin? Ich geb dir was aus.
Du bist start.
Ich wei nicht, was ich tun soll, wenn Ishida aufwachen sollte.
Hab dich gefunden.
Nehmt mir diesen Mist ab!
Mehr oder weniger.
Oh, stimmt.
Ich hab mir wahrscheinlich alles zurecht geredet.
Et tut mi so Leid!
Ich hab mit dir geredet, bevor ich hierher kam.
Ich bin nicht tot Maria.
Ja?
Oh...
Ich geh Maria abholen.
Nichts.
Schnen Tag noch!
Wolln wir rein?
Ich habs dir nie gesagt,
Ishida!
Wenn du nicht aufgewacht wrst, dann wre alles vorbei fr mich!
Es tut mir alles Leid.
Ihh. So zum kotzen.
Oh, vergiss es.
Terima kasih kerana banyak membantu selama ini.
"Jual barang"
Hah?
Itu...
Hah?

Nanti saya akan pinjamkan awak buku nota saya.
Zudah tulomglah beti, lagan beguduh lali. sudah tolonglah berhenti, jangan bergaduh lagi
Mac sulelu bodiltahu, Mak selalu beritahu
Bagus. Seterusnya, Ishida.
Bahasa... isyarat...
Ya ke, memang sepatutnya begini.
Bagus,bagus.
Apa? Pergilah.
Saya sudah banyak kali
Apa!?
Kenapa?
Saya minta maaf banyak-banyak.
Tunggu dulu.
Saya tak tahulah.
Apa yang awak dah buat. Menjengkelkan!
Rakan sekelas dari sekolah rendah...
Ini, saya kembalikan pada awak.
Tunggu... itu apa yang awak beritahu zaman sekolah rendah dulu.
Akhirnya saya faham maksud awak...
Sebabnya...
Eh, tu- ya baiklah erm...
Kamu akan berhenti dari apa, cakap dengan jelas!
Betul.
Oh, janji ya.
Kenapalah saya sebut benda tu!?
Dia seorang...
Lalu,
Saya terpaksa berhenti jadi peminat mereka.
Teruk betullah...
Macam manalah dia nak maafkan saya?
Pelik ke kalau saya?
Te-Terkejut saya.
Apa dia?
Kamu nak buat apa?
Tunggu! Tolonglah jangan.
Diamlah wei!
Er..Erm.
Kupon diskaun untuk roti panjang kosong sahaja?
Tak ada,
Nishimiya Shoko tak ada di sini.
Yang besar dan menakutkan.
Oh ya, ini?
Ishida-kun!
Memandangkan kita sekarang sudah berkawan.
Tak ada apa.
Bunyinya macam "big friend" kan?
lesen atau hak untuk berkawan,
Bagi sini tangan kamu.
Dia tak ada ke?
Oh, bukan saya, tapi roti ini.
Jangan ke sini lagi kalau awak hanya mahu memuaskan hati awak.
Sudah cukup, kan?
Kawan saya mahu jumpa dengan Nishimiya-san!
Nagatsuka-kun, Nagatsuka-kun,
Hei, budak.
"Saya tak pasti sama ada okey tak berjumpa dengan awak lagi sekali."
Eh, ya..
Nishimiya...
Kenapa!?
Apa ni, bukan ke ini Ishida-kun?
Ah, hei.
Shoya.
Kamu, kekasih Nishimiya?
Nasib baiklah.
Saya lapar!
Ok!
Kakak macam mana?
Tak guna...
Saya diberitahu yang dia tidak perlukan saya lagi.
Awak rasa seronok dapat jaga kucing liar yang terbiar?
Oh yalah..
Soyu mina manaf, soyu mina manaf! Saya minta maaf, saya minta maaf
Saya mahu minum jus soya yang nenek tanam tu.
Kenapa kamu ke sini hari ini?
Oh, dah tentulah saya tahu tu.
Sa...Ha...Ra.
Tapi Mashiba-kun juga..
Tapi saya tahu di mana sekolah dia,
Tak mengapalah, Ya-sho.
Jadi apa?
Serangga!
Oh, awak datang ke.
Jom kita lepak kat mana-mana.
Hah, tak terima kasih sajalah.
Maaf, Nishimiya.
Tak mungkin, jangan berguraulah, Ishida?
Lawak apa ni!
Kenapa?
Tak juga.
"Ke mana awak pergi?"
Ijida-gun, gak pulur sasoh-sasoh Ishida-kun, tak perlu susah-susah
saya masih faham.
Jumpa lagi ya.
Gul-?
tapi saya tak tahu apa benda.
Wah, gaya rambut baru ya.
Boleh beritahu saya, kenapa awak ubah gaya rambut awak?
Ehh.
Hari tu,
Kalau dia masih marah, mesti dia akan menolaknya.
Y-ya.
Nagatsuka-kun, rambut kamu ni memang yang asli ke?
Eh..
Tak mengapa ke...?
Ini takoyaki. Terima kasih kerana datang.
Hei, Ueno,
Tunggu, Ishida!
Oh, saya terasa mahu naik roda ferris pula.
Ya.
Saya tak dapat faham tentang diri awak sepenuhnya.
Tapi, saya juga fikir yang awak mesti juga tak faham diri kami.
Jadi sebab itulah, mulai sekarang boleh kita berdamai sahaja?
Apa tu?
awak menutup fikiran awak, seperti yang awak lakukan 5 tahun yang lalu.
menyayangi dirinya sendiri.
Tak mungkinlah itu..
Eh!? Nishimiya-san!?
Itu awak tak rasa pelik ke.
"Kita"?
Bukan begitu, Nao-chan.
Apa yang bukan?
Saya pada masa tu..
Sahara, hentikannya.
Ya-sho,
Saya akan selalu di sisi kamu...
Maaf, Ishida.
Yuzu, kamu masih risaukan tentang kakak kamu ke?
Hari-hari saya selalu dimarahi oleh mak,
"Awak sakit perut lagi ke hari ini?"
Kenapa dengan awak hari ni?
Apa yang pelik pun... cuma cosplay!?
Saya akan hantar.
Kenapa?
Suka hatilah awak nak ikut tak.
Itu bukan salah awak pun!
Saya takkan pernah bahagia selagi saya masih bersama dengannya.
Entahlah..
Hei, Nishimiya,
Esok awak buat apa?
Dia takkan tampar saya lagi, kan?
Oh, nampak menyelerakan!
Oh yalah, hari Selasa depan akan ada festival bunga api, Ishida.
Tahun depan, kita raikan hari jadi awak bersama-sama.
Ehh, bunga api belum habis lagilah?
"Belajar"..
Oh, saya akan ikut awak.
Aduh!
Berpegang di celah bingkai!
Saya takkan lari lagi dari dugaan hidup saya.
Ni..Nishimiya..
Awak masih marah ke?
Oh, alamak...
Saya sepatutnya
Hoi, Nishimiya.
Ma...Ma..naf. Maaf
akan sedikit mengubati fikiran kakak dari ingin membunuh diri...
buat kali pertama.
Semua orang pun laluinya.
Saya
Hin.. Ini
...lebih kurang begitulah.
Nishimiya-san.
Mungkin... hanya kerana itu.
Butlan. Bukan
Saya mungkin telah banyak berputus asa dalam kehidupan saya.
Saya selalu terfikirkan perkara yang sama seperti Nishimiya.
Jadi, Nishimiya.
Nishimiya.
Pergi ucapkan terima kasih padanya.
Mungkin saya tak patut memaksa...
Ya!
Apa?
Saya mungkin akan kehilangan segalanya.
Nagatsuka-kun.
Kawai-san. Awak mungkin ada sesuatu untuk diberikan kepada Ishida-kun,
Kita masih belum habis bercakap dengan serius lagi tentang hari tu!.
Betul ni! Jom kita pergi.
Tolong dirikan wajahmu
Supaya kamu dapat melihat diriku di depanmu
We have a new classmate today.
Weird!
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hey.
Next, the "lever," where the weight is exerted.
Thank you.
Nishimiya.
Okay. Next, Ishida.
Ishida.
I'm Kita, from a special education class.
So I propose a three-minute sign language lesson every morning
Yes?
You're a bad guy.
Let's go.
It's filthy!
Wh--What?
Liar!
Stop it, you're disgusting!
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!
Let's go.
Yesterday, Nishimiya-san's mother gave us a call.
She said that eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have gone missing
or experiencing any harassment, please let us know.
Stand up right now!
Yes, yes.
You...
Why are you so wet?
Yes!
What you are doing!
What do you mean!
Oh, Shoko-chan. Hello.
Do you remember me?
Ishida Shoya.
You might not want to see this again.
Can we be
You said so in the past.
Here, Sho-chan.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
It's a long story, you know.
Promise me that you'll never try to kill yourself, or I'll burn this.
Don't be stupid, Mom...
You'll stop what, say it clearly!
It was the biggest braveness challenge of my life.
Here it is.
Oh.
How can I find a way to meet with her?
Am I weird if I visit again?
Stop it, please.
It was stolen.
I'm glad that I got it back to you!
Hey.
Do you want some bread?
Ishida-kun!
Ishida-kun!
You can tell me anything, 'cause we're real friends.
or right or something like that,
Hey, Ya-sho.
She isn't.
I followed you.
Turd-hair, turd-hair, turd-hair!
Nagatsuka-ku...
Wow, I didn't know that he had the skill.
Tsk!
Be careful to not fall, boy.
"Honestly,"
Ishida-kun...
"the same thing as you."
Huh?
Eh? Ishida-kun jumped in!
"See you again"
Hey...
I got it.
No, I can't.
Now you've learned sign language, huh?
You're disgusting.
But...
Bye!
Nishimiya-san's mother...
Hey.
I wanna drink Grandma's beefsteak plant juice.
Don't be friends with such a guy.
Why are you here today?
Nagatsuka-kun, she's not a boy...
Don't joke around. I'm not that kind of girl.
Kawai-san...?
I... I have
I see.
A restroom.
Discount coupon!
Yes, you can.
Insect!
Maria's fun to play with.
Huh?
Looks like she's still alone.
No, thank you.
Actually,
I'm sorry about elementary school.
Ueno, get off.
Oh... I see.
Good-bye.
Hey!
Just friends.
Friends?
Why?
Oh, is it a sense of guilt?
A ponytail today? Why?
Huh?
Then bye.
Oh?
Nishimiya?
Huh? A gift?
What are these?
I... ige... moo...
Candy?
"I said 'I like you' to Ishida-kun."
Why did you change your hairstyle?
Miyo-chan, long time no see.
Maybe she's avoiding me...
but I couldn't understand her.
I couldn't understand her simple words.
I guess that would make her mad.
Then let's start!
She's in my high school class.
I was a coward at that time.
No, don't act like a child!
You need my permission to speak to Ya-sho!
Go, Ya-sho, go!
Let's buy some together.
Ishida!
Are you angry?
No, I'm not.
Now I want to ride a Ferris wheel.
Nishimiya-san, let's go on a Ferris wheel.
I ignored you and talked about you behind your back.
I... I'b zorry...
You've always told me cruel things!
Ya-sho...
Hi, Ishida.
Hey, Ishida-kun, you're here!
We have no right to blame him for this matter.
Hey, Sahara, what about you?
Ueno.
Don't decide everything by yourself.
saying "I was a coward."
Sorry, Ishida.
Here.
and I haven't gone to school in a while.
as wonderful as you,
Huh...?
Hey, Yuzu...
I want to think that it does.
"Funeral site for Ito Nishimiya"
Hold it, Yuzuru!
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy
I don't know...
Let's go out somewhere tomorrow, too!
Is it okay for me to be here?
What?
Not necessarily.
I'd like to pass.
Did she enjoy the party?
I see.
By the way, Nishimiya, I...
Sho-chan,
Onee-chan made pancakes for you.
Please raise your heads.
All that matters is that Shoko-chan is safe.
How pathetic!
She's holding it shut!
How about going to the lobby? I'll buy you a drink.
I heard about what happened with you and Ya-sho.
Kawai-san, you're too loud...
Everyone has, don't you think so?
I couldn't change myself.
Thank you for meeting me, Sho-chan.
Mom!
I never really apologized for what I did in the past.
Or for what I did after we met again.
Perhaps,
So, Nishimiya.
Customer! You've arrived!
You're great!
Die? Die?
Welcome back!
Then I'll go home.
Thank you.
Have mercy, kind sir!
Oh!
I can walk by myself, you know.
Ishida-kun? Hey, it's Ishida-kun!
Ya-sho!
Huh?
N--no, it's amazing!
Nao-chan, why are you saying something like that now?
Oh... Ishida-kun.
Is it okay?
Hey, the stall by Class B is really good!
be1Lucky you, Ishida. It's a girl.
be1Her nickname's Sho.
be1Gimme your notebook.
be1I was distracted for half the class again.
be1Screw you too, four-eyes.
be1Start from here.
be1Alright, good. Next, Ishida.
be1Bye-bye, Nishimiya.
be1you need to be smarter about things, or people will start to hate you.
be1It's a language where you use your hands.
be1You can have entire conversations with just hand gestures.
be1In order to talk to Shoko lots more,
be1Isn't writing in her notebook good enough?
be1I'll do it. I'll learn sign language.
be1mi - go.. ko.
be1Aren't her clothes lame as hell?
be1You're going too far, man.
be1Back in the Jomon period...
be1It's about Shoko Nishimiya, who's absent today.
be1Have any of you spotted any acts of bullying or harassment toward Nishimiya?
be1Huh? Why is this here?
be1Shoya, your teacher told me everything.
be1Shut up, I jumped off a bridge like always.
be1Are you causing trouble for others?
be1We're going to see the Nishimiyas. Get ready.
be1I don't understand what you're saying!
be1Nishimiya transferred out.
be1Uh...
be1I'm learning it.
be1Sho's up!
be1Thanks for the food.
be1Why'd you want to kill yourself?
be1I'll burn the 1.7 million yen you shed blood, sweat, and tears to earn!
be1Oh...
be1I won't do it!
be1but...
be1Ishida.
be1Figures.
be1Let go, dude.
be1Oh, dear.
be1You can take mine.
be1I didn't get it back.
be1but I feel like the universe is telling me not to go.
be1Excuse me for asking,
be1Nothing.
be1Why?
be1I'm glad it had your address on it.
be1How stupid.
be1Oh, no. They're fighting.
be1Ew, what is this?
be1Nishimiya!
be1Someone's inside!
be1About what?
be1Oh, that was you?
be1Sho!
be1Ow!
be1Oh, Yuzuru.
be1Wanna wear these?
be1So, like, relationship problems and all that?
be1Trying to make yourself feel better by helping a stray cat?
be1I know you made fun...
be1And now you've learned sign language?
be1Oh, right.
be1I'm shoko's...
be1You know...
be1Crap. I'm running low on cash.
be1What!? I don't need that much!
be1Remember me?
be1What a pleasant surprise.
be1What's your cup size?
be1Let me check!
be1We're giving out discount coupons!
be1Crap. He really came.
be1Long time no see, Nishimiya! How have you been?
be1Huh? You're only wearing one?
be1Friends? That's hilarious!
be1I'll get going, then.
be1To the baker's.
be1Wait. Use sign language.
be1Sorry!
be1Thanks.
be1Do these look like the moon to you?
be1Hey, Kawai.
be1No special reason, really.
be1The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
be1Ishida.
be1Can I sit with you, Sahara?
be1Sure. Go ahead.
be1I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
be1Huh?
be1Huh?
be1Thank you.
be1Are you mad?
be1I was just hoping you two could go back to being friends.
be1Nishimiya, ride the Ferris wheel with me.
be1I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
be1But you never tried to understand me, either.
be1That's why you'd obliviously hand over your stupid notebook,
be1And anytime something happened, you'd immediately apologize.
be1They were signs to stay away from me.
be1I still hate you,
be1Don't you agree, Ishida?
be1You ok-
be1I was scared of you both back then.
be1All you care about is your sis.
be1You're not at all trying to figure yourself out.
be1This bread...
be1It's good, like you.
be1Heya!
be1Later.
be1We should totally go somewhere.
be1Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
be1Yum!
be1Pardon me...
be1Nishimiya? I'm coming in.
be1Did I ever actually apologize to her?
be1Sorry.
be1I'm sorry, Nishimiya.
be1Sho.
be1I called the shop, but nobody answered.
be1Please raise your heads.
be1I'm so sowwy!
be1Yasho accepted a weirdo like me.
be1Kawai, you're being too loud.
be1I couldn't change.
be1Nishimiya!
be1Hey.
be1Nishimiya...
be1And everything after that, either.
be1I wanted to talk to you more.
be1And forced you into making the worst possible choice.
be1Isn't that Ueno?
be1Ishida.
be1Get a load of this, Ishida.
be1You started going to school, huh?
be1I wanna live up to her expectations.
be1And, thank you.
be1Oh, and... What's with the moustache?
be1You too, Mashiba.
be1What's your problem, Kaway? You wanna go?
be1You apologized again.
be1Well, I guess that's just who you are.
be1She ran away.

Okay, introduce yourself.
Watch your mouth, Nao.
Do you have a nickname?
Nice.
Levers fall under three classes based on their locations.
I'll copy my notes for you later.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Have you all heard of sign language?
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll do it.
Via this book, the author...
"Nishimiya..."
Really? I think it's just right.
Bad, bad boy.
How mean.
You're welcome.
Have any of you spotted any acts of bullying or harassment toward Nishimiya?
Are you causing trouble for others?
They were called "aliens," and they had a really hard time.
That look again?
I'm dryig, ju no!
Hello there, Shoko.
You forgot this.
Breakfast time!
You mean it?
It's a promise, okay?
Ow!
Morning.
i1"Ishida's always by himself, huh?
Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
Figures.
i1Who was he, again?
i1But man, who do I think I am?
i1Maybe I could go apologize for making her cry?
i1She said she'd be there every Tuesday.
Sho...
I'll earn it again.
Come, let's eat.
i1Who, me?
Huh? For what?
Let go, dude.
I-Is Nishimiya here?
Friends...
Ishida!
Dumped in a paddy field.
Let's go hang out after school today.
To mark the start of our friendship.
Is something wrong, Yasho?
We're best friends.
I think friendship defies logic or words.
"Don't know him at all."
I've spent the past two weeks thinking about what friendship means.
"I'm so glad.
I was thinking the same thing.
Here, Nishimiya.
You okay?
Coming.
Great.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
You can have them.
Oh, right.
Little sister?!
Sowwy! Sowwy!
How are you doing?
What brings you here today?
This is my friend Nagatsuka.
I-I got a cellphone.
Yasho, Yasho.
Sahara?
Ishida, take this.
Hey!
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
I've kept studying sign language.
Huh...
Welco
Bug!
The poor thing.
I've always felt I should've reached out to you.
We're friends.
What's up?
Sis...
Nishimi
See you.
Thank you.
The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
Long time no see, Miyo!
Why?
She was trying her best to tell me something the other day, and I couldn't get it.
Well, if you're worried she's avoiding you, ask her to hang out.
What's with her?
I learn so much from her artistic sense.
When I was in grade school, I was too scared to ride a rollercoaster.
i1But this feels kinda like...
Are you mad?
Yes, we are.
The thing with Shimada...
Hey.
What? How?
I hate you.
Let's not.
I had no understanding of you or your situation.
You went crying to the adults.
Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.
But I'm not about to tell you we should be friends now.
So what?
What right do we have to criticize Ishida over it?
You're asking me?
You're just gonna run and regret your cowardice again, anyway.
All you've ever cared about is yourself.
It's okay.
Summer break starts next week.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
Your heart is pure.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
It's good, like you.
What the heck?
Isn't she coming today?
And why is that?
Don't start talking like my grandma.
Why are you apologizing?
Shall we go watch a movie?
Don't ask me.
You look good.
Yum!
Looks like you avoided getting killed, Ishida.
Wait, what?
Is it charged?
Nishimiya!
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1Did I ever actually apologize to her?
i1I should've asked her how she felt about me.
Oh, Yuzuru.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Stop it.
What was I supposed to do?
Kawai, you're being too loud.
We were so worried!
Everyone goes through difficulties in life.
Nihimiya!
Come on. Don't cry.
If only I were gone...
Ishida...
Thank you.
This suits you much better.
Oh, Sho.
I beg ya, boss!
You started going to school, huh?
Have a nice day!
Yasho?
Nagatsuka...
I brought them, but I can't give him those. They came out really badly.
Nah. You're amazing.
Why do you have to be like that?
You were going through so much, but I was no help.
They're not talking about anything serious.
May I?
Let's check out the gym next.
We have a new classmate from today.
Then introduce yourself.
Huh?
teach you the timing, ok?
Ouch, ouch!
I missed what teacher said again due to her...
I am not wrong.
Hahaha...
Bye-bye, Nishimiya-san.
Disgusting!
As the word says, Shuwa means speaking using your hands.
So I propose a 3-minute lesson of sign language everyday morning,
Ni-shi-mi-ya.
You are welcome.
Hey, Ishida.
Does this mean you can actually hear?
Crap, so annoying, ugly glasses.
Let's go.
Well...so...
What!?
Don't you cause trouble with someone?
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?
Huh.
H...Hi.
friends?
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
It's a long story you know,
I knew it!
Ok, that's a promise.
Hey! Mom!
"Friend"
a bully.
"Ishida-kun is always alone as you can see."
H...Hi, here it is.
I just bought this limited edition, and...
Oops.
Me too.
I'm very sorry for what happened in the morning.
Me?
I'm askin you 'cause I don't have one.
Please, please help me! Help! Help!
The reason.
Well...Is Nishimiya-san here?
She is, isn't she?
Why...is he here?
Huh, it was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.
Oh, I see.
Well.
friendship exists beyond such words and logic.
Don't come here again, if you only want to satisfy yourself.
Then bye.
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!
This is enough, so let's go home.
What?
S-T-O-P J-O-K-I-N-G!
"Reason to"
To feed carp.
Is feeding them fun?
What!? Something happened to Ishida-kun!?
Nishimiya.
Did you see this?
Can I?
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?
What?
I also uploaded that photo to the web.. "
H..hey!!
Hey, are you ok?
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?
What are you doing here?
...Why don't you get angry with me?
I am hungry!
Ok!
Huh?
Anyway, use it!
Hey, you live together with her!?
You have only one, don't you?
You understand?
Oops!
I wanna drink gramma's beefsteak plant juice.
Both I and sis.
Hey boy!
You are doing a good thing.
Nagatsuka-kun, she is not a boy...
Na-ga-tsu-ka.
Kawai-san...
something to ask to you.
Sorry, I don't know...,
She mad at you because you are to looking for a past classmate without her.
So take her with you, Ishida.
Walking from here..
Sho-chan?
Hum, hum...
And, hey, your chest got big, you know.
What you cup size?
Can I bring Ueno around, too?
Huh? Naturally impossible, you know?
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.
To the "Mew mew club"!
What in the world did you expect?
I gave it to her.
H..hey!!
No, not like that.
Friend?
No.
Nishimiya..
"Where are you going?"
Iz mai voize stranze?
Huh? You're giving me this?
...ige...oo...
That's good idea.
Follow me so that you don't lost!
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?
Are you all ready?
But I've changed a bit.
"Are you ok?"
Haha.
Huh?
Can I have fun like this?
Hey!
Hey, Ishida!
Oh!
I just thought
We are not.
Hi, welcome back Yuzuru-chan.
Hi.
I hate you.
Let's not use it.
and always smiled insincerely.
But,
Our view was very narrow in our childhood,
But how about being peaceful between you and me?
So what?
Then?
Ueno--san, right?
Kawai-san said there were something in elementary school.
After all, Ishida-kun has not changed at all from the past!
Ishida-kun used to bully a girl in the past.
Oops...
Mashiba-kun said so, and..
Stop it.
You should not treat me like yourself.
Hey, answer now, Sahara!
Ya-sho..
See you again.
Sorry, Ishida.
You'll hurt your eyes reading in such a dark place.
and I have not gone to school for a while.
How about a sweet manju?
Actually, what's wrong with you?
I got a text from my sis. I have to go.
"Funeral site for Ito Nishimiya"
How about tomorrow?
Is it ok for me to be here?
Oh, it looks delicious!
Huh..
Not necessarily so.
Is here good? Yes, yes.
You're 18 years old already.
I won't escape from my challenges of life.
Are you still mad?
Sis made pancakes for you.
I am very sorry.
Oh, please stop it.
Ishida saved my stupid sister.
How confident you are!
alone in your own head,
it's so annoying!
Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...
you shouldn't have had her in the first place!
I'b zorry!
Crap, it can't be opened.
Oh, Nishimiya-san?
as a whole including weaknesses.
Are you doing well?
Strange, isn't it?
I think...
Nishimiya
Ahahaha.
Well..
I'm ok now too
I never really apologized for what I did in the past,
I learned sign language
I ab
Well, Nishimiya.
that it still wasn't worth dying over.
You are doing great!
She took care of you while you were asleep.
Yes. Shoko gave me a good reason to go back.
Good luck!
Ni..Nishimiya..
I'm very sorry
By the way, what's happened with your mustache?
This was a pray icon for your recovery.
Nagatsuka-kun.
Kawai-san. you have the you-know-what to give him,
but I couldn't. It is far less than a thousand...
I asked all the classmates again and again, but..
That's enough.
You are always saying horrible things, Nao-chan!
Time to fight?
Don't say so.
I have not changed, too.
Stu--pid. Ba  ka
Hummm, it tastes really good!
I'm amazed he can even show his face at school.
Here's your money back
Please use it when you need to talk to me.
I'm deaf.
Uh...
Pages 20 through 25, and the practice problems on page 32.
Finally, there's the load that is raised or lowered.
Nishimiya.
You, uh, went too early.
Once more, from the top.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Could you tell me what you were talking about?
Bye bye, Nishimiya.
You need to be smarter about things, or people will start to hate you.
It's a language where you use your hands.
I'll do it.
Right?
Let's bounce.
Where were we, again...
Hey, Nishimiya.
Nishimiya, are you all right?
I'm sorry.
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Ueno.
We're really sorry for everything.
Hold it, Shoya!
I'm dryig...
Get lost, Ishida. How long are you gonna stick around?
For Conversations - Shoko Nishimiya, Class 6-2
Wait, she was saying the same thing back in grade school.
Don't cry.
Here you go, Sho.
By the way, Sho...
All the pages were ripped off from April...
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
i1He's famous for it. Everyone knows."
Seriously?
Hey, could you let me borrow your bike?
Huh? For what?
Hey, knock it off.
Somebody help!
Anybody!
Hey!
Uh...
N-Nothing.
Makes us seem like big friends, right?
And? Is something on your mind?
Hold out your hand.
She's not here.
Well, that sucks.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
I followed you.
Stop it.
Crap!
Are you peeping at them?
Ishida's waving his hands around.
Let go.
Funny, right?"
Er...
Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.
What's wrong?
Hey, laddy!
Did you see this?
Suspension Notice The following student has failed to follow the school's code of conduct in public and has thus been suspended for a week. Class 3-B - Shoya Ishida
Oh, that was you?
Here, Yuzuru.
Is it too hot, Maria?
What are you doing?
Man...
Oh, right.
Yuduru!
Sis?
Sowwy! Sowwy!
You're pretty responsible.
Nagatsuka, that's not a "laddy."
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
D-Do you text your friends and stuff?
From your high school?
What?
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
What is it?
Ishida, take this.
Thanks again for today!
Sho!
How long would you like to stay?
Seriously?
Bug!
U...
Wait, what?
Oh, yeah.
Isn't that Nishimiya?
Not really.
You have your hair in a ponytail today.
Nishimi
Ishida, were are you goig?
Yuzuru asked me to buy some bread for the carp.
Wait. Use sign language.
I-I need to go buy the bread.
For me?
For real?!
Cut it out, guys.
No special reason, really.
She was trying her best to tell me something the other day, and I couldn't get it.
Huh?
i1Huh?
I'm not mad.
I was just hoping you two could go back to being friends.
What the hell is up with that?
What about her?
What's wrong, Yasho?
Mishiba, Ishida once bullied a girl.
But he just wouldn't listen.
Yasho?
Yasho!
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
Sorry about earlier.
Still, Mashiba said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya.
Yasho...
Sho.
Sorry, Ishida.
You think?
Mom keeps yelling at me every day.
This bread...
School, duh.
Why?
Ito Nishimiya Funeral
Nishimiya?
I wanna see the ocean.
Hey.
Right, Yuzuru?
Hey, Nishimiya.
Are you sure about this?
A-Are you really, really sure?
Sho said you should take part.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
It already passed!
You need to study?
Huh?
Could you go get my camera for me?
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1From tomorrow,
i1I'll look at people's faces.
i1Are you still mad?
Suimon Municipal Hospital
Oh, Yuzuru.
Ishida.
Nishimiya?
I'm sorry.
You too, Yuzuru.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Stop it!
Are you Shoko?
It's not opening.
I want to fix what I destroyed
You went and saw everyone, huh?
What's all this?
Nishimiya.
Nishimiya...
Or everything after that, either.
I'm so sowwy!
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
Forget what I just said!
Are you gonna die?!
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya.
Oh, Shimada and Hirose were the ones who pulled you up when you fell.
This suits you much better.
I'll go pick up Maria.
Please tutor me!
Shall we?
I can walk just fine.
I think my tummy hurts.
Sorry.
Hey, Nagatsuka. Morning.
I'm so glad you're all right!
Also, thank you.
I heard Nagatsuka screaming out your name.
And I'm sorry.
Oh, forget it.
I'll go get some fried chicken.
I'd like us to check out the festival together.
Count me in.
Shoya Ishida
Last day
A Silent Voice
I'm deaf.
Oh.
Do you have a nickname?
I give up! I'm tapping out!
What? Not nice.
Okay, note down the following sections.
Gimme your notebook.
Ow, that hurts.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Next, Ishida.
What?
Sign language...
Teach me how to say "Miyoko Sahara" in sign language.
I'll wipe it for you, okay?
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
Show me for a sec.
What do we do?
Before you end up causing any more trouble for your parents...
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
And Shimada?
Wait...
You're so mean, Ishida!
Yes, of course!
Huh?
What are you doing?
That look again?
Get lost, Ishida. How long are you gonna stick around?
Uh...
Sho!
Breakfast time!
Have a nice day.
W-Well, a lot happened...
Oh...
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
i1I found myself all alone.
Have this translated by next time.
Yes?
i1Will he spend his whole life like that?
I bought this on release day.
i1But man, who do I think I am?
Hey, could you let me borrow your bike?
Anybody!
Uh...
She's not.
but are you really friends with her?
I sit behind you, you know.
Want some, Nagatsuka?
Ishida!
We're best friends.
You know, does one need to fulfill any requirements to be a friend?
Look, Yasho.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
Shithead.
Excuse me? What's your problem?
Stop it.
Crap!
Wait, you know sign language?
Ishida...
Here, Nishimiya.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
Man...
That won't happen.
Little sister?!
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...
I'm sorry.
Yuduru!
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
This is my friend Nagatsuka.
Wow, nice.
Will you go see this Sahara?
But I do know which school she goes to.
Ishida, take this.
Hey!
Long time no see, huh?
Wait, is that right?
I've been worried about you ever since.
I'm really glad to see you again.
Huh...
By the way, your chest has gotten bigger.
Please visit!
What? Not happening.
All right.
W-W-We have a discount coupon.
Don't be stupid.
Right. Your friend...
Bug!
Oh, yeah.
The poor thing.
Not really.
Oh, really?
What are you doing, Ueno?
Of course not.
Is it out of guilt or something?
Nah.
What we were talking about?
I'm up. Too surprised to sleep.
What a weird face.
Massive outbreak of carp today. Not certain how many people will come feed them. Be there.
We have enough. Yuduru jud waned do eat.
It's fine, really.
See you.
Thank you.
Can
Why'd you change it?
Did something happen?
That's how it goes with girls.
Why are you here?
Long time no see, Miyo!
They're such simple words, but I couldn't understand them.
Can I sit with you, Sahara?
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.
You're funny, Nagatsuka.
Is your hair natural?
i1Do I have any right to have so much fun?
I want to back to how things were before she came.
Video of the Ferris wheel?
Secretly filmed them.
You went crying to the adults.
I hade mysel.
Don't you agree, Ishida?
Calm down, Kawai.
What are you saying, Kawai?
Heya.
Sorry about earlier.
Wait a second.
You've got it wrong, Nao.
Got what wrong?
Unlike me, you went out of your way to bully Nishimiya.
Mean!
Enough.
What's gotten into you, Ishida?
Yasho...
Sho.
Ishida, you're too awful.
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
Hey, Yuzu
Guess I'll go home.
Do whatever you want.
That scared me.
Even monsters have hearts...
Hey, Nishimiya.
Who asked you two?
Yeah. You think she was happy?
See you.
What are you doing, Nishimiya?
i1Please give me one last ounce of strength.
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
Your sister made pancakes.
Ishida.
You too, Yuzuru.
And who the hell are you?!
It's not opening.
I destroyed everything Ishida had built up
You know,
Oh.
and forced you into making the worst possible choice.
Are you gonna die?!
I'm not dead, Maria.
Isn't that Ueno?
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya.
Thank you.
Sure.
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
So please, Yasho...
Also, thank you.
A prayer so you'd wake up as soon as possible.
You got them?
This is plenty!
She ran away.
So?
For Conversations
Her nickname's Sho.
Nice.
Gimme your notebook.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Screw you too, four-eyes.
You know...
It's a language where you use your hands.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll learn sign language.
And a star.
Really? I think it's just right.
There.
All gone.
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
Ueno.
Ugh, what is this?
That four-eyes really pisses me off.
Have any of you spotted any acts of bullying or harassment toward Nishimiya?
Ishida...
She really pisses me off...
Nishimiya?
Hey.
Why I know sign language?
Wake up!
Have a nice day.
Here's your money back
But it really made me happy.
Oh...
Uh... I'm sorry!
Friends...
Figures.
Seriously?
i1Can I really go see Nishimiya again?
For burning all that money you earned.
Hey, knock it off.
i1I need an excuse...
I-Is Nishimiya here?
She's not here.
Nothing.
Dumped in a paddy field.
Oh, right. This is good bread.
Makes us seem like big friends, right?
Uh, she's right there.
Here, take the bread, at least.
Are we done here?
No, you're wrong...
Sorry, Nagatsuka!
Crap!
Er...
Wait, Nishimiya!
What's wrong?
Ew, what is this?
Sorry I dropped it.
This guy.
and then uploaded a photo of it to the internet...
Aren't you mad?
She's my sister's!
Is it too hot, Maria?
Just take it.
Seriously.
Knew it.
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.
You can have them.
I had a fight with Shoko.
Man...
You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?
Oh.
That won't happen.
But this also concerns me...
You're pretty responsible.
Is there anyone else you'd like to text?
Hey.
Long time no see, huh?
I've kept studying sign language.
I left all of a sudden...
Let me check!
Take one.
Ueno?
"Meow Meow Club"?
Things are pretty awkward right now.
Shall we leave?
Gift for you. I'll leave it here.
Oh, really?
Nothing, really.
See you.
Can I open it?
Can
But it didn't get through to him.
Why are you here?
Beats me.
You're being rude to my Yasho!
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.
I want takoyaki.
Thank you.
You don't need to play peacemaker.
I'm not.
Nobody asked you.
Do you hate me?
Take this with you, Sis.
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.
Huh? Why do you ask?
Wait, is that why she was bullied?
Don't you agree, Ishida?
Nishimiya?
It was so scary.
Wait a second.
Ah.
Enough.
You don't have to put it like that.
Is that so?
You're a good girl.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
And why is that?
Don't start talking like my grandma.
I'll be fine from here.
I'm still scared.
Where are we going tomorrow?
What are you making?
Y-Yeah.
I picked a photo and submitted it to the prefectural photography contest.
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
Come on. Let's go.
But the show isn't over yet.
But...
Shoko!
Auntie!
I finally got to see you.
People like you, who can only see things from their own point of view,
Stop...
What is wrong with you two?
I'm glad you're fine.
I'm so sowwy!
Listen, Nishimiya.
I want you to help me live.
I'm not dead, Maria.
Welcome back.
Thanks for having me.
I'm sorry.
Winter uniform?
I wanna live up to her expectations.
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
From: Shoko Nishimiya Hello Everyone was talking about going to your school's festival tomorrow. I'll be waiting by the front gates at 10. Yuzuru and Mom will come later.
I can walk just fine.
Yasho...
Hey, Yasho.
Those things happen in life.
Thank you, Kawai.
You too, Mashiba.
Huh?
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
"Bank"
I'm not interested at all.
"Nice to meet you. I am Shoko Nishimiya."
I see, "Sho-chan".
What? That's not funny at all!
I missed what the teacher said again because of her...
I am not wrong.
Mom zayz dizgazdingly,
What?
Disgusting!
As the word says, Shuwa means speaking using your hands.
Teacher.
It's easier for Shoko-chan using sign language.
"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"
Got it!
Congrats, Nishiyama-san. Sahara-san left because of you!
erase... it... for... you...
All erased.
Class is not over.
Oh, what is this?
Let's go home.
If you want to say something to me, say it!
Huh?
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?
"Hey, stop it" to him,
Shoya.
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?
I'b doigg mah bezd!
"Sign Language Study Club"
I was your classmate in elementary school...
H...Hi.
Well...
Well...
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Sho-tan, wake up!
Right now promise you will never try to kill yourself, or I'll burn this.
Hey, well, ah...
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'll stop. I'm sorry.
I'll stop trying to kill myself!
Really!
Ouch!
He is...
Please finish it soon as the deadline is coming up.
"Isn't he feeling desolate, always being alone?"
Oops.
Do I have a reason?
Thanks.
You are hungry, huh? Let's have dinner.
Please, please help me! Help! Help!
I...I'll lend you mine.
Really!? You are super!
It was ripped off.
Wh...where was the bike?
You can tell me anything, cause we are true friends.
What is the definition of "friends"?
Hey, Ya-sho.
O...oh, really?
Wow, I didn't know he knew that.
Hey, you can read their sign language.
I don't know such turd.
Leave me alone!
Huh?
Why did you do it!
Can I?
Hey.
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?
Someone is in there!
You'll catch a cold.
Oh, you did it.
You have only one, don't you?
I don't want Nishimiya's boyfriend to get wet and sick.
You like taking care of a poor stray cat?
Do you think you have changed into a good person?
I'm the one who doesn't deserve living.
But, at least,
Thanks, it's enough here.
Bye!
Little sis of Nishimiya.
I'm glad to see a friend of my best friend Ya-sho.
Don't joke. I'm not such a girl.
Do you know the phone number or something to contact
Sorry, I don't know,
Don't mind, Ya-sho.
Huh? Ishida-kun?
Oh, really?
Discount coupon!
Let's go home then.
U--Ueno..
Go, go!
Ishida! It's been really a long time since seeing you.
Why does she have the pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?
Nishimiya-san, long time no see! Are you all right?
Just friends.
Ishida, you have became such a boring guy.
"What were you two talking about"?
Yuju,
Oh.
Whea are yu goig, Ijida-gun?
"I said I like you to Ishida-kun"
But he didn't understand what I said.
Huh...
I was in a bit of rush this morning, that's all.
But that looks great anyway.
Hi, Kawai-san.
said he wants to be friends with you.
I can't understand very simple words she said.
Hmmmm...
"Are you OK?"
What!? Don't be silly!
Mashiba-kun, go faster!
Hey!
I did the same things to them...
As for things with Shimada,
Huh?
So let's shake hands, even though we both hate each other.
I hade myzelf...
Ueno--san, right?
Yes. Ueno?
Did Nishimiya-san have trouble with her?
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.
After all, Ishida-kun has not changed at all from the past!
What!?
What's wrong?
Hey, Ishida-kun, you are here!
I'm sorry what happened in the classroom, Ishida-kun.
if Ishida-kun apologizes first,
What!? Whose side are you on!?
You simply like yourself the most.
Why don't we go somewhere fun together?
I don't think so.
Hummm, does this sound strange?
Huh...?
Well..
Uhh..
Bye.
Nishimiya said that
I want to love a person,
Yuzuru.
Let's go together.
Let's go together.
Well, thank you for inviting me to your house the other day.
"Study"..
But..
Good evening..
Huh!
Nishimiya!
I won't run from my challenges im my life.
I'll look at everyone's face.
Sis made pancakes for you.
It's cold..
Oh, please stop it.
Please raise your heads.
Please..
What are you doing!?
I heard things between you and Ya-sho in the past.
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun created working so hard."
I am relieved to know you are OK now.
you are going around to get the members to meet at the bridge.
Yu bill jange brom now on,
Strange, isn't it?
Get rid of this!
Perhaps,
Noooo, Zat'z nod gorregd.
I ab
dodally blamed.
I thought the same way as you.
But,
I want to apologize to the others, too.
Hey, customer! You arrived!
What!? Who is that guy?
Hi.
By the way, a school festival will be held tomorrow?
Everyone said they are going to the school festival tomorrow.
I will meet you at the front gate at 10:00, it that OK?
Huh?
for so many things.
And, I am sorry.
while I have not changed a bit.
Ah...I fell in love...
I'll convey you carving on petals which are fluttering
Darling
We have a new friend joining us today.
Lucky you, Ishida.
Her nickname's Sho.
I was distracted for half the class again.
Bud I don inden do abologize.
Take this seriously, Ishida.
Frens...
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.
Hada...
Looking good!
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
See you tomorrow.
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.
Stand up already!
Yes, sir!
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
We're really sorry for everything.
Yeah, it's true!
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!
and it pisses me off!
Come on, out with it!
Nishimiya!
Remember me?
Oh.
Hey...
Wake up, Sho!
But it really made me happy.
So I was right!
Ow!
W-Water!
i1But...
Have this translated by next time.
Have you submitted your math notebook yet?
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
Great.
i1Why does he even live, then?"
Figures.
i1She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.
Hey, could you let me borrow your bike?
Somebody help!
i1And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.
i1I need an excuse...
I need a really neat, natural-sounding excuse.
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
Look at this!
I'm Nagatsuka.
Ishida!
To mark the start of our friendship.
Wait, Yasho?
You know, does one need to fulfill any requirements to be a friend?
Hey, laddy!
No, you're wrong...
Ow!
Let me see!
Wait, Nishimiya!
Sorry I dropped it.
Come on, you can go for a bit.
Boy, am I ever glad it was you.
Sho!
Oh, Yuzuru.
You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Let's go.
Hey, laddy.
Wow, nice.
I'd like to ask you something.
Remember Sahara from grade school? Do you know how to contact her?
But I do know which school she goes to.
Sis was pissed off you were leaving her out even though she was the one who asked.
What's your cup size?
We're giving out discount coupons!
We're giving out discount coupons!
O-One hour, please.
Well, you know...
Right. Your friend...
Bug!
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
We're friends.
Friends? That's hilarious!
Nothing, really.
Id monig.
What a weird face.
To the baker's.
Say, Nagatsuka.
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.
Why'd you change it?
The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
She was trying her best to tell me something the other day, and I couldn't get it.
That she loves the moon.
I learn so much from her artistic sense.
Though I am still terrified.
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida.
Huh?
Look, Ueno.
Sorry! I'll text you!
Ishida!
I figured things would work out if you met.
Nobody asked you.
Back in grade school,
That's why you'd obliviously hand over your stupid notebook,
and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
So how about we take it easy from now on?
Y-You're wrog.
In the end, things are the same as five years ago.
Did something happen between her and Nishimiya?
Huh? What do you mean?
Are you saying I'm going around telling people about the past?
Ch-Chill. You're being too loud.
Calm down, Kawai.
What're you talking about?
That can't be...
Sorry, Nagatsuka.
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
N-Nothing.
Still, Mashiba said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya.
Shut up, Sahara.
Keep your nose out of it, outsider.
Right.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
You think?
Er...
Wait, that's weird.
How do I look?
School, duh.
If I had to say, I'm in cosplay.
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
It does, or so I'd like to think.
Don't start talking like my grandma.
Do whatever you want.
I'll be fine from here.
Okay, Nishimiya?
Even monsters have hearts...
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
This is great!
Hey, Nishimiya.
Should I really be here?
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
Get out.
Oh, okay.
i1Yet so warm...
Oh, you can see him now.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a cancer, Nishimiya.
piss me off the most!
I'm sowwy...
I'm so sowwy!
She's holding it shut!
Mom?
Nishimiya...
Come on. Don't cry.
Oh, right.
Nishimiya,
Or everything after that, either.
If only I were gone...
I want to apologize to the others too.
We've reached your destination, sir.
Are you gonna die?!
They asked me not to tell you, but screw that.
Thanks for having me.
Moms!
Give her the jelly in the fridge.
Looks good.
I beg ya, boss!
Take care.
Nothing.
The one who was hospitalized?
What's with the moustache?
Thank you, Kawai.
Come on, you two.
Dumbass.
Let's check out the gym next.
I'm withdrawing everything.
What?
Oh...
Unbelievable...
Ok.
She's called Sho-chan, too.
Please write down what I say.
It's easier for Shoko-chan to use sign language.
I love him so much. He is so handsome.
What are you doing, Ishida ?
Aren't you surprised?
It's filthy!
What should I do...?
What?!
She said that eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have gone missing
Huh?
Your teacher gave me a call.
Be a good child from now on, okay?
Every time, you show that disgusting smile instead.
Oh, Shoko-chan. Hello.
Nishimiya!
Nishimiya.
Well...
And, here...
You said so in the past.
Dig in!
By the way, Sho-chan...
and the calendar on your wall...
I'm really sorry.
I'll stop. I'm sorry.
Really?
Hey, water, water!
Meeting Nishimiya beforehand was like a ceremony.
Thus, I was isolated.
Oh... Sorry, I forgot it.
Let's have lunch outside.
I'm so surprised.
Hey, why don't you lend your bike to me?
Oh, the guy I remember.
Stop it, please.
Hey, don't resist.
A big, creepy one.
Why?
Good timing!
I sit behind you in class.
Why don't we hang out after school?
Oh, no. They're fighting.
Stop it, ok?
Damn, she found and met him.
Wow, I didn't know that he had the skill.
Hey, you can read their sign language.
Translate it for me!
Tsk!
Be careful to not fall, boy.
"A kind of license to be friends with you."
"I've been looking for that these past two weeks."
Well..
For koi.
This guy.
"I am very sorry that I jumped into the Suimon River from a bridge,
Huh?
Hey...
I got it.
I'm relieved to hear that.
You should go home, too.
Maria, is it too hot?
Yuzuru-kun!
Please!
Dang...
What's wrong?
Here, an umbrella.
They were mine, but
I used Shoko's shampoo without asking...
You must've heard it all from Nishimiya.
I'm home.
Yu-ju,
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!
Someone whose address you want.
Don't joke around. I'm not that kind of girl.
But I really think that Kawai-san is quite clever.
Do you know how to contact
I have heard various news about you from Yuzuru.
Well...
Huh? Ishida-kun?
I continued studying sign language after that.
What's your cup size?
It's great that you learned sign language.
And thank you for bringing us together! It's great that you learned sign language.
How long are you going to stay?
Long time no see!
Actually,
Are you joking, Ishida?
Friends?
Well, I have to go now.
You must come.
Huh? A gift?
I lige moo!
"I said 'I like you' to Ishida-kun."
"But he misunderstood."
That's a good idea.
Everyone, let's start with that roller coaster!
Hey, why is that girl leading us?
Is she Shoko's friend?
Then let's start!
She's in my high school class.
Hey, are you ok?
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair all natural?
Here's your takoyaki. Have a nice day.
Ueno,
Shi... Shimada...
No, I'm not.
If Nishimiya-san hadn't come, we all would've been happy.
If she weren't there,
I didn't understand you well.
and always smiled so insincerely.
I... I'b zorry...
Our view was very narrow during childhood,
Mashiba-kun!
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...
What's wrong?
Hey, Ishida-kun, you're here!
Nao-chan...
But,
I just said the truth!
I hate that kind of logic.
Kawai, shut up.
Sorry, Ishida.
Yuzu.
but you don't care about yourself.
You study sign language and avoid senior groups.
This bread is
I'll go home now...
What's with your outfit?
If I had to say... cosplay?
You cried just now.
Why?
Yes it does...
I'm worried about Yuzuru.
Then I don't care if you follow me.
Coming here is enough.
"Funeral site for Ito Nishimiya"
I'm still a little bit scared.
Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow?
even a monster has
This is so funny!
How about tomorrow?
We can't go tomorrow, because we have something to do.
I see.
Then I'll go with you.
Nishimiya..!?
Grip the frame!
I'm very sorry.
Please.
You're totally useless!
It's so frustrating!
If you can't raise your child,
I'b zorry!
What are you doing?
She's holding it shut!
How about going to the lobby? I'll buy you a drink.
You tried to kill yourself even when you were hurt!
Everyone has, don't you think so?
you're visiting them at the bridge.
Yu bill jange brom now on,
I'm okay, too.
Just ago,
I want to apologize to everyone, too.
Forget what I did now!
Maybe I can't change...
Shimada and the others saved you.
Mom, I'll go to pick Maria up.
And look at this.
Shoko Nishimiya: Hello
Here is my class.
Hey, Ya-sho..?
Ishida-kun!!
This was a prayer for your recovery.
Kawai-san, you have something for Ishida-kun,
don't you?
Okay...
but I couldn't gather enough...
I asked everyone again and again, but..
I've never gotten anything like that before,
Oh... Ishida-kun.
I haven't changed, either.
You said sorry again!
Stu-pit!
Hey.
I want to go around the school festival with everyone.
Hey, the stall by Class B is really good!
We have a new classmate today.
Well,
Aha...
Nishimiya-san,
Then, from the start.
Nishimiya.
Isn't it amazing?
Sign... language...
So I propose a three-minute sign language lesson every morning
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?
Hirose, you write that side.
Hey, Ishida.
Okay! I'm sorry!
Well, what kind of house were they were living in. They lived..
Yeah, I thought the same thing, too.
Wh--What?
Let's go.
It's unbelievable!
It's about Nishimiya-san, who is absent today.
So please confess, before your parents are in trouble.
but Shouya didn't stop.
And the girls said bad things about her all the time.
Stop now, Shouya!
Have you been troubling someone?
Huh?
Dang it...
Huh?
I came to give this to you.
You left it behind.
Can we be
Shou-tan, wake up!
Why are you smiling so much?
and you sold everything, even your bed.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
I knew it...
I knew that something was going on!
You'll stop what, say it clearly!
I'll stop trying to kill myself!
He is...
"Ishida-kun is always so alone."
I'm home.
Oh.
But I don't want to use any money
Hey, why don't you lend your bike to me?
Someone, please help me!
Really? You're great!
and natural reason to see her again.
Where... was the bike?
Ishida-kun.
The bread, that is, not me.
It's good bread.
Are you satisfied?
Nagatsuka-kun, why are you here?
Good for you, Ishida-kun!
That's sign language.
Translate it for me!
She fell!
Ouch!
Why'd you do that?
"See you again"
I also uploaded that photo to the web..."
It's fine if you go quickly. Please!
Shou-tan!
Ouch!
Hey.
Why?
No, I can't.
Please!
Hey.
But...
But, actually,
It's an issue of myself, too...
Little sister?
Hey, let's go.
Shouko, the same goes for you.
Nagatsuka-kun, she's not a boy...
Nishimiya's little sister.
Nishimiya, do you have one?
Kawai-san...
Sahara-san, our elementary school classmate?
Don't worry, Ya-shou.
I'm sorry.
Hello! We handing out discount coupons!
Ueno...
Hmm?
Nee-chan?
Oh... I see.
Friends?
Then Ishida can see her.
Thanks.
What?
They're not candies.
but I'm not sure what they are.
"I said 'I like you' to Ishida-kun."
Hey, Kawai-san.
Okay.
Huh?
Everyone, let's start with that roller coaster!
Are you all ready?
Hey, are you ok?
Your legs are so trembling, Shou-chan.
Huh?
Hey, is this hand yours?
What are you doing?!
Ueno,
Shi... Shimada...
Are you angry?
We're quite alike, huh?
and we did our best within that limitation.
But I don't wanna ask you to be friends.
I still hate you,
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Hey, you speak too loud...
What are you saying, Kawai-san?
It's true.
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...
What's wrong?
At that time..
I was scared of both of you.
Ishida-kun, you were too bad.
That's just what I want to do.
What's with your outfit?
Why?
I really don't want you to.
Then I don't care if you follow me.
Coming here is enough.
Hold it, Yuzuru!
Ishida.
Come on, Nishimiya. Let's go far.
Nishimiya?
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy
Is that okay?
It might be even more. She may kill you.
You looks good with this!
She had no facial expressions, but..
June
I said "together"...
That's interesting.
Oh, what's up?
But...
Nishimiya, I'm here.
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
Give me just one more ounce of strength.
I won't escape from my challenges in life.
I'll do everything properly from now on...
It's cold...
Oh, everything's fine.
I'm sorry for troubling you like this.
My son must have done something wrong to Shouko-san.
Please raise your heads.
All that matters is that Shouko-chan is safe.
Say something!
Hey, Nishimiya.
I'b zorry.
I thought that these photos
So,
Nishimiya
Perhaps,
ju falld.
I want
live.
Welcome back!
Thank you.
Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?
Ishida-kun.
Oh, my...
What?
Nothing. I'm off.
So it's easier for me to look downward.
Thank you, Nishimiya.
I have a bit of a stomachache.
I would have lost everything.
at the bridge.
Nagatsuka-kun.
Stu-pid.
No, she's embarrassed.
Woah, it's delicious!
Elementary school grade 6 class 2
Oh...
"Hi, Nishimiya-san. I am Miki Kawai."
Aha...
From page 20 to page 25, and drills of page 32.
Hey.
Next, "the effort point", the point the strength is taken.
How should we do the coming chorus competition?
Crap. That's enough. Next.
Really? Unbelievable.
He will be in the drama next week. Must watch!
Don't interrupt.
If any of you know anything about bullying
I'm very sorry.
Thank you for calling.
Shoya.
Shoya.
Shut up, Jumped in the river like always.
Huh?
What?
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?
Same smile again.
What?
Doigg mah bezd...
Shoya Ishida.
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Let's eat.
I knew it!
to kill myself by jumping into a river from some very high bridge.
When just entered junior high school, Shimada said;
that I had to owe the responsibility of what I had did.
And I was isolated.
Let's have a lunch outside.
can I meet Nishimiya again?
I burned money you earned hard.
Tuesday.
Someone please help me!
Stop resisting!
Reason.
This is so good, Nagatsuka-kun.
Ishida-kun!
Give me your hand.
I think, Ishida-kun,
She is, isn't she?
Oops! ... Dropped.
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!
Nagatsuka-kun
Ishida-kun is waving his hands and doing something!?
Who was that turd-hair just now?
"A kind of license to be friends with you"
Nishimiya...
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?
where it was prohibited to do so, and..
Shoes?
Be mad with me.
Originally I am to be blamed.
Haha, you have a kid.
How about sis?
Maria, isn't it too hot?
Well, excuse me.
I won't use them anymore. I'll give you.
Use your umbrella for you.
Hey you.
I see.
Thanks, it's enough here.
But actually I'm Shoko's...
Hey, sis!
Why are you here today?
Well..
Sahara-san? a classmate of the elementary school?
Don't be joking. I'm not such a girl.
Kawai-san...?
But I know her school,
My sis says
So take her with you, Ishida.
Sho-chan!
Do you remember me?
Hehehe.
Long time no see.
I'm sorry.
Hum, hum...
I cannot behave like her...
I think so, too.
Oh, unbelievable. He actually comes...
So did you.
No no. Don't be stupid.
Is she here?
Hi, you come here.
Go, go!
I gave it to her.
H..hey!!
Ueno! What are you doing!?
I cannot follow you!
Now I don't stop you two playing friends!
So many carp. Feeding manpower and bread shorted.
Huh? You give this?
but I'm not sure what are these.
Huh, what did sis tried to tell?
If you want to know if sis is avoiding you or not,
why don't you invite her playing something?
Ueno.. Why..
Sahara-san are you ok to be with Ueno?
Huh?
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.
Angry -- No.
We are alike.
Hi, you are welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
I got a highly confidential movie.
Let's not use it.
I'll speak clearly so that you can understand
and I'll listen what you say.
That's why you bothered me with weird notebook
But I don't wanna say you let's be friends now.
You say "I'm sorry" again!?
You have always told me cruel things since elementary school!
I never said bad words to Nishimiya-san!
He scared me so much..
Ya-sho?
Huh?
originally you are to blamed, I think.
we can forgive him,
That's not proper way.
Nao-chan..
Don't conclude everything by yourself.
You simply like yourself the most.
Sho-chan,
from next week,
That's just what I myself want to do.
Yes, of course!
Huh...?
Hummm, this message is not good.
Nothing.
Why?
Don't say what my grandma would say.
Oh, it's splendid.
What? Why you say sorry now?
Then let's go to see a movie!
Hahaha, how funny it is!
It's really full of happiness.
How about tomorrow?
I---is that ok?
Good job, sis!
"Study"..
Nishimiya, I'm here.
Why..
Grip the frame!
Please, God..
Sho-chan,
Hi, ma'am.
I owe all the responsibility of mismanagement.
Why in the world does Ishida have to be injured!
"I am very sorry." ??
How hubris you are!
I'b zorry.
I'b zorry!
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun created working so hard."
Actually, Ya-sho accepted a trivial guy like me.
Ya-sho is my "big friend",
Nishimiya.
Strange, isn't it?
Get rid of this!
you are ok.
Please stop to make such a serious face.
But my selfish behavior had hurt you,
Don't cry, Nishimiya.
I talked to you in my dreams.
In the dream,
Oops!
You are great!
You have resumed to go to school, haven't you?
Huh? It's ok to look downward?
Sorry.
Nagatsuka---kun?
Don't be mind any more
So, Ya-sho, please please,
Pleeeease!
Nagatsuka-kun.
As we have heard Nagatsuka-kun's calling Ishida-kun's name.
Kawai-san. you have the you-know-what to give him,
and I am really happy.
Oh? Kawai-tchi?
Don't say so.
Hey, we don't talk nothing negative or serious now!.
You gave me special time even when my heart had been broken

Class 6-2
You think I care?
Levers fall under three classes based on their locations.
Nishimiya.
I was distracted for half the class again.
Forget it. Next.
Nishimiya.
Are you kidding me?
Could you tell me what you were talking about?
How does this sound?
Ta...
Really? I think it's just right.
We're in the middle of class.
Let's go.
Later, Shoya.
Yes, sir!
Why would you say that?
Was it true, what your teacher said?
Get ready.
Mizuho Bank
Be a good boy from tomorrow.
They were called "aliens," and they had a really hard time.
and it pisses me off!
Come on, out with it!
Shoya Ishida.
Though you might not want to see it.
Eat up.
I'm truly sorry!
Hey, Mom!
i1I found myself all alone.
All right, then.
Yes?
Kawai.
Better get on that, then.
i1"Oh, he's looking this way again.
i1Doesn't he get lonely, being all alone all the time?
i1Who was he, again?
i1She said she'd be there every Tuesday.
You gave me a start.
Take your time.
i1Who, me?
Huh? For what?
Let go!
You're a god.
Fluffy New Bread Discount Coupon Miss Baguette
I-Is Nishimiya here?
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.
And that is what friends are.
Wow, that's kinda unexpected.
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
Quit being an ass and bring her out!
Isn't that Yuzuru?
Hmm?
Interpret for me!
"Don't know him at all."
And do it right!
I was searching for a reason to meet you."
"I'm so glad.
Did something happen to Ishida?!
What the heck? Isn't that Ishida?
Is she really okay with it?
Come on, you can go for a bit.
Someone's inside!
You'll catch a cold.
What the heck?
Yell at me, dude.
I'll be going, then.
Ow!
Aren't you eating, Yuzuru?
Say "aah"!
Thanks.
What the heck?
Oh, right.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
Nagatsuka, that's not a "laddy."
I see. I could tell you...
I think you're really responsible, though.
What is it?
I brought her.
Are you tired? Yuzuru gave me your number. Thanks for doing this.
I was really happy when I heard you found Sahara!
I've kept studying sign language.
I'm really glad to see you again.
What a pleasant surprise.
Ueno?
Yeah, I agree.
Right. Your friend...
Go, go!
Seriously, Ishida. It's been ages.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Gotcha.
How have you been?
We're friends.
It's fine, really.
Thanks.
You look great!
Oh.
The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
Is she avoiding me?
Why?
Follow me, and don't fall behind!
I'm kinda scared.
Here we go, then!
You know sign language?
Ishida!
I figured things would work out if you met.
You and I are alike.
I want to back to how things were before she came.
Nishimiya, ride the Ferris wheel with me.
Wait, Ueno.
Yeah.
Listen.
So I changed my approach.
So how about we take it easy from now on?
So what?
You haven't changed one bit.
What are you saying, Kawai?
It's true!
You badmouthed her yourself.
Yasho?
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
Sorry about earlier.
What right do we have to criticize Ishida over it?
Neither of you!
Enough.
All you've ever cared about is yourself.
Yasho...
It doesn't bother me.
Then I'm doing it for myself too.
Heya.
Nothing.
Don't start talking like my grandma.
I'm still scared.
Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
Not tomorrow. We have plans.
That looks great!
What are you trying to pull?
Thanks.
I couldn't tell from her poker face.
June 7th?
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
Oh, is that so?
Nishimiya!
Why...
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
i1Did I ever actually apologize to her?
Your sister made pancakes.
Auntie, he saved my stupid sister.
Who the hell do you think you are?
And who the hell are you?!
Are you Shoko?
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
Yasho accepted a weirdo like me.
Mom?
Come on. Don't cry.
I'm sorry.
We've reached your destination, sir.
Maria, Sho came back to life.
Go thank her.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no...
Moms!
I'll go pick up Maria.
Are you serious? That's crazy...
M-Morning, guys.
How've you been?
Morning.
So I feel much better when I look down.
I can keep looking down?
It's Ishida!
How're you doing?
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
Thank you, Kawai.
You apologized again.
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
Listen up.
Watch your mouth, Nao-chan.
First up, the fulcrum. It's the point that supports the lever.
Are you kidding me?
Isn't writing in her notebook good enough?
Mi...
Sa.
Hirose, take that side.
Stop that.
Ishida, you're going too far.
Yikes, who did this?
You overdid it, man.
What? Move.
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.
You're awful...
Yes, I understand.
Shoya!
Wait, why are you soaking wet?
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!
and it pisses me off!
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
Nishimiya!
Could we be friends?
Sho-tan!
Morning, Maria.
I won't do it!
Ow!
Yes?
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
i1Will he spend his whole life like that?
i1Would that be creepy?
Hey, could you let me borrow your bike?
Stop it.
Um...
She's not here.
Excuse me for asking,
There was just a rat out there.
Look at this! Look at this!
Good timing!
I sit behind you, you know.
Ishida-kun!
It's nothing.kametsu: N-Nothing
You see, Ishida-kun...
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
Oh no, they're fighting.
Nagatsuka-kun!
Ishida-kun's waving his hands around.
Wow.
Oh, okay.
Nishimiya.
Nishimiya!
Huh? What's this?
Someone's inside!
Where are your shoes?
What the heck?
I had it coming.
Hey!
Said she'd be late tonight.
Damn it...
What are you doing?
Thanks.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
She told me go away.
I'm back.
Nee-chan, you'll get wet.
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
Wow, laddy.
Wow, nice.
Yasho?
What is it?
Huh?
I've kept studying sign language.
I left all of a sudden...
By the way, your chest has gotten bigger.
Meow Meow Club?
Whoa, Sahara's amazing.
an8Seriously?
Huh? What about you?kametsu: A-And what about you?
Don't be stupid.
Bug!
I came to play with Maria.
Hey!kametsu: H-Hey!
Huh?
Huh? Hang on a sec.
Nah.
See you.
Id monig.
Wait, wait. Before that...
Nishimifscx150
She's sporting a ponytail?
Do I dalk weerd?
What the heck are these?
Don't go over my head!
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
She was trying her best to tell me something the other day, and I couldn't get it.
It's such a simple word, but I couldn't understand it.
She's acting awfully friendly.
Hey! What's with your hand?
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
i1But this feels kinda like...
Don't just assume that.Kametsu: We don't know that.
Take this with you, Nee-chan.
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
i1Listen.
i1Let's not.
i1I ignored you and badmouthed you.
i1So what?
i1Are you going to apologize again?
Oh, uh...
Wait, is that why she was bullied?
That's right! Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san!
Got what wrong?
I was only telling the truth!
What? Whose side are you on?
Oh, buzz off. You don't know the first thing about me.
Sho-chan.
So...
If I had to say, I'm in cosplay.
Why?
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
And why is that?
i1was me.
Hey, Nishimiya!
Hey, Nishimiya.
What are you making?
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
That looks great!2 Speakers
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
I see...
Whoa, it's dark.
Let go together. Come see him.kametsu: Come with me. Let him see your face. No English person would say this.
I was too negligent.
Please, I beg you.
Why did Ishida have to get hurt?!
What are you doing?
He made me realize for the first time what a best friend was.
I failed to protect you again!
What's all this?
Nishimiya.
Nishimiya...
I'm sorry.
Oh,
She nursed you the entire time, you know.
I'm a really awful person.
Welcome back.
Yes?
Hey.
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
Good luck!kametsu: Take care.
Shall we?
The one who was hospitalized?
I can keep looking down?
I can walk just fine.
Yasho!
Nagatsuka-kun...
I'm sorry about everything.
Also, thank you.
Dumb-ass.
Dumb-ass.
She ran away.
Isn't it amazing?
How mean.
What do we do?
Ishida...
Stand up already!
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
Well, I did tell him to stop.
But Shoya didn't listen.
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
You're so mean, Ishida!
Yes, of course!
That look again?
What's with you?
What?
And who was on flower duty?
Hello there, Shoko.
Hey.
Uh...
I came to give this back.
Don't cry.
Goodbye, Mommy.
Here you go, Sho.
You even sold off your manga, clothes, and bed.
By the way, Sho...
If you don't promise not to kill yourself, I'll burn this up.
Oh...
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
I won't kill myself!
It's a promise, okay?
i1At our middle school entrance ceremony, I overheard Shimada say...
i1I realized that your sins always come back to bite you,
Seriously?
i1I bought this on release day.
Oh, there is!Referring to the blimp 'oh, there is a blimp' or something like that. kametsu: "That's true!" doesn't fit here.
For burning all that money you earned.
Starving!
Um...
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
She's right there.
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.
Excuse me for asking,
but are you really friends with her?
Oh, there he is.
What's your name?
Makes us seem like big friends, right?buddies  best buddies
And requirements can kiss my ass.
Well, that sucks.
So, huh...
Stop it.
Who was that turd-head?
I've spent the past two weeks thinking about what friendship means.
I was searching for a reason to meet you.
She jumped in.Literally: fell. Presumably, she saw everything, so "jumped in" makes more sense but there are solid arguments for going with the more literal...
Serves you right, jerk.
Ishida, come to the staff room.
and then uploaded a photo of it to the internet...
Someone's inside!
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?
What are you doing, in a place like this?
Eat up.
Aren't you eating, Yuzuru?
Say aah!
That scared me. You suddenly vanished.
Thanks.
Wanna wear these?
I had a fight with Shoko.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
I used her shampoo without asking her.
Her not being able to hear was something amusing for you, right?Alt: "Her not being able to hear gave you some kicks, right?" kametsu: "You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?"
What the heck?
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Later.
Yuduwu!
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
What is it?
Don't worry about it, Yasho.
Huh? Ishida?
Really?
We're giving out discount coupons!
i1What? Not happening.
All right.
Welcome!
an8Seriously?
Crap. He really came.
I'm only here to meet your friend. No dirty thoughts whatsoever.
I don't see her around.
Oh, you're here?
Isn't that Nishimiya?
Not really.
We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.
Of course not.
What a weird face.
Ishida needs to see this.
Hang on, Nishimiya.
Do I dalk weerd?
Something happen?
Is she avoiding me?
What's with her?
Someone Shoko knows?
Sure. Go ahead.
You know sign language?
Wait.
You and I are alike.
Hey.
Hey!
i1and I'll pay attention to what you're saying.
i1That's why you'd obliviously hand over your stupid notebook,
i1and you hate me.
Nishimiya?
I hate that line of thinking.
All you've ever cared about is yourself.
Your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
Is that so?
This bread...
So...
Huh?
Ishida.
Um...
Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.
I wanna see the ocean.
Shall we go watch a movie?
This is great!
What are you trying to pull?
Nishimiya?
I'm coming in.
Nishimiya?
i1From tomorrow,
i1Are you still mad?
i1By the way, Nishimiya.
Oh, Yuzuru.
Nishimiya?
Please raise your head.
Are you her mother?!
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya.
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
She won't hear me unless I yell!
I'm still the same old coward.
Nishimiya...
Nishimiya,
I'm all good now.
Oh, right.
Id all my fauld!
I'm so sowwy!
I'd felt the same way as you forever,
Welcome back.
This suits you much better.
Oh, welcome back, Sho.
Yuzu's upstairs.
Wow, are you serious? That's crazy.
Sure.
Morning.
Shall we?
I can't look at people's faces.
So I feel much better when I look down.
Nishimiya...
Yasho!
Yasho?
Nagatsuka...
It's fine. Hand them over.
I've never got anything like this before,
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
It's a girl.
Here's your punishment for being a lame-o.
Ow, that hurts.
I was distracted for half the class again.
Next, Ishida.
You know,
Sa.
Looking good!
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
What is that?
She's crazy.
It's about Nishimiya Shoko, who's absent today.
Yes, sir!
Well, I did tell him to stop.
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
Yeah, it's true!
Let's go home, Sho.
They were called aliens, and they had a really hard time.
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing to my desk?
What were you doing, you creep?!
Um, remember me?kametsu: U-Uh...
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
Nishimiya!
Oh.
What am I saying?
Sho!
So I was right!
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
Better get on that, then.
i1He's famous for it. Everyone knows.
Seriously?
Sorry.
i1Tuesday...
i1an8Oh, it's that guy.
What? What the heck?
Anybody!
You can take mine.
A super creepy one.
Where did you find it?
What's wrong, Ishida?
Let's go hang out after school today.
To mark the start of our friendship.
We're best friends.
What are friends, anyway?Borderline keyframe snap. I think it looks better snapped as there's plenty of time to read this short line, but it comes down to personal preference.
Hold out your hand.
How stupid.
She's right there.
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.
Are we done here?
Hey, laddy!
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
I dare you to say that again!
Turd-head, turd-head, turd-head!
Come on, Nagatsuka.Keyframe snap looks worse to me
Let me see!
Is feeding them fun?
Did something happen to Ishida?!
W-What was that for?
Sorry, but could you go pick up Maria?
What are you doing, in a place like this?
About what?
Yell at me, dude.
I'm hungry!
You have a daughter?
She told me go away.
We only have the one, right?
Oh.
Of course Nishimiya's told you.
But at the very least, I don't want to make Nishimiya cry any more.
Okay.
but I'm Shoko's...
Hey, you're hurting me.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
What brings you here today?
You're pretty responsible.
I got a cellphone.Hesitation earlier but barely audible
Sahara?
I'm really glad to see you again.
We're giving out discount coupons!
Onward to Meow Meow Club!
O-One hour, please.
Is she here?
I came to play with Maria.
Cat!
Long time no see, Nishimiya!
What are you doing, Ueno?
No way.
Are you two going out?
What we were talking about?In context this is fine, otherwise: What were we talking about?
Id monig.
What's up?
Nishimifscx150
Thank you.
Say, Nagatsuka.
Really? But it looks nice.
Don't go over my head!
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
You're being rude to my Yasho!
Hey!
Hey, what're youfscx150
i1You know, like a group of friends!
Ishida!
i1I hate you.
i1and have a stupid smile on your face all the time.
Chill. You're being too loud.
That's right! Ishida bullied Nishimiya!
Yasho!
I brought your bag.
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
I was only telling the truth!
You're just gonna run and regret it again, since you're a coward.
Sorry, Ishida.
Ishida, you're too awful.
All you care about is your sister.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
I got some really nice bread today.
It's good, like you.
Huh?
Guess I'll go home.
Seriously, what's up?
You don't have to.
Let me.
And why is that?
Don't start talking like my grandma.
Do whatever you want.
Later.
Right, Yuzuru?
What?
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
Whoa!2 Speakers
What's the big deal? It's a happy occasion.
Yum!
Oh, right.
Nah, I'll pass.
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.
What's up?
That reminds me, Ishida.
W-Wait a second.
i1Yet so warm...
I called the shop, but nobody answered.
They moved him to a ward room today.
Nishimiya?
I'm just glad Shoko's all right.
And who the hell are you?!
Are you her mother?!
Soww...
I'm sowwy...
What was I supposed to do?
She won't hear me unless I yell!
We were so worried!
But we're all in the same boat, aren't we?
I see.
What's all this?
Nishimiya.
Oh, welcome back, Sho.
Yes?
Well, I'll give it my best shot.
Good luck!kametsu: Take care.
The other dayfscx150
Hey, Yasho.
Also, thank you.
You're making my skin crawl.
I'm sorry.
Dumb-ass.
Oh, forget it.
Thank you for everything.
Take your seats, class.
It's a girl.
Okay, introduce yourself.
Then there's the effort which is the force that's applied at one point.
Nishimiya-san.
Nishimiya-san!
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
Er...
And Shimada?
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
Huh?!
Was it true, what your teacher said?
Huh?
I'm dryig...
I'm dryig, ju no!
She really pisses me off.
Nishimiya!
From sixth grade.
Though you might not want to see it.
Hey...
i1Sho-tan!
Oh...
I mean it!
i1Doesn't he get lonely, being all alone all the time?
i1Who was he, again?
i1She said she'd be there every Tuesday.
Sorry about this morning.
Stop it.
Hey, knock it off.
Somebody help!
an8Crap!
i1I need an excuse...
Say, Nagatsuka-kun...
And that is what friends are.
It's good bread.
Goodbye.
Excuse me? What's your problem?
My, if it isn't the boy from the other day.
No, you're wrong...
What?
Wow.
Don't fall, laddy.
Ishida-kun...
I was thinking the same thing.
Ew, what is this?
Shoko's such a fool.
Hey...
Sho-tan!
I was the one who tweeted that pic of you.
I had it coming.
Sho-tan!
Aren't you eating, Yuzuru-kun?
Here, umbrella.
And now you've learned sign language?
But this also concerns me.
Hey, you're hurting me.
I'm sorry too.
What brings you here today?
She's Nishimiya's little sister.
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?
Um,
Huh?
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
Hey.
I've been worried about you ever since.
Huh...
Okay, got it.
Please visit!
Should I keep going and have Ueno meet Nishimiya too?
O-One hour, please.
Well, you know...
I don't see her around.
Cat!
I'll leave your gift here.kametsu: "Gift for you. I'll leave it here." This sounds a bit unnatural.
Oh.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Oh, really?
Sorry, Nishimiya.
No way.
See you.
You have your hair in a ponytail today.
Wait. Use sign language.
Kinda.
Nishimiya?
The moon?kametsu: Love the moon?
Something happen?
You look great!
Oh, that would've really annoyed her.
Follow me, and don't fall behind!
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida-kun.
Huh?
It's all on me.
Hey.
What? How?
i1I'll talk slowly so you can understand,
Did something happen between her and Nishimiya-san?
Calm down, Kawai-san.
What're you talking about?
It was so scary.
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun.
Oh, Ishida.
Got what wrong?
Yeah, I'm not.
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
Ueno.
What's gotten into you, Ishida-kun?
Keep your nose out of it, outsider.
Are you still worried about your sister?
Meanwhile, I'm worried about you.
All you care about is your sister.
Then I'm doing it for myself too.
School, duh.
Seriously, what's up?
Let me.
Hang in there, Yuzuru.
I'm still scared.
Nishimiya, let's go check it out.
Okay, Nishimiya?
Shall we go watch a movie?
I'm really enjoying my time, seriously.
We should totally go somewhere.
What?!
Won't I get slapped again?
What are you trying to pull?
Will this spot be okay?Alt's: spot do?; spot work?
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
But...
All right.
What are you doing?
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
i1I'm sorry, Nishimiya.
i1You see, I...
i1Your sister made pancakes.
i1So cold...
People like you, who can only see things from their own point of view,
Soww...
I'm so sowwy!
I used to think Nee-chan would stop talking about wanting to die if she saw these.
She's holding it shut!
You gan jange from now,
What is all this?!
More or less.
I wanted to talk to you more.
No!
You fell becas I couldn jange!
It looked like I was trying to give up on everything.
Oh, Maria. You're watering the flowers?
isn't that Ueno-san?
I hear you came to visit.
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya-san.
Gosh. You've cut it too short!
Oh, welcome back, Sho-chan.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
I beg ya, boss!
M-Morning, guys.
I can't look at people's faces.
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
Those things happen in life.
Also, thank you.
Oh, forget it.
I'd like us to check out the festival together.
How can he come to school?
Thank you for everything.
I give up! I'm tapping out!
These will be on the upcoming quiz.
Gimme your notebook.
All right.
Frens?
What?
You're such a creep!
Right?
You bad boy.
Yikes, who did this?
Nishimiya, are you all right?
Well, I did tell him to stop.
Right?
He made her cry...
Hold it, Shoya!
I'm dryig...
I don't get it!
You forgot this.
Anyway, here.
i1It was the biggest test of courage in my life.
i1I realized that your sins always come back to bite you,
I will, sorry.
Wanna go to the courtyard?
i1Ishida's always by himself, huh?
Seriously?
i1Oh, he's looking this way again.
Figures.
What is it?
Can't you just take your own bike?
I'm asking you because I don't have one!
Let go!
Huh? For real?
This is it!
Excuse me for asking,
What?
I'm glad it had your address on it.
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.
I'm Nagatsuka.
Ishida.
Say, Nagatsuka...
She's not.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
Forget it. Let's go.
I never knew he had that skill.
Wait, you know sign language?
Interpret for me!
W-What was that for?
Ew, what is this?
Did you see this?
Hey...
Oh, it's the rat.
I was the one who tweeted that pic of you.
Hey!
Here, Yuzuru.
Here, umbrella.
Seriously.
I used her shampoo without asking her.
We only have the one, right?
Later.
Hey, you're hurting me.
I'm sorry too.
Hey, laddy.
You have one too, right?
Is there anyone else you'd like to text?
Sa... ha... ra?
Sahara, from grade school?
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
Crap. I'm running low on cash.
You'd feel a lot better if you had this much.
Huh? Ishida?
I've kept studying sign language.
I've been worried about you ever since.
I'm really glad to see you again.
What's your cup size?
Let me check!
We're giving out discount coupons!
Welcome!
an8Seriously?
Well, you know...
A lot happened in sixth grade.
Oh, do you think Nishimiya would like this?
Go, go!
You hate me, don't you?
I gave it to her.
Well, have fun playing friends.
What we were talking about?In context this is fine, otherwise: What were we talking about?
Sis...
Yuzuru asked me to buy some bread for the carp.
Hang on, Nishimiya.
Thank you.
Can I open it?
The moon? Not really, no.
Seriously, what the heck are these?
I was just running short on time.
Why, you ask?
No special reason, really.
Someone Shoko knows?
Here we go, then!
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida.
Don't touch me!
i1But this feels kinda like...
Let's go buy some.
Sorry! I'll text you!
You and I are alike.
Yes, we are.
But it's the truth, isn't it?Kametsu: But I do.
i1I hate you.
i1I had no understanding of you or your situation.
i1I hade mysel.
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
Don't lump me in with you.
Mean!
Out with it, Sahara.
I hate that line of thinking.
You don't have to put it like that.
Ishida, you're too awful.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
Then I'm doing it for myself too.
Hey, Yuzufscx150
It's a uniform, obviously.
How do I look?
Seriously, what's up?
That scared me.
Of course not!
Even monsters have hearts...
Should I really be here?
What?!
You look good.
We did it, Sis.
I picked a photo and submitted it to the prefectural photography contest.
All right.
See you.
Nishimiya?
Oh, she is here.
Ma'am, he saved my stupid sister.
Please...
You too, Yuzuru.
Stop it!
What is wrong with you two?
I'm so sowwy!
Tahada...
Nishimiya...
I'm all good now.
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Listen, Nishimiya.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
We've reached your destination, sir.
Atta girl.
But you died! You died!Originally had: "You're back! You're back!" Literally: died! Alt: You're alive! You're alive!
Guess I don't have to.
Wow, are you serious? That's crazy.
I beg ya, boss!
M-Morning, guys.
I can walk just fine.
Yasho?
Nagatsuka...
I actually wanted to make a thousand of these, but I couldn't.
This is plenty!
I've never got anything like this before,
Thank you, Kawai.
Why do you have to be like that?
I'm the same.
Dumb-ass.
So?
Then there's the effort which is the force that's applied at one point.
Are you kidding me?
What?
What?
Have you all heard of sign language?
And it's much easier for me to write.
Hirose, take that side.
Who cares?
Looking good!
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
That four-eyes really pisses me off.
He might've messed with her from time to time.
And Shimada?
Yes, I understand.
Hold it, Shoya!
Your teacher told me everything.
Hold on!
Yeah, it's true!
Huh?
What?
Uh...
Wait, she was saying the same thing back in grade school.
I finally understand what she meant.
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Sho, wake up!
So I was right!
Uh... I'm sorry!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
What have I done?
i1And then...
All right, then.
i1Same.
Sorry about this morning.
i1Tuesday...
Huh? For what?
You can take mine.
This is it!
She's not.
Nothing.
Friends...
Look at this! Look at this!
Where did you find it?
Ishida!
Ishida!
To mark the start of our friendship.
Is something wrong, Yasho?
Feel free to tell me.
We're best friends.
You see, Ishida...
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
Why, you...
Ishida's waving his hands around.
Wait, you know sign language?
Ishida...
Why?!
See you again...
This is you, right?
and then uploaded a photo of it to the internet...
Someone's inside!
Where are your shoes?
Hey!
Oh, Yuzuru.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
Yeah, that's right.
but I'm Shoko's...
Yuduwu!
both Sis and me.
This is my friend Nagatsuka.
I got a cellphone.Hesitation earlier but barely audible
You have one too, right?
D-Do you text your friends and stuff?
I see. I could tell you...
What?
Yasho, Yasho.
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
I think you're really responsible, though.
Sahara?
I brought her.
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
It's me, Sahara!
Huh? Ishida?
Long time no see, huh?
What's your cup size?
i1What? Not happening.
an8Seriously?
Don't be stupid.
Bug!
I'm coming in, Sis!
Sorry about grade school.
Ueno?
Long time no see, Nishimiya!
Hey!
No way.
We're friends.
Nah.
What's up?
Nishimiya?
These?
Did something happen?
I was just running short on time.
What?
Don't go over my head!
Why?
Ueno? Why?
Can I sit with you, Sahara?
Here it comes.
Here's your takoyaki.
Sorry! I'll text you!
Nishimiya, ride the Ferris wheel with me.
Wait, Ueno.
i1Listen.
i1Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.
i1So how about we take it easy from now on?
What about her?
You haven't changed one bit.
Mashiba, Ishida once bullied a girl.
What are you saying, Kawai?
Nishimiya?
Out with it, Sahara.
Grandma...
Huh?
Hey, Yuzufscx150
You don't have to.
Why?
I'm still scared.
Oh, wow!
I'm here.
Man, best summer break ever!
Right, Yuzuru?
Where are we going tomorrow?
What?
What are you making?
So you're already eighteen, huh?
All right.
Huh?
i1Sho.
i1Yet so warm...
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
She's holding it shut!
Kawai, you're being too loud.
I'm glad you're all right.
I couldn't change.
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
That was probably all.
I was talking to you before coming here.
I'd felt the same way as you forever,
Oh, Maria. You're watering the flowers?
Maria, Sho came back to life.
Go thank her.
Yes?
Oh, no...
Winter uniform?
I wanna live up to her expectations.
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
Is the water ready?
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
Yasho, why are you looking down?
Those things happen in life.
Don't go anywhere!
Nagatsuka...
Sorry...
I'm the same.
She ran away.
She was too embarrassed.
God, this is seriously yummy!
Hey, can you speak Japanese?
Gimme your notebook.
Once more, from the top.
Y'know...
Start from here.
an8Sign language...
What are you doing, Ishida?
Lemme see.
What do we do?
Shoya's all red!
Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.
He made her cry...
Shoya.
Shoya!
That look again?
What are you saying?!
And who was on flower duty?
Though you might not want to see it.
I mean...
But, uh, I won't...
i1At our middle school entrance ceremony, I overheard Shimada say...
You guys better stay away from that Ishida Shoya.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Ishida Shoya.  italics?
All right, then.
i1I bought this on release day.
Sho-chan...
I'll earn it again.
Huh? For what?
i1an8Oh, it's that guy.
I forgot something.
i1And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.
i1It's not like I can't walk there,
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.
Morning.
Hold out your hand.
Nishimiya likes younger boys?
Look.
I followed you.
Wow.
Let go.
Ishida-kun...
I'm so glad.
Funny, right?
an8Shoya!
Hey!
She's my sister's!
Is it too hot, Maria?
Oh, Yuzuru-kun.
Damn it...
Wanna wear these?
Why'd you run away from home?
You're disgusting.
I'm a terrible human being.
I have no right to live.
How are you doing?
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?
I see. I could tell you...
It's me, Sahara!
Hey.
I've been worried about you ever since.
I'm only here to meet your friend. No dirty thoughts whatsoever.
Nee-chanSis?
We're friends.
I'll get going, then.
Why...?
Hang on, Nishimiya.
Kinda.
Thank you.
These?
Love the moon?
N-Nishimiya?
Why'd you change your hairstyle?
Ishida.
From grade school.
Though I am still terrified.
Oh, no, not good!
Your legs are shaking, Sho-chan.kametsu: Your legs are all wobbly, Sho.
I'm not.
I figured things would work out if you met.
Didn't I do the exact same thing?
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
i1I hate you.
i1Y-You're wrog.
Oh, uh...
Did something happen between her and Nishimiya-san?
Huh? Why do you ask?
Are you saying I'm going around telling people about the past?
Ch-Chill. You're being too loud.
Mishiba-kun, Ishida-kun once bullied a girl.
Got what wrong?
Don't lump me in with you.
Nao-chan badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara-san!
Yasho...
Keep your nose out of it, outsider.
Right.
Here.
Are you still worried about your sister?
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
What the heck?
It's a uniform, obviously.
If I had to say, I'm in cosplay.
I'll walk you. Where to?
You don't have to.
Why?
i1This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
Where are we going tomorrow?
We should totally go somewhere.
What?
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
Hey...
Y-Yeah.
Who asked you two?
Will this spot be okay?Alt's: spot do?; spot work?
Come with me, Mom.
Then it's already passed!
I see...
You need to study?
Could you go get my camera for me?
Whoa, it's dark.
Nishimiya?
Why...
Why, Nishimiya?
N-Nishifscx150
i1Sho-chan.
I called the shop, but nobody answered.
Uh, I'm very sorry.
You're a cancer, Nishimiya.
And who the hell are you?!
Why?
I'm glad you're all right.
I couldn't change.
I failed to protect you again!
More or less.
I'm sorry.
It was within a dream.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
Did I just do something really creepy?
Oh, Maria. You're watering the flowers?
Gosh. You've cut it too short!
Ishida-kun.
That's right. My son is invincible.
Hey.
Yeah, you heard right.
What?
Yasho...
I'm so glad you're all right!
Oh.
I brought them, but I can't give him those. They came out really badly.
Sorry...
What's your problem, Kawai? You wanna go?
How can he come to school?
Hey, Class B's stall is seriously great.
I give up! I'm tapping out!
Huh?
Same as Ishida, then.
What? Not nice.
Okay, note down the following sections.
First up, the fulcrum. It's the point that supports the lever.
Start from here.
Are you kidding me?
You know...
Frens...
What?
You're gross!
Isn't it amazing?
Right?
Don't say that, Nao!
Ishida, you're going too far.
Where were we, again...
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.
Look, we all know it was you.
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
Yes, of course!
Shoya.
Don't ask me.
Get ready.
I'm dryig, ju no!
She really pisses me off...
I didn't get the log.
Hey.
I came to give this back.
Hey...
Could we be friends?
Sho's up!
By the way, Sho...
Why'd you want to kill yourself?
You guys better stay away from that Ishida Shoya.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Ishida Shoya.  italics?
Seriously?
i1S-Say...
i1I bought this on release day.
For burning all that money you earned.
I'll earn it again.
i1Who, me?
I forgot something.
Anybody!
Keep it down, man!
Uh...
Nishimiya Shoko isn't here.
Goodbye.
Friends...
I'm Nagatsuka.
You know, does one need to fulfill any requirements to be a friend?
Hold out your hand.
How stupid.
Uh, who arefscx150
Oh, no.
an8Take it back!
Oh, crap!
What a creep!
Funny, right?
Ishida jumped into the river?!
Serves you right, jerk.
Thanks.
Time to go home, Maria.
Boy, am I ever glad it was you.
What the heck?
Here, umbrella.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
I used her shampoo without asking her.
She told me go away.
Man...
I know you made fun...
And now you've learned sign language?
Okay.
Oh, right.
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...
Hey, you're hurting me.
Tell Shoko, too.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
Is there anyone else you'd like to text?
Kawai...?
But Mashiba...
Kawai.
You'll need to pay for travel, food, and a love hotel.
Huh?
Huh? Ishida?
Long time no see, huh?
Meow Meow Club?
Welcome!
Things are pretty awkward right now.
The poor thing.
I gave it to her.
H-Hey!
We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.
Ishida, where are you goig?
I-I need to go buy the bread.
What?
I lub moo!more like like but I guess this works
It is very pretty today.
Something happen?
Nice to meet you. I'm Sahara.
What did she say?
They're such simple words, but I couldn't understand them.
Let's line up for that one first, everyone!
She's acting awfully friendly.
Can I sit with you, Sahara?
Yeah!2 Speakers
Oh, yeah.
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.
Is your hair natural?
i1Is this really okay...
What are you doing?
Let's go buy some.
You and I are alike.
i1But you never tried to understand me, either.
i1You went crying to the adults.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1What the heck?
Nishimiya really can't hear, huh?
Yeah.
i1Yeah, I hate myself, too.
Oh, Ishida.
Hey.
Something wrong?
Heya.
Unlike me, you went out of your way to bully Nishimiya.
Nao badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara!
I hate that line of thinking.
Not another word, Kawai.
Sorry, Ishida.
All you care about is your sister.
Like you're any better.
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
Your heart is pure.
It's good, like you.
Heya.
Do whatever you want.
That scared me.
Of course not!
Say, let's hang out tomorrow, too.
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
We should totally go somewhere.
Are you sure about this?
an8There, there, Mom.
Looks like you avoided getting killed, Ishida.
Nah, I'll pass.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
I went and said together!
What's up?
Pardon me...
You can see the fireworks from here...?
Oh, she is here.
Nishimiya?
i1I beg you, God.
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
i1I should've asked her how she felt about me.
i1Sho.
i1So cold...
i1Yet so warm...
I called the shop, but nobody answered.
I'm sowwy...
I'm glad you're all right.
I failed to protect you again!
Hey.
Nishimiya,
Nishimiya,
I want to apologize to the others, too.
S-Sorry! Forget it!
Oh,
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya.
Gosh. You've cut it too short!
Hey.
Is that how they're used?
I've never told you this before,
Yasho?
Yasho...
I brought them, but I can't give him those. They came out really badly.
Sorry...
Playing friends, are we?
You're making my skin crawl.
I'm sorry.
You were going through so much, but I was no help.
I'm the same.
You apologized again.
Dumb-ass.
She ran away.
God, this is seriously yummy!
Hey, can you speak Japanese?
What? Not nice.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Start from here.
Are you kidding me?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ta...
Don't say that, Nao-chan!
You're welcome.
Show me for a sec.
Nishimiya-san!
What? Move.
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!
Wow, Nishimiya-san's funny.
Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.
Look, we all know it was you.
You're awful...
I would never do that!
Hold on!
I don't get it!
That's that.
Hello there, Shoko-chan.
Nishimiya!
Huh?
Breakfast time!
Your room was way too clean!
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
I'll burn the 1.7 million yen you shed blood, sweat, and tears to earn!
Hey! You listening to me?!
Right back at you, you stupid son!
Friends...
i1I realized that your sins always come back to bite you,
Morning.
i1Same.
i1Who was he, again?
Starving!
i1Tuesday...
I'm asking you because I don't have one!
Friends...
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.
Oh, right. This is good bread.
Let's go hang out after school today.
What are friends, anyway?Borderline keyframe snap. I think it looks better snapped as there's plenty of time to read this short line, but it comes down to personal preference.
It's good bread.
Goodbye.
That's what best friends do, right?
Isn't that Yuzuru-chan?
They're fighting.
Don't fall, laddy.
Oh, okay.
Nishimiya!
Thanks.
Wai
I was the one who tweeted that pic of you.
Is it too hot, Maria?
Huh...
I'm a terrible human being.
I have no right to live.
Sa... ha... ra?
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
I left all of a sudden...
Which high school do you go to?
What's your cup size?
Should I keep going and have Ueno meet Nishimiya, too?
Crap. He really came.
Well, you know...
I'm only here to meet your friend. No dirty thoughts whatsoever.
Oh, you're here?
Oh, yeah.
Later.
How have you been?
We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.
How? Why?
Yuduwu.
What a weird face.
I-I need to go buy the bread.
Do these look like the moon to you?
Really? But it looks nice.
Hey, Kawai-san.
Nice to meet you. I'm Sahara.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Hey!
Hey, what're you
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
Huh?
Are you mad?
Nobody asked you.
Probably.
i1So I changed my approach.
i1I ignored you and badmouthed you.
i1It's not like I want you to apologize.
i1But I'm not about to tell you we should be friends now.
I can't stand stuff like that.
an8What's wrong, Yasho?
Nishimiya-san?
Yasho?
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun.
Oh, Ishida.
N-Nothing.
Still, Mashiba-kun said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya-san.
Wait a second.
Mean!
It's all my fault.
I hate that line of thinking.
It doesn't bother me.
Sorry, Ishida.
Right.
Your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark.
Here.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
Seriously, what's up?
Nothing.
Why?
It does, or so I'd like to think.
i1Nishimiya said I'd end up unhappy if I was with her.
I wanna love people.
Even monsters have hearts...
This is great!
Whoa!2 Speakers
an8There, there, Mom.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
Then it's already passed!
But the fireworks aren't over yet.
Okay.
But...
Nishimiya?
N-Nishi
You're a cancer, Nishimiya.
piss me off the most!
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
Soww...
I'm sowwy...
I'm so sowwy!
Shall we head someplace else? I'll get you a drink.
You have to learn to love even the things you hate about yourself and move forward.
You went and saw everyone, huh?
I failed to protect you again!
You gan jange from now,
Oh, right.
You fell becas I couldn jange!
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Nishimiya.
H-Huh?
Oh,
Thanks for having me.
W-Welcome.
That's right. My son is invincible.
I'm off.
Shall we?
Are you okay now?
Ishida-kun!
If you...
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
Don't worry about what happened on the bridge!
So please, Yasho...
Nagatsuka-kun...
Playing friends, are we?
Hey, Class B's stall is seriously great.
What?
Okay, introduce yourself.
Same as Ishida, then.
Her nickname's Sho.
Nice.
I'll tell you when to start, okay?
Bye bye, Nishimiya.
What?
What?
How does this sound?
And it's much easier for me to write.
Um,
Sa.
Ishida, you're going too far.
Who cares?
Where were we, again...
If you're wearing these, can you actually hear?
Huh?!
See you tomorrow.
Yes, sir!
Especially Ueno and Kawai.
Shut up. I jumped off a bridge like always.
Are you causing trouble for others?
Was it true, what your teacher said?
Hey, what are you doing to my desk?
and it pisses me off!
I'm dryig, ju no!
Shoya Ishida.
Hey.
Wake up, Sho!
I'm off.
Here you go, Sho.
Right back at you, you stupid son!
I won't kill myself!
Kawai.
i1He's famous for it. Everyone knows.
It's true!
Dude, just let it go.
i1And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.
i1I need an excuse...
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
This is it!
What's your name?
Ishida!
Let's go hang out after school today.
Wait, Yasho?
And? Is something on your mind?
And that is what friends are.
She's not here.
Come on, Nagatsuka.Keyframe snap looks worse to me
I'm so glad.
Funny, right?
Nishimiya.
Hey...
This guy.
Thanks.
Hey...
About what?
You have a daughter?
Hey!
Here, Yuzuru.
Said she'd be late tonight.
Just take it.
Thanks.
Wait, you two live together?
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
You're disgusting.
Okay.
Hey, laddy.
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
You're pretty responsible.
You have one too, right?
Don't worry about it, Yasho.
Sis was pissed off you were leaving her out even though she was the one who asked.
We're giving out discount coupons!
Cat!
Isn't that Nishimiya?
The poor thing.
Gotcha.
Nah.
Id monig.
Ead breag
What a weird face.
...moo.
You look great!
Why'd you change your hairstyle?
Oh.
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
Oh, that would've really annoyed her.
Beats me.
I'm kinda scared.
Are you okay with having Ueno around?
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida.
You're funny, Nagatsuka.
Hey!
i1But this feels kinda like...
Huh?
You don't need to play peacemaker.
I figured things would work out if you met.
Take this with you, Sis.
What? How?
i1Let's not.
i1I ignored you and badmouthed you.
What about her?
Huh? Why do you ask?
We?
Nao...
I was only telling the truth!
Neither of you!
I hate that line of thinking.
Oh, buzz off. You don't know the first thing about me.
See you.
Is that so?
So...
Why?
Seriously, what's up?
I'm here.
Where are we going tomorrow?
Are you crazy?!
What are you making?
June 7th?
What's up?
Oh, she is here.
What are you doing, Nishimiya?
i1So cold...
I caused everyone trouble and was really hurt by it,
People like you, who can only see things from their own point of view,
It's not opening.
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
Nihimiya!
Id all my fauld!
Listen, Nishimiya.
It was within a dream.
H-Huh?
Crap!
S-Sorry! Forget it!
We've reached your destination, sir.
Maria, Sho came back to life.
Thanks for having me.
Who is that?
Huh?
Shoko broke the ice for me.
M-Morning, guys.
Is that how they're used?
I can walk just fine.
This is my class.
Hey, Nagatsuka. Morning.
Yasho, why are you looking down?
I beg you!
Oh, and...
You too, Mashiba.
You think I care?
There. Nice to meet you.
What? Not nice.
First up, the fulcrum. It's the point that supports the lever.
Once more, from the top.
You're gross!
Have you all heard of sign language?
Using sign language would make things much easier for Shoko-chan.
go...
Even after the experiment, the manganese dioxide...
What are you doing, Ishida?
And a star.
Looking good!
How mean.
Ueno.
Lemme see.
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
Yes, I understand.
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!
What? If you got something to say, say it!
Remember me?
Ishida Shoya.
Uh...
Don't cry.
But, uh, I won't...
So I was right!
I knew something was off!
Oh...
I won't do it!
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
I mean it!
i1At our middle school entrance ceremony, I overheard Shimada say...
Yes?
i1Who was he, again?
Sorry.
What?
Ishida-kun.
Uh, who arefscx150
Look.
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
Excuse me? What's your problem?
Isn't that Yuzuru-chan?
Nagatsukafscx150
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun!
Let me see!
I felt like I shouldn't come see you.
I've spent the past two weeks thinking about what friendship means.
Uh...
She fell...Kametsu: Jumped in...
Ew, what is this?
Huh? What's this?
Ishida-kun, come to the staff room.
I recently jumped off of Suimon Bridge and into the river despite it being banned
Thanks.
Someone's inside!
Hey!
Where are your shoes?
What the heck?
I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.
Sho-tan!
Coming.
Ow!
Great.
Oh, you...
Huh...
Well, I should've brought two.
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.
That won't happen.
I'm back.
Hey, laddy.
I knew that all along.
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
Is there anyone else you'd like to text?
Kawai-san.
Hey!
S-Sorry.
Remember me?
Okay, got it.
Onward to Meow Meow Club!
an8Seriously?
Wait, what?
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Isn't that a pouch from my workplace?
Sorry, Nishimiya.
I can't. This is too funny.
Well, have fun playing friends.
I'm up. Too surprised to sleep.
Nee-chanSis...
Nishimifscx150
She's sporting a ponytail?
Do I dalk weerd?
Nishimiya?
These?
Yeah.
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.
Why'd you change your hairstyle?
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
They're such simple words, but I couldn't understand them.
I'm kinda scared.
Wow.
Hey!
S-Stop it!
What are you doing?
Look, Ueno.
Ishida!
Yes, we are.
No, we're not.
Everything would've been fine and dandy if it wasn't for Nishimiya-san, right?
Hey!
What? How?
i1and have a stupid smile on your face all the time.
i1They were signs to stay away from me.
I want Nishimiya to come to love herself.
What're you talking about?
Something wrong?
Nao-chan?
That's messed up.
Shut up, Sahara.
I shouldn't have come.
Right.
Yuzu?
Your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark.
Hey, Yuzufscx150
What's with that outfit?
It's a uniform, obviously.
Um...
Nothing.
I saw you crying earlier.
Do whatever you want.
Nishimiya, let's go check it out.
Okay, Nishimiya?
Won't I get slapped again?
That looks great!2 Speakers
What are you doing?
Yum!
Then it's already passed!
Nishimiya?
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1Sorry.
i1So cold...
Please don't!
Quit trying to be some tragic heroine!
Stop it!
Why?
I'm not as strong as you.
Tahada-tan...
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
Nishimiya.
I hear you came to visit.
Thanks for having me.
W-Welcome.
Winter uniform?
How've you been?
Is that how they're used?
Morning.
The one who was hospitalized?
Yasho?
Yasho!
so it makes me really happy.
She was too embarrassed.
I'd like us to check out the festival together.
Hey, can you speak Japanese?
Uh...
Oh.
Do you have a nickname?
I give up! I'm tapping out!
Okay, note down the following sections.
We're screwed.
Qid beig sdubborn aready,
All right.
What?
Isn't it amazing?
How does this sound?
Isn't writing in her notebook good enough?
ko...
Don't say that, Nao!
Via this book, the author...
What are you doing, Ishida?
Who cares?
Ueno.
Lemme see.
Nishimiya, are you all right?
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
Wait, why are you soaking wet?
Don't ask me.
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!
What's with you?
And who was on flower duty?
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
I won't try to kill myself!
I mean it!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it, too.
You guys better stay away from that Shoya Ishida.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Shoya Ishida.
Yes?
Wanna go to the courtyard?
i1Will he spend his whole life like that?
i1But more importantly...
What is it?
I'll earn it again.
You must be starving.
i1Tuesday...
Hey, knock it off.
Somebody help!
i1It's not like I can't walk there,
Uh, she's right there.
Good timing!
What's wrong, Ishida?
N-Nothing.
Uh, she's right there.
Nishimiya likes younger boys?
Nagatsuka?
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
You turd-head.
Turd-head, turd-head, turd-head!
Let me see!
Don't know him at all.
Oh, okay.
Ew, what is this?
This guy.
an8Shoya!
Waifscx150
Hey...
Hey...
You'll catch a cold.
I had it coming.
Eat up.
Great.
Oh, you...
You can have them.
I used her shampoo without asking her.
She told me go away.
We only have the one, right?
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
Think you're a better person now?
I'm a terrible human being.
I have no right to live.
You're pretty responsible.
What?
So?
But I do know which school she goes to.
Hey!
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
I'm really glad to see you again.
Should I keep going and have Ueno meet Nishimiya, too?
i1What? Not happening.
Yeah, I agree.
Welcofscx150
Crap. He really came.
Don't be stupid.
Wait, what?
Long time no see.
Seriously, Ishida. It's been ages.
Let's hang out sometime.
What? I'll pass.
Gotcha.
How have you been?
Where I'm going?
Can I open it?
What?
These?
...moo.
N-Nishimiya?
Hey, Kawai.
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
Let's line up for that one first, everyone!
Yeah!2 Speakers
Here we go, then!
I learn so much from her artistic sense.
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
Though I am still terrified.
Oh, no, not good!
S-Stop it!
I'm not.
Nobody asked you.
If she wasn't around, things wouldn't have gotten awkward between Sahara and me.
And you and Shimada wouldn't have fallen out.
I should take Nishimiya.
Secretly filmed them.
i1Let's not.
i1and I'll pay attention to what you're saying.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1I hade mysel.
Ueno, was it?
Kawai said things were complicated in grade school.
Nishimiya really can't hear, huh?
Hey.
I called her.
I was only telling the truth!
Enough.
You don't have to put it like that.
Here.
You think?
What the heck?
Do you have another stomach ache?
School, duh.
Seriously, what's up?
Why?
It does, or so I'd like to think.
And why is that?
I'm here.
What are you trying to pull?
Nah, I'll pass.
So you're already eighteen, huh?
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
I'll walk you.
Nishimiya?
i1Man, I really messed up.
i1Yet so warm...
I finally got to see you.
Let go together. Come see him.kametsu: Come with me. Let him see your face. No English person would say this.
You see, Shokofscx150
Nishimiya?
Please, I beg you.
I'm sorry, huh?
Are you Shoko?
But we're all in the same boat, aren't we?
Tahada...
Nishimiya...
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm all good now.
I'd probably created a convenient image of you in my head.
Id all my fauld!
Looks like I was trying to give up on everything.
...live.
H-Huh?
She nursed you the entire time, you know.
Thanks for having me.
Yes?
I wanna live up to her expectations.
Who?
Is the water ready?
Gimme a bit more.
Nishimiya...
Sorry.
Hey, Nagatsuka. Morning.
Yasho!
I beg you!
I'm sorry about everything.
Also, thank you.
Yasho.
What's with the mustache?
What's up?
You got them?
What's your problem, Kawai? You wanna go?
She was too embarrassed.
Let's check out the gym next.
That'll get you around 30,000 yen in total.
So?
Holy crap!
Nishimiya.
Ow, that hurts.
I was distracted for half the class again.
You call that a reading, Ueno?
Screw you too, four-eyes.
Yikes, who did this?
There.
an8Made you jump, huh?
Ueno.
Lemme see.
What do we do?
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
Goodbye.
Wait, why are you soaking wet?
Yeah, it's true!
I'm dryig, ju no!
Uh...
You forgot this.
Hey...
Breakfast time!
But it really made me happy.
Why'd you want to kill yourself?
Your phone was off!
I'm truly sorry!
Good.
W-Water!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it, too.
Morning.
I will, sorry.
Seriously?
i1Will he spend his whole life like that?
i1Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
Take your time.
You must be starving.
i1an8Oh, it's that guy.
Keep it down, man!
Let go!
Huh? For real?
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
This is it!
Excuse me for asking,
There was just a rat out there.
I'm glad it had your address on it.
Oh, uh...
She's not here.
Wow, that's kinda unexpected.
Isn't that Yuzuru?
Nagatsuka...
Hey, laddy.
I never knew he had that skill.
I've spent the past two weeks thinking about what friendship means.
Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.
Ow!
Nishimiya!
Huh? What's this?
Oh, it's the rat.
Aren't you mad?
Sho!
Say aah!
Huh...
Okay.
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Later.
D-Do you text your friends and stuff?
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?
Sa... ha... ra?
Sis was pissed off you were leaving her out even though she was the one who asked.
What's your cup size?
Let me check!
Shall we go in, Nagatsuka?
Why does she have it? Scary.
Friends? That's hilarious!
I can't. This is too funny.
Is it out of guilt or something?
Yuduwu.
Id monig.
Nishimiya?
What the heck are these?
Yeah.
It is very pretty today.
Why'd you change it?
That's how it goes with girls.
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
Why?
Let's line up for that one first, everyone!
No way! Don't think it's that easy!
Hey, what're youfscx150
i1Huh?
i1You know, like a group of friends!
Sh-Shimada?
Secretly filmed them.
i1So how about we take it easy from now on?
What do you think?
But it was all your fault to begin with.
What right do we have to criticize Ishida over it?
Ah.
Huh? You're asking me?
What's gotten into you, Ishida?
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
Huh?
I'll be fine from here.
Say, let's hang out tomorrow, too.
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
This is great!
I'm really enjoying my time, seriously.
Where are we going tomorrow?
Hey...
What's the big deal? It's a happy occasion.
Sho said you should take part.
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.
I went and said together!
Could you go get my camera for me?
Whoa, it's dark.
Why...
i1Are you still mad?
I finally got to see you.
Ishida.
I'm truly sorry.
Please don't!
I was too negligent.
so I tried to commit suicide.
I'm sorry, huh?
Who the hell do you think you are?
What are you doing?
You have to learn to love even the things you hate about yourself and move forward.
You're strong.
i1Wah!
Hey.
I'm all good now.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry.
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
That was probably all.
You fell becas I couldn jange!
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Nishimiya.
I hear you came to visit.
Gosh. You've cut it too short!
W-Welcome.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no...
Get a load of this, Ishida.
Shoko broke the ice for me.
Yeah, you heard right.
Shall we?
The one who was hospitalized?
This is my class.
Are you okay now?
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
Yasho...
Those things happen in life.
Oh, and...
What's with the mustache?
I heard Nagatsuka screaming out your name.
Huh?
I'm sorry.
They're not talking about anything serious.
Well, I guess that's just who you are.
May I?
Childhood friend-type...
My master...
Then, we will register her and send her over later.
Yeah, of course!
Are you a pervert?
I am the maid and you are the master
I can't allow it because there's love
You can't make me do any more
Is for your eyes only, take a glance!
H... How indecent.
Why am I dressed in this embarrassing outfit?
Pig? You have such a foul mouth.
I did what a maid robot is supposed to do.
What are you going to do? Stop it!
Now, let me help you put it on.
I thought I was born into this world to work hard as a maid.
My master is a doll maniac with a dress-up fetish!
I can't! I can't go back to the store!
Yui?
Okay, Mr. Murase!
Yes? Mr. Murase...
No!
Yui
As was expected, Mr. Murase turned out to be a good-for-nothing master.
But he looks happy when he's asleep.
Where are your mom and dad?
No, the person doing that on the street... It's a crime.
You meant that one.
To those who delude with outrageous boobs...
...and Ran Mido, in the name of A-cup idol priestess sisters,
But you're cute too.
No, another pervert!
You are too young to say that!
The absolute area is only 3 mm.
You did good, Takaya.
I'm glad that you found your mom.
I saw something fun going on inside, so I joined without thinking.
How about this? Would you help us out once in a while?
My relatives are moving.
I can't ignore the true meaning of your reaction.
I'm just excited about what-if.
But I hope to have a baby someday.
Because I was born as a woman.
Before that, I need to find a partner.
Sure, if it's for a little while.
Thank you, it will be a huge help.
"My Breasts Don't Produce Milk"
Do you want food? Or did you poop?
It was somewhat noisy around Yui.
Oh no, could it be...
You're just like him.
It's a small elephant.
Huh? Welcome home, Mr. Murase.
What do you mean what? Don't you know?
Just smiling isn't enough
I want you, I want you
Can you hear me?
Etcetera, etcetera.
I'm sorry.
Calm down, I have clothes for you. Here!
Those dolls have gone somewhere by themselves.
You'll be cursed.
She's fast! Too fast!
If a Maid Robot runs away from their master,
Sorry about earlier.
That's your name.
I thought of it long before I met you.
Yui... A name only for me, given by my master.
I'm happy to be going out together with Murase-san!
Why do you have so many different kinds of maid costumes?
Why do I have to share the bed with him? Comment: Sorry. This is not literal, either.
It's criminal!
Oh no! These slimy tentacles are wrapping around me.
I'm Murase Takaya.
I'm Hagiwara Ayumi.
How about our caf then?
Welcome home.
Oh, you have company?
while satisfying your requirements for costumes. I find it admirable.
You've been tailored to his fetish!
So shall we have a party?
Her Absolute Territory is only 3 millimeters in length.
And so did you.
You met your Mom at last. Good for you!
Yup yup.
My name is Hagiwara Kanae.
Would you mind if I asked you to help us again once in a while?
Sure, go ahead.
So, the feeling of touching a living creature is just irresistible!
I'd like to go walking and shopping together with him.
My bad.
What should I do?
Who needs a maid that can't even take care of one baby?
Crappy robot!
Ah, yes, yes. Give me a moment.
Yeah, I'm back.
I was asked to take care of the baby.
Okay.
Yes!
Nice to meet you, Yui-san.
It must be really painful.
Um... I told you...
Kuon?
Please imagine it.
Ah... That's really sad...
Let's sort this out.
Answer your Master's expectations.
Onee-san, do your best!
I'm feeling nervous!
These are dishes from France.
I always want to see his smiling face.
Murase-san. Murase-san. Murase-san.
Why is Kuon-san at my house so early in the day?
B-B-Between the legs, it's on fire!
The ocean is beautiful.
Ah! Water! Water!
I caused you trouble again. I'm really sorry.
What are you doing, Sumitomo-san!
Did Murase-san do it only to make me happy?
That means I'm still young.
Having a well kept body shouldn't be odd.
How do you get them so big?
I'm a robot, I can't sweat!
How can a girl be like that?
You know how to deal with things, and you have a child.
Yui-chan only knows how to like something that has shape.
If it's not like that, then there will be no proof that it existed!
Even though my husband died...
Murase-san and I...
You're already a big girl!
It's alright, I don't mind.
We'll do this more often.
It's a promise.
Nearly there... I'm nearly there...
Wow... It's so well made.
"I'll cover your body with my colors."
The warm place which Sakuya and Takaya both love...
You can do anything to me...
Cursed?
Eh?! I'm not the one that's cursed, also it's not even close!
And coincidentally, Takaya bought one.
B... But Murase-san is an otaku!
Uh... Um...
What is it?
Your hair is messed up.
Good morning, Kuon-chan.
Ah, I'm sorry.
These are merely genetic, it can't be helped.
Um... That's why...
Girls should be elegant...
How could I let a new girl screw things up?
Could it be... the parts...
Sensei, Yui-chan is not feeling well.
I wasn't doing something like that!
Greetings, onee-sama.
Greetings.
Yes! Good day.
Get back to your seats!
That kid... She dodged our attacks.
We summon you, Octopus King!
Here, thank you.
That's not it!
Here, Sensei. Do what you need to do.
Onee-sama.
But... If it's her...
Oh, hello.
I have to go back now.
Did he change?
But how should I put it...
No wonder Takaya-kun hasn't been coming often.
Oh, it's Kuon-chan. Why are you here?
Let's stop this. Murase-san is entitled to his privacy.
Ayumi, where are you?
But, the truth has been revealed now.
What... even Sakuya-san...
Yui...
Normally, it would reboot after some time.
That's true.
Uh... That... Not really...
About that, I think I should clarify something.
Because Kuon still hasn't noticed yet.
Everyone is waiting for Yui.
Oh, you're still here.
Good morning, Yui.
Then what was I troubled by?
Image change... Store Manager?
Why is it like that?
It was just discussing about the new maid robot's abilities and looks.
Thanks to Murase-san, I've got plenty of good ideas.
Yes!
It's true, you're Yui-san!
I've heard a lot about you from the store manager of Maid Works.
Oh, I see.
Yes, nice to meet you too!
That is the uniform here, right?
I'm just a left over...
Ah, go ahead.
Kuon's room is on the second floor.
I'll be going.
Yes, I'll do my best.
You think you'll win if someone cheers for you?
These are dishes from France.
What do you think about my skills? Yui-san.
I need to learn more from you.
But, I will also do my best!
Store manager...
I did say that...
I have an idea.
B...Between the legs, it's on fire!
Takaya-san!
Sure.
Here, let's go.
Oh, ok.
You're not scared of water, right?
Pull the right leg out before it totally sinks in, pull the left let out before it toally sinks in... like this!
Eh? It's alright, so don't worry.
Transform!
How do you get them so big?
What does that mean?!
Why is it like this?
I'll feel bad.
Hey! Don't tell me you're troubled by that!
Yeah, I've seen it on T.V.
They are famous professionals in the world for making robots.
I've come back as a maid robot from MP!
Wow... It's such well made.
"I'll cover your body with my colors."
And then... Slowly getting wet...
Now do you believe it?
Seriously, something like a curse is unscientific.
But if you're a high technology maid robot, then that will make more sense.
But... the things you've done to Sakuya-san, you still want to do it?
I know it all.
I also know more than Yui.
S... Secret activities...
Murase-san!
You still haven't slept yet, Yui.
Are you together with Sakuya-san?
I see. Do your best, Sakuya.
Oh that, it's funny thinking about it.
Bye, Takaya, Yui.
Kuudere. TL-note: A girl who rarely let her feelings show, or is always unemotional.
Oh, nothing.
No. I need no one else but her.
Now I can...
Why am I dressed in this embarrassing outfit?!
Pig?!
Oh, I'm sorry.
That must be a lie!
Calm down, I have clothes for you. Here!
I am a maid, you know.
Have you woken up, my master?
That's how I'm programmed.
Okay, by the way...
I feel there's something strange about this room.
In such a situation, you'll need this costume.
No! Don't treat me as if I'm a dress-up doll!
And what's worse, he has a fetish for dress-up dolls.
I'm Takaya Murase.
then mod and customise me to your heart's content.
Please don't make me do anymore.
Why do you have so many different kinds of maid costumes?
You're gonna wear that costume tomorrow....
It's criminal!
The rabbit is really cute.
Heaven, boobs, and people call us!
...shall give punishment!
It looks kinda weird, are you really okay with it?
You met your Mom at last. Good for you!
I hope there's no hidden meaning in that reaction.
Actually, I wish that he were really my child.
Well, I can look after him for you if you'd like.
Sure, if it won't take too long.
I'll be back soon.
i1No, I can't...
i1There's no problem here at all, so take your time over there.
Don't throw me away, Murase-san! -Do you want me to break you up into parts of my computer?
i1I know he has everything, but he even has these?
Hey, here's your milk.
Don't tell me, that is...
I'm almost done here.
Yui has completely adapted to this caf.
Except for this weird uniform.
She's also a maid robot, but what a difference.
Because the characters in anime are like these.
Oh, this is Kuon.
She's a maid robot from Maid Works like me.
I don't need sympathy.
I'm a leftover after all.
Being covered by dust would best suit me.
Apron toccha ikemasen
Gohoshi suru tame urarete kita no ni
Hey, Yui, I'm not used to seeing you. What's going on?
X day of O month Oatmeal... Tastes good. Is this... X day of O month...
And it's half price...
But it's going to come to end.
Etsuko, is dinner ready yet?
Yes, I'll do my best.
Next, it's the final stage.
Yui, what did you think about my performance?
I hope I finally meet my master,
Actually, Yui seems to be pretty shocked.
The ocean is beautiful.
I brought you to a nice place like this, so just have fun.
But you've been only playing near water.
Groin on fire!! Water! Water! My groin is on fire!
Hey, you are good.
Am I?
I could never imagine that I came in contact with Mr. Murase so naturally.
If everyone works together, it will be done sooner.
Big-breasted girls will save the world
Did you have fun today?
Hey!
I'm sorry, Ayumi
Oh my goodness...
Oh my, it's the shame of a young lady.
I had a great day with you today, Yui.
I was worried if an indoor-type person like you would have fun outside like this.
Because I simply couldn't believe
Almost... I can see him soon.
Oh, that's why.
I've come back as a life-sized maid robot from MP.
Like that?
Anyway, you brought me home so suddenly, Takaya.
Like you did it before, you can touch me, open me and do everything with me.
Wakaba, Yang Yung, Wendy and Tina were there on the same shelf as me.
Are you the spirit of a doll or something?
Then, how did a figure become a maid robot?
That's because...
I know more about him than you do, Yui.
Sakuya...
Speaking of which, you didn't do it yesterday.
but Mr. Murase should never do it.
See you.
Onnanoko wa doshite
Tsumari mitamoto munamoto
Yes, I'm all right.
Are you a pervert?
Let's do things we've never done before
The romance hiding behind the apron
M... Mastbeeping?
You are...
Big sister...
It's not fair. Unforgivable!
That girl, she dodged our attacks.
Big sister, we should use that now.
Enjoy the world of adults as much as you like.
How could that be?
I don't give a damn about her advice.
I knew you were naughty.
It's wet and disgusting.
I'm going to get mad.
Who is it? Kuon!
Wait for me, Minori.
It's not that, I was just fooling around.
It hasn't been long since we got married,
You always come here during the day and do nothing but watch TV. Well, like how?
Well, I think there are some other things you should do.
Yui always takes good care of me.
Again? It must be hard.
I'm happy that he acts like a normal person.
Ma'am, your husband is cheating.
Is that so? I just saw him around here, so I thought he was here.
Where did he go?
Sakuya, are you sure they walked this way?
Hey, let's stop, even Mr. Murase needs private time.
Look, Kuon.
It's just your imagination.
You don't need to do anything.
No matter who the master goes out with,
I'm very happy if Takaya is happy.
It's the duty of maid robots, but...
Yui!
The fruit of my dream is still in business.
Thank you very much, store manager.
a maid robot has to serve the master with all her heart.
Do you like humans after all, Mr. Murase?
Image change...
You look like a desperate professional woman who's wearing her best dress.
Yui...
It's not true that you can't leave anything.
She's so beautiful...
Onee-sama... Huh?
Do you know what attitude is?
Ah, I'm sorry.
M... Mine?
But... they're made like that.
Oh, then someone should take her to the health office.
I... saw it, you flipped up your skirt.
It's noisy... in this toilet.
Our battle...
What's wrong with this school? Even in the health office...
I guess it can't be helped, I'll let you wear it too.
It's going to be alright.
Yui, sorry for the wait.
How about a fantasy genre next time?
Uh...
You don't understand the feeling of wanting to work, but not getting any.
No matter what, as a maid robot, we have to serve our masters.
Why don't you go back to the showroom and find a good master?
I'm happy that Murase-san can be so serious about one thing.
Where did Takaya go?
It's normal for a maid robot to find out what her master is doing!
Yeah! Yui-chan.
But...
What? Murase-san is by himself.
Then why did Yui fall in a coma?
It's a nice day like an Indian Summer.
Dad, I'm going to see Yui-chan.
Sure.
But Yui-chan is correct too, that's it.
Why is that person here?
It's shining!
It ends like this?
Eh? Yui-chan?!
That's why it's like this...
Peach blossoms, eh?
I'm going to cut off that black hair you're so proud of to decorate my helmet, along with your head!was: right along with your head for my helmet's decoration.
If only the government officials had gotten off their butts,
They're here!was: They appeared!
That sounded like a disaster.
When she was small, robbers broke into her house and killed her parents.
Right now, she's all by herself.
By the way, Mistress.
Today was a big success too!was: It's a big success today as well.
Bye.
See you tomorrow.
When tomorrow comes, I'll...
Hand over all your valuables!
This is terrible.
Compared to real bandits...
I won't let you catch the boss, no matter what!
This is annoying.
Wh-Wh-Who's an old woman, who's...
Even though I want to commend you for being clever kids...
Now, be prepared.
Kan Unchou, this is the failure of your life.
Of course not. I promise you.
You're Lin Lin, right?
Bring it on.
Comparing raw power leaves me at a disadvantage, eh?
Same to you.
It's none of your business!
This world, in which innocent people are hurt because they get caught up in wars and attacked by robbers? - this whole line is what she meant by "it" in the previous line -guu
I... I don't know about that!
I just want you to apologize to the village chief and the villagers, and to change your behavior.
TLC - is this something, or just a meaningless exclamation? - guu says just an exclamation
Yeah! We'll be together forever!
In that case, will you come together with me on a journey to change this world?
It doesn't seem so.
There are some who fight because they have someone to protect.
Kan'u, Chouun Head To Their Deaths.
Kan'u-san's going to die.
Why don't you call me by my mana, "Lin Lin"?
Please remain as you were.
You have quite a big child, considering your age.
Y-You have the wrong idea! Lin Lin isn't my daughter.
I'll undertake to test her, if you have no objections.
Are you scared?
Oh? You've got quite a lot of confidence.
Let me test that confidence of yours then.
It's embarrassing for me to say this, but we're having trouble getting rid of some bandits.
What do you say, Kan'u-dono?
Why?
A noisy person like you couldn't possibly do it.
Yeah. It's a little cramped, but it can't be helped.
Shh, the robbers might come at any time.
Huh? What are you saying, Bro?
We couldn't fit a bigger weapon than that, because your breasts took up so much space.
Stop it, please.TLC - more here?
But there are so many of them.
That idiot.
Geez. I thought your younger sister was the only hot-head, but you're quite a hot-head yourself.
Actually, the village kids are kept in the underground jail here.
Yes. And then she rushed out like the wind.
The key.
Just hurry!
Got it.
This is our territory.
Geez, how absurd our world has become.
If you are willing to apologize for your wrongdoings in hell, then come face me!
There are many who have been stripped of their belongings and killed.
Well, that was unfortunate.
As the name suggests, it's a brat-group with a girl named Rinrin as the boss.
Letting their child act like a bandit.
The best!
Aisha, wake up Aisha!
Brother, what's the matter?
Hide under the bed now!
Quickly!
I'm a traveling martial artist named Kannu.
From what I hear, Rinrin is a violent brat who even adults have trouble handling.
Someone like you will get beaten by Boss!
Get beaten!
Also known as Yokutoku!
I also lost my family when I was young.
To not let something like that happen again!
I just want you to apologize to the chief and the village people, and improve your behavior.
I've been traveling for a long time. I'm used to something like that.
Perfect temperature.
It's not bad at all.
Yeah...
This is our territory.
Bro, could she be the black-haired bandit hunter?
There's still nothing to be afraid of.
She's just going loose at the moment.
Yeah.
Then, me too!
Me too!
Yeah!
Let's play bandits again tomorrow!
That's some neat trick.
Well umm... isn't she treating her workers a bit too hard?
Understand? Even if they're kids, they're violent beyond our control.
Don't take them lightly!
This time he finally snapped.
Of course I have some confidence in my skills.
Umm... I wonder what you mean by that...
Old lady!
She did!
Hey!
Really?
Hey, let's go.
Geez, I might be older than them, but...
It's for close allies only, so there's no reason for you to call me that!
What's that got to do with anything?
Now I'm in a weird situation.
Even if you say so...
Thanks for lending me your bed.
It's fine. I lost the battle so it can't be helped if I have to sleep with you for one night.
And it's been so long since I slept with someone like this and...
Yay! I have an older sister now!
Now, now I won't be lonely during the night.
To change the world?
Good for you, Chouhi.
No, that's not it.
Get stronger on your training journey!
People who fight to protect others.
Keep your eyes open on the future of the peerless princesses who dance at the end of a century.
Next time on Koihime Musou, episode 2:
Pony Canyon
What?
known as Hakukei,
I'm having her stay here as a visiting general. alteratively sub-general
My name is Kannu,
and this is...
and Sousou, who's gaining prominence in the capital.
By that, you mean?
W-Well I'm...
Kousonsan-dono, I've certainly witnessed Kannu-dono's ability.
Hearing that, I made up a plan the other day.
It can't be helped. Since your breasts were too large, we couldn't carry any larger weapon.
No!
I beg you!
My name is Kannu, known as Unchou.
Umm,
Actually, the village children are caught in the underground gaol here.
She said that since Kannu-dono is late to return, she would go into the bandit's hideout herself.
This way!
Aisha!
Understood!
This is bad.
It's a blunt sword but it should be better than nothing.
Let's go, Chouun.
It's strange that I don't feel like losing when I entrust my back to you, Aisha.
But?
Kousonsan-dono is not a bad person at all.
Pony Canyon
What's the matter? You look so troubled.
Strange? What is strange, Chouhi?
I was so close to overlooking you.
My name is Kousonsan.
T-That's...
W-Well, leaving that stuff aside for later,
With the power of the old Kan Dynasty lost,
but aren't you jumping to conclusions?
I too, have heard rumors of the Black-haired bandit hunter while traveling.
So it might not be too late to test Kannu-dono's abilities first before hiring her.
If you have no problem, I would assume that task.
No way!
Well, that's...
By the way, Kousonsan-dono.
And the plan is?
We make a fake caravan, hide inside the goods,
That sounds like fun.
It's simple. I just have to stay still like this!
Don't give up!
Kousonsan-dono, call a doctor, a doctor now!
It's a bit tight, but that can't be helped.
I see, then...
What's the matter?
That idiot.
As I thought.
She said that since Kannu-dono is late to return, she would go into the bandit's hideout herself.
Geez, why is it just me...
Aisha!
I'll have you call me by my true name.
But?
Riding on a white horse, gloriously.
Chouhi has a battle with Bachou.
This program was brought to you by
Pony Canyon
5pb and
the following sponsors you see on screen.
title
since she came all the way from the capital to destroy the bandits who escaped into our territory,
we don't have the option of not greeting them.
Have her wait for a bit longer.
Umm, well, uhhhh...
Hey, she's making a fool out of us by saying that, you know.
We can depart as soon as we regroup.
Speaking of hair...
Sorry for the wait.
Now I'm going to somehow make lots of money and surprise Aisha!
Well yes, that's true but...
I hope you're not serious about being the champion part.
Of course I'm serious!
Lord of Kishuu, and from a highly prestigious family, Enshou-sama!
Geez.
Now for the closing speech, I, the prestigious, shall-
I see. So, a placement exam.
What? We'll get the axe!?
See?
So, first we have the Chouhi-Bachou team!
D-Don't look at me so closely. I know frilly things like this doesn't suit me well.
Heh, they're not too bad.
Finally we will have you compete with strength.
it will be a match of women's sumo wrestling!
Of course!
What did you think we were doing?
the following sponsors you see on screen.
Geez.
Your hair is also quite beautiful.
My name is Sousou. We shall meet again if there is a chance.
This job has the best pay out of what I found.
"It can't be helped," is no excuse, you have to do it properly!
I'm sorry. I'll try harder next time.
You do have quite some confidence, but that would be impossible.
The Kishuu No.1 Martial Arts Competition has finally begun!
strong ones with confidence in their skills from around the country will compete!
Now before we begin the matches, let's introduce this competition's sponsor.
Now we go onto the second match. One minute has already passed since it began.
On the other hand, the opponent was supposed to be a master of spears...
Bachou can't do anything but defend.
Now for the closing speech, I, the prestigious, shall-
So, my next workplace is at...
Eat well.
In simple terms, like a guest I guess.
Since I haven't been in battle for so long, I might be lacking exercise.
Do not recruit Chouhi and Bachou
Both of you saw how strong they were.
Compete, you say?
Just do this and...
Huh? Eh, I can't reach it!
It looks like they're ready!
Hey, do we really have to dress up like this?
Umm yeah, assessment please...
beautiful, dynamic and gorgeous swan loincloth,
Whaaaaaaaat!?
We await the Chouhi-Bachou team.
Even I find it too hard...
I'm called Bachou.
What did you think we were doing?
Pony Canyon and,
No worries.
the times are disappointing they say....
Karin-sama.
I'll wipe it off immediately.
Oh, it's Sousou!
Sousou, meet your end!
Daughter of the late Batou,
From your explanation, I don't find them being too evil.
I will go to Sousou-dono's place and see Bachou.
why don't we make a deal?
Sousou-dono,
There's no need to be scared.
I'm all right.
Right.
The nail that sticks out will get a pounding.
Umm, Sousou-dono?
Kannu-dono, I'm going to talk to myself now.
I did have everyone around keep their mouths shut.
Oh, this is all just my imagination though.
So you're saying I am telling lies?
I can imagine you were coaxed by Sousou.
She has no unguarded moment.
Then that means what she said was true and...
Oh, not that much.
I see.
Sui, you're hiding something, aren't you?
So wetting your bed was what you were hiding.
Daddy, I will practice a lot so...
Practice...
I was kicked off while sleeping.
In turn, while you were asleep I had...
Don't get all sore.
What are you smiling about?
What? Sousou!?
Sousou, meet your end!
Daughter of the late Batou,
No fighting!
Welcome back, my maste-
I heard there is someone by the name of Kannu here.
Let her in.
I can't just let her go with no charges.
Could this be your first time?
I like you even more.
Chase the bandit instead.
Karin-sama.
There are many in the capital who consider me a nuisance.
Those intruders ruined the fun.
I think I should sleep for the night.
So look forward to that time.
If it is the Great General's orders, I shall do so.
If you desire.
What, I haven't drunk anything yet.
You shouldn't push it.
But on the way...
Though someone may have been watching from somewhere.
And when things like this happen, gossipy people make bad rumors.
said it was the last favor asked by the famed Batou of Seiryou, so we don't have the option of not answering it
Oh, this is all just my imagination though.
Can you talk to yourself again in front of Bachou?
And I can feel her spirit like clear water...
See you!
You seem really happy saying goodbye to your friend.
That's already a thing in the past.
What are you saying, Aisha?
AND WHY IS THAT!?
Though you said you would tell me a shortcut to the village,
Of course it's the best-
What are you guys!
is the Black Haired Bandit Hunter!
I'm Kannu.
Oh, it's Kaku.
So it's the usual thing again.
Then what's wrong?
Eh, a monster?
I wanted to see for myself if it was true.
We got scolded in return, saying "Don't trouble the Lord saying a monster appeared."
So we sent the strong men from the village and traveling swordsmen to slay the monster but...
What will happen to this village now...
Oh, is it?
When I thought there was no choice for me but to camp out,
But after we know about it, we're not scared anymore!
You must have a name if you are no monster!
my master...
Double cooked pork for me, also white rice and egg soup.
But it was all to save the injured and deserted dogs.- uhh weren't dogs food? XD
And she says she will make as much reparation as she can.
No, that's not good.
Rather, don't cling to me!
Contestant No.2, Ryofu.
What are you saying, Aisha?
If they suddenly meet Aisha deep in a mountain like this,
the bear would be surprised.
It's pitiful for the bear...
I won't let bullies go!
going!
Geez, when it's so busy...
Yes...
Well, my body is maintained nice and strong!
suddenly a huge boulder was placed in front of the gate.
So they hurriedly offered food to the temple that night.
What is that!?
So, landlord, it's true that a monster appeared.
Was it that scary of a monster?
Oh, but deciding like that...
If it's like that...
That's great. You're going to accept it!
This shuddering is... out of excitement!
What!?
No.
You don't have to recall something like that now.
You finally came out.
Yes.
Watch out, it's her!
Ryofu Housen.
back...
Double cooked pork for me, also white rice and egg soup.
if you get into a dangerous situation...
Umm, sorry to interrupt but...
What!?
It's a good plan, isn't it?
Can't we?
She must be showing feelings of gratitude.
Then say it aloud!
Anyway, she came all the way from the capital to defeat the bandits in our territory.
Good workThank you? for coming all the way from the capital to defeat the bandits, Sousou.
Really?
Forget it.
My name is Sousou. We'll meet again if we have the chance.
She's a formidable person.
Here, goshujin-sama.
Sei, aren't you a bit too smooth?
Welcome back, goshujin-sama.
The winner will receive prize money?
You've got a lot of confidence there, but it's not possible.
Why?
Isn't it obvious? I'm the one who's going to win!
tough fighters have gathered here to compete for the title of the strongest!
Please fully enjoy the matches between the heroes who have gathered here today from across the country.
The little giant, competitor Chouhi, is now one step away from the championship!
Is this the birth of a new legend?!
This fierce fight is a perfect fit for the finals!
This match is a tie.
Therefore, both of you win.
Well then, everyone, the closing address will be given by none other than me, from the noble family
Morning, noon, and night, the best chefs will cook for you with all their skill.
Wh-What should we do?
If I can hire heroes like that to be my followers, I'll definitely triumph over Sousou.
Yeah.
First, we begin with the team of Chouhi and Bachou.
Eh, competitor Bachou seems to be very well-received by some members of the audience.
Eighty seven to thirteen, an overwhelming victory for the team of Chouhi and Bachou!
Yay, we did it!
I'm back.
AND WHY IS THAT!?
Ep5 Guan Yu Tries to Slay A Monster
That's wrong.
Unfortunately, we don't offer guides to heaven but,
I will send you to hell with this Green Dragon Crescent Blade!
going!
Getting rid of such scary looking people in a second,
Zhao Yun.
There's no need to worry.
Where are you?
Then what's wrong?
But it shouldn't be like this!
Eh, a monster?
What is that!?
Though nobody saw the exact figure,
That's great. You're going to accept it!
You two seem to be shaking a bit.
But...!
But you didn't have to follow us up here.
It's going that way.
I've never met anyone like her.
That her strength is comparable to that of a monster.
You guys are good guys.
Welcome...
I'm sorry.
It's been resolved already.
However small it may be, not neglecting the complaints of the people is the basis of politics.
and light it...
Since there is a mountain, it is a mountain.
Grandpa told me so.
If they suddenly meet Ai Sha deep in a mountain like this,
Though you said you would tell me a shortcut to the village,
Hey...
is the Black Haired Bandit Hunter!
we are,
all of you must be really strong.
Oh no, nothing like that...
O-Oh is that so...
Zhao Yun.
Yue, Yue?
Jia Xu, you're going to die early if you worry so much. Hua Xiong dies earlier XD
Well, my body is maintained nice and strong!
"Tonight, offer food at the temple in the outskirts of the village
This must be the boulder the monster left.
one says it was nine meter tall and had red glowing eyes.
There was one that said it was covered in hair and was making a fierce growl.
Oh, but deciding like that...
Well then, we entrust it to you.
So, we shall wait here until the monster comes out.
...it is!
You've revealed your identity.
Unlike those two fainted over there, I won't be surprised by something like that.
But you didn't have to follow us up here.
Yes...
The two that fainted on their own.
I tried to make money before but...
my master...
Double cooked pork for me, also white rice and egg soup.
Friends.
How worried do you think I was until I got informed!
But it was all to save the injured and deserted dogs.- uhh weren't dogs food? XD
I mean it!
Huh? Sei has leftover menma.
I'll give you my menma next time.
What happened to Sei?
Huh?
I am Shokatsuryou, with given name Koumei.
Phew, it's finished.
What are you saying? You can consider it lucky that your bone wasn't broken.
Oh, Koumei-dono can even cook?
Now let's begin eating.
T-Things like onigiririce balls and omusubi.also the same
That's not what I meant...
I've been entrusted.
She's outgoing and bright.
I love her so much.
What is she hesitating for?
So she must be scared and can't cross the suspension bridge.
When master was here, she held my hand and we crossed it together.
I'll pick it and bring it back after she gives up and leaves.
Why...? I just came here, by chance. By chance it is!
That aside, we have to pick the Salonpa-grass.
Take it.
But Chouhi-san, it's your...
If that's fine, then do as you wish.
Then, I have one favor to ask you.
There's no end to it. "mattaku 'kiri' ga nai na" she says, which is a pun on the word kiri which also can mean an end as well as fog, maybe a TL note at the end?
This is bad. We won't notice if we go off track.
Sei, don't be mad forever and answer me.
In any case, there's nothing we can do in this fog.
Menma...
Hey, don't move around!
Oh, that is bad.
I see. That was unfortunate for you.
This should do the job.
Your stray partner might be found in the meantime.
Yes, master.
Suikyou-dono, I am thankful for your treatment but you don't have to do this much...
What are you saying? You can consider it lucky that your bone wasn't broken.
No problem. If you want to pee, I will carry you to the bathroom.
I can cook too!
A friend coming from far away, is also happy.
She's outgoing and bright.
We're not! The two of us aren't mother and daughter but sisters, and it's even an oath of sisterhood.
While she was being thrown around her relatives with her sisters, they were separated.
I see, Koumei-dono, you really are a good child.
What a clumsy girl she is, stumbling upon nothing.
Finally I'm here.
You're the one who found it.
I only helped out, so you give it to Aisha.
Um, Chouhi-san,
Can I call you Rinrin-chan?
Oh, the swelling has gone away completely.
Can't you tell me anything I can do?
So if it is all right, I would like you to add her to your traveling partners.
I'm sorry. Like this showing an apology gesture
Ah, it was delicious.
Huh? Xing has leftover menma.
Then I'm going to eat it!
Menma...
You can have mine too.
Xing, Xing are you there?
Where are you?
Oh no, what should we do?
Menma...
Oh, there's a house over there!
We're saved. Let's ask them to let us rest for a while there.
Ah, sorry...
So thankful of you...
Yes, master.
Oh, Kong Ming-dono can even cook?
compared to that, Ling Ling only eats.
Oh, then what can you make?
Hey, don't wander around dressed like that.
I thank you for your kindness, but that's a bit...
Oh, if it's so,
I made this. - I think Kong Ming made something like this in history also...
Master Yu says, if a person has personality and piety, they...
Oh, you are not?
Why such a confusion?
While she was being thrown around her relatives with her sisters, they were separated.
Be careful not to fall.
I won't have her look all good!
Why...? I just came here, by chance. By chance it is!
What are you saying!
So I'm not kind at all!
Wha-
No need to thank me.
Then, I have one favor to ask you.
Master says...
ed
Graduation meaning...?
Umm, are these really my final words?
I saved it for last because it's my favorite. - and you can see her eating lots of menma in the ED
There's no end to it. "mattaku 'kiri' ga nai na" she says, which is a pun on the word kiri which also can mean an end as well as fog, maybe a TL note at the end?
Ling Ling, wait! Don't go off on your own!
Xing, don't be mad forever and answer me.
Xing, where are...
It looks like I sprained my ankle...
Hawawawawa
I see. That was unfortunate for you.
This should do the job.
No problem. If you want to pee, I will carry you to the bathroom.
But before that...
That's not what I meant...
Understood!
This is useful.
Not being concerned about how well you are praisedacceptedaknowledged, recoginized, mustn't that be how a great person shall be.
Isn't Ling Ling-chan also a good child?
I love her so much.
Huh? Mother?
Oh, you are not?
It's been three days since applying the poultice but the swelling hasn't healed much yet.
...is not how it should go.
What a clumsy girl she is, stumbling upon nothing.
Since she walks slowly, I can easily outrun her after picking them later for sure. - uhh can you remember the path XD
But...
Why is it?
Could you have been following...
What are you saying!
So I'm not kind at all!
Oh?
That means...
But then I'm not comfortable with it.
It will become quite lonely here if she leaves.
ed
Hey Rinrin, don't get too far ahead alone.
Chouun.
I'm sure she is doing well somewhere under the sky.
Leave it to me in situations like this! these dialogues soooo resemble ep6
Last time, when we followed your fortune telling, we got caught in the fog, I slipped off a cliff, got injured, and had so much trouble. but you got Koumei?
Hawawawawawa no idea what to do with this note..pointless to even be there-campa
Then...
"On second thought I'm going to go the same way as the others"
But Aisha has the wallet so I can't eat. okay now you're evil Kannu...
Hey, long time no see.
First, it's contestant Bachou who came all the way from Seiryou.
Even though she should have eaten more than anyone in the previous matches, she still had such power left?
I am going to die falling forward...

If you're alone and have nowhere to go.
Look
Chouhi's acquaintance?
Let go already!
Um, next on Koihime Musou Episode 7...
HEY That was the previous one!
Hey Rinrin, don't get too far ahead alone.
Which way shall we go?
If you say so...
And I will!nico comment: Rinrin DIE!
Rinrin-chan! nico comment: Koumei: 'All as I planned'
"On second thought I'm going to go the same way as the others"
Those idiots!
Hmm, it doesn't have too many difficult characters but I can't read it, as expected.
So we're nearing the finale of the annual eating competition. you again lol
Don't call me small!
Now that we are ready, battle start! this line could be snaped back to the frame.. qc's call
I am going to die falling forward...
Actually...
Aisha was being mean and so...
You two are the first to come that far competing against me. nico: her head is a seashell
I have given back the amount I was lent ages ago.
Gimme that!
You didn't have to include me!
Runt...
Damn, if I knew that I really would have smashed them. nico: what about those houses you smashed
What are you saying?
We are having them stay as appreciation for saving you.
Weren't you together?
What did you come here for!
You were here as expected.
It's not the time to fight against each other...
Where'd you pull that from...
Master, it's too bad for you. but I have my own business as well.

Taking hostages and playing dirty, thank you for ruining my fun.
GOT IT!?
Geez.
As a vagabond like I've been.
Why, why are you here?
That's well... umm you know... how should I say...
Of course...
Yes.
Chouhi's acquaintance?
Then, goodbye!
Notes: "10mankin manjyuu": 10mankin manjyuu is a parody on the 10mangoku manjyuu, a famous treat from Sitama
Naturally.
That's why I'm saying it's annoying.
and trail us.
Winner receives a large sum of money with sub-prizes.
I did what I needed to and departed again for training but...
That's right!
That's not going to happen!
Let's introduce the three warriors who got it up to the final round.
Is this it? Is this where I fall?
What? You lost Zhao Yun on the way, and had a fight and separated from Guan Yu?
Going around the country training for mass-eating.
It's some coincidence that we got to know each other
to have us know each other more, why don't we go out to eat something delicious now?
Here are the bonds.
Stop it right there!
Who are you calling tiny?
Who? It's you, you and...
Sis, they seem to be in the middle of a journey.
What's the matter, Zhang Fei?
Sis, this person is great.
By the way, what happened to Zhang Fei?
Weren't you together?
What? You're here to be screwed again?
I accepted the position as your bodyguard with cheap pay because you were going to let me fight against really strong people.
I don't have anything against youhave no grudge against you, but this is my job. You will be enjoying some pain.
That's the spirit.
Taking hostages and playing dirty, thank you for ruining my fun.
Then scram!
I see. Then we will be separating here on.
I turned back yesterday morning and arrived in the city before dusk.
We looked through all the inns in the city but couldn't find you,
then Kong Ming-dono suggested that we might be able to see you if we wait in the streets near the entrances of the city.
AAGH GEEZ!
Get this Ling Ling? I am the older sister and you are the younger sister.
I'm not going to let you go!
Episode 8 Guan Yu Tries to Stop Huang Zhong's Plot
Zhao Yun.
Which way shall we go?
That way!
Hey wait, Ling Ling!
That's not going to happen!
So we're nearing the finale of the annual eating competition. you again lol
Even though she should have eaten more than anyone in the previous matches, she still had such power left?
Even if I were to die shamefully in a sewer,
Ma Chao is knocked out?
If I eat these, eat these, I'll beat her!
We didn't get the reward...
By the way, what happened to Guan Yu and Zhao Yun?
Are they working in some shop again?
Ling Ling is Zhang Fei with given name Yi De.
I have given back the amount I was lent ages ago.
What are you guys?
Whether you are an eating practitioner or an ant-eater, you're going to get hurt if you get involved.
They are so sneaky.
They said they haven't chosen where to stay for the night so
how about we have them stay here to show our appreciation?
Then, take this as the lodging.
I can't have you do that.
What's the matter, Zhang Fei?
Nothing...
But you can't leave her like that.
I am really thankful for having you help with things like this.
By the way, what happened to Zhang Fei?
this might want to be subed.. or is part of the last line and that needs to be spilt.. dont feel like checking.-campa
"What's the meaning of" what?
Ouch!
the ambassador of beauty and justice, Kachou Mask appears! Kachou having the characters Flower and Butterfly
Chou Mask but you're...
Oh man...
If you're alone and have nowhere to go.
All right?
It's not about that.
but I couldn't understand your feelings from yours. I'm frustrated.
Really?
You finally woke up.
What did you do to me while I was asleep? Hey!
In the past, there was a country called Etsu.
There was no need for me to be there.
Well, then.
Karin-sama.
She's mean.
I never expected to run into her in a place like that.
To make things worse, Chouhi got in my way.
I'll get right to the point. What do you plan to do about Bachou?
You're right, but...
Ever since I first saw you, I've always wanted to stroke your glossy hair.
Wh-What a ridiculous thing to ask, especially in a matter concerning a person's life.
Yes, ma'am!
Where's the assassin?
How about you have a match with someone here and show me your skills?
If that's what you wish.
In order to divert his humiliation in front of the whole company, Batou-dono drank like a fish after that.
Perhaps Bachou also believed it.
What you said to yourself just now, could you do that again in front of Bachou?
Bachou, Sousou-dono kept quiet about this for you and Batou-dono.
Her calm posture is like a grove in the deep woods.
We just became friends, too. It's a pity.
Nah, don't worry about it.
Especially from Chouhi.
B-Bye!
Bye-bye! I'll see you later!
Kan'u Exterminates A Ghost.
I made such a misunderstanding...
All because of you I was...
Followers like you shall pay of course.
Hey! !stab Shaoren please!
Wait!
Hey, what are you...
Wasn't it?
Just to be sure, I didn't escape like a runaway because I hated the way too formal way of living!
A parade?
But now we know the reason.
That was to prevent suspicious people from entering. and you guys were ok?you know, the beautiful black haired bandit hunter thingy
Anyway, I'm tired of the killing and getting killed.
Says someone who was snoring with her stomach exposed.
Tomorrow after lunch, that parade is coming to the street right before here.
I see, you were from yesterday...
There is nothing to be thanked for.
and a letter was left there.
otherwise we can not guarantee her life."
Unforgivable!
My daughter, my daughter is all right, is she not!
It all depends on your answer.
I can't take off any more. to have it aired on Japanese TV
Don't be a fool!
Aisha, I've finished off all those people at the bottom!
I understand.
Kannu-san, how may I thank you...
no more.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Rinrin-chan was...
Oh, that means...
the Blond-Drill will be the Seme and the Side Ponytail the Uke.
Hey, don't teach strange things to children!
I made such a misunderstanding...
Where have you been hiding!?
Umm, Shao or whoever, I don't get the picture at all.
Hey, don't get too familiar calling me Shao even though we've just met!
Do you have the money for dinner in the first place?
Followers like you shall pay of course.
That's not something to be amazed about...
What are you doing, idiot!
Her aim could have been off and it coincidentally...
A fearful talent.
I thought so.
Ahh.
Thank you for what you've done for my group's people the day before.
Even if the security did not consider this possibility, they won't be blamed for it.
That picture is...
Don't you think this person reminds you of someone?
No, I don't think so.
But...
I'm coming in.
What? There's a kidnapped girl in the old building across the street?
You still have the bottom.
Diversionary tactic working...
Get her!and they all have box cutters lol
Aisha, I've finished off all those people at the bottom!
Riri-dono, let's go.
Hey, it's about time.
Hey, what's wrong?
Not...?
Hey, don't teach strange things to children!
Notes: "Seme" and "Uke": ...are the words for describing the partners of a lesbian relationship. They can be roughly translated as "Attacker" and "Receiver". Watch episode 2 if you still don't know about it.
Umm well, I didn't know that so...
That was such a misfortune.
Who are you calling tiny girl!?
A-ny-wa-y...
Hey, dinner.
Heh, I consider anything good if I'm hungry so you have nothing to be proud of.
That is, umm...
I see...
But there's a strange rumor...
But now we know the reason.
Hey, where are you going?
A guest for me?
I just can't mind my own business, so I do unnecessary things.
What a fine weather.
Don't move!
I lived together with my young daughter Lili
otherwise we can not guarantee her life."
Unforgivable!
But... but...
Hey, what are these?
Then I'll strip down so you can check if I have the things that were stolen.
Hey hey, it's getting interesting!
3...!
Yes...
Then we have no choice, it's all or nothing.
Y-yes...
Guan Yu-san, how may I thank you...
The weather's good. - the faces look kinda squashed...
That was such a misfortune.
That's right.
Shut up, tiny girl No. 2.
Kong Ming's treated as a tiny girl.
Episode 8 Guan Yu tries to prevent Huang Zhong's plan
What are you saying?
Hey! !stab Xiao Lian please!
What's happening?
It's a godly skill.
Oh, thank you.
Actually, the third son of the landlord of the adjacent land will come to be son-in-law to marry the daughter of the landlord here.Men in Koihime who aren't bandits!?
so people are here because they want a look.
Reason?
Yes.
An already leaked conspiracy plot actually working isn't too common.
I hope so.
Hey, don't say things out of your imagination!
That is!?
I see, you were from yesterday...
I'm called Guan Yu.
Looks like you're not as talented with long weapons as with bow and arrow.
But... but...
One of their clan brought this to ensure she was ok.
Kong Ming-dono, does this picture mean anything?
Please wait.
Why?
If we hurry, it shouldn't take too long to get to that tea shop.
Huang Zhong-dono, I, Guan Yu, vow to save your daughter even at the price of my life!
Guan Yu-san...
Rather, it's so ordinary that it's boring.
You still have the bottom.
What the hell are you!
Let's go home together.
With a mask?
I understand.
Hold on tight.
Hey, it's about time.
Thank you, big sis.
Hey, don't teach strange things to children!
And what is that thing of yours you want to show even at the cost of destroying my peaceful time?
Yes, when we were bug-repel-drying the things in the storage, we found this.
So that means...!
Yes, a treasure map!
Yes...
And this is a hot spring.
We can't bathe if it's like this.
Yes, when we wanted to relieve our stress in a hot spring.
Shunran.
But to become followers of someone unknown if we lose...
We just have to win.
By the way Keifa, we've been walking for quite a while.
Will something like that really help us find a hot spring?
Hey, from the way you said that, it makes it look like I'm dragging you down.
We should see what they do for a while.
How is that going to help?
Ready. Go!
Of course.
Oh?
Reiha-sama, their map doesn't look like it has been eaten by bugs.
Hey, shut up!
Hand over the map to me.
I understand how you feel, but she has her position to uphold.
Reiha-sama!
Let me cross the river to meet grandma...
Eh? But what about the treasure?
It's all right.
Do you understand? This hot spring was discovered by me! You'd better be thankful to me!
Oh my! I think the flat-chested girl just said something.
Hey, you!
Hey. Which side are you on, Shunran?
That's enough!
How deplorable!
What is this...?
So that means...!
Shunran, don't make such an evil face.
That is true, but...
sniff sniff.
I'm the first one in!
What happened?
What is this!
You are...
According to the villagers, about half a month ago, after a large earthquake,
Umm everyone,
Shunran.
We just have to win.
No, it's not like that.
is so great it can find not only hot springs, but even concrete pipes running underground.and all this in the third century ladies and gentlemen
We're not lost, are we?
You found it?
Success or failure, why don't we jump in and beat the hell out of them?
Should I say, that's how it is...
What?
It's 34! - this is what herhis point was in kouei's game I think... someone check lol
Looks like they found it.
The treasure is here. If we move the rock...
Then how about helping us for a change?
We lived together ever since he was a cub.
They look alike, so I was sure that...
Abalone guts is good for that too.
It seems they are looking for the treasure too.
Reiha-sama, their map doesn't look like it has been eaten by bugs.
I'm the one looking stupid here!
I heard that!
Do you really think we'll fall for that?
Let me cross the river to meet grandma...
After all, I've found something more precious to me than the treasure.
So what if you found it? You found it by chance anyway.
Yes, it sounds like a case of sour grapes.
Quantity over quality? That certainly sounds like what the Enshou army strives for.
They can see everything!
That women with big breasts are dumb is just a myth!
That's enough!
I'm no longer in the mood for fights.
No point quarreling when we finally got ourselves a hot spring.
How about enjoying ourselves?
Ahh, bathing is the best.
It's all right.
So that means...!
That's right.
And the water is known to have skin beautifying effects.
Why don't you come this way?
sniff sniff.
Ouch!
Yes, when we wanted to relieve our stress in a hot spring.
Hua Lin-sama!
Understood.
Hey, why are you deciding by yourself?
Umm, hey wait... umm.
To get someone as great as Guan Yu, we have to take some risks.
this map has many lost parts from bug erosion.
What is this!
That's a good plandejavu.
Don't we often go to the toilet together too?
Hey, isn't the spring water coming out yet?
I don't want to. I am a princess so I hate doing sweaty work.
Spring water often emerges from the intersections of the strata and the water veins.
Hey, it's dangerous to go off by yourself!
I've mistaken him for the wrong bear.kumachigai? lol
Jeez... what do you mean, a touching reunion?
It seems they are looking for the treasure too.
We don't really care what happens to her.
I heard that!
Grandma!
Let me cross the river to meet grandma...
Li Yu-sama!
Dou Shi.
The real treasure was right beside me to begin with.
It's warm!
Oh my! I think the flat-chested girl just said something.
Girls with small breasts are small-minded indeed.
It's our complete victory in quantity.
We should consider things like the color, the shape... and the sensitivity.
Is that right, Hua Lin-sama?
Then let's see who is the most sensitive one!
Don't look. That's not what children should see.
That's enough!
I want to go to a hot spring too.
Time for the preview.
Those vital parts aren't going to be exposed anyway because of thetv only not in dvd mist.
Such a dirty map.
Now our financial situation that has been threatened by Li Yu-sama's erratic spending can be...
That's true.
It's a relatively unknown and great place where only the experienced know.
We have to have someone stay behind just in case...
That means...?
Oh everyone, it's not that. It's the smell of sulfur.
Sulfur?
To bathe in the hot spring of course.
According to the villagers, about half a month ago, after a large earthquake,
Find a new hot spring?
Chun Lan.
But to become followers of someone unknown if we lose...
No, it's not like that.
No need to worry.
Should I say, that's how it is...
Ready. Go!
I said wait!
It's a bear.
Jeez... what do you mean, a touching reunion?
Putting orange skin on the tip of her nose works too!
Do you really think we'll fall for that?
Thank goodness! You've finally come to!
The real treasure was right beside me to begin with.
It's warm!
Or is it that the nutrients went to the useless blubber on your chest,
Li Yu-sama!
That women with big breasts are dumb is just a myth!
Ladies... Goodbye!
You have a point.
Shall I go and have a drink together with Gongsun Zan-dono after work today?pls check name
Sonken, what are you saying!
Shoukyou
That's true.
Bad omen?
I shall grab dominance with this hand.
Sheren-sama...
Choushou-dono, you are the eldest of us.
Wow, this is Choukou?
It's huge!and muddy...?
What are you saying?
They will cry from happiness at my return and there's no way I will be scolded.
Umm, Aunt Sonsei,
an8How many times do I have to tell you?
Kannu, Chouhi, Koumei, the Son family of Koutou welcomes you.
You still seem sleepy.
Why don't I look for some mountain birds.
Didn't you have your followers go along with them as a guide?
B-but...!
Is it not?
That's right, Shuuyu.
What's the matter, so late at night?
How fortunate.
Though she must stay absolutely calm for a while,
no matter how much blood is spilt, I still have something I want.
Then the misconduct for the people who agreed on this.
I'm afraid so.
Yes, surely.
So can you send us off on our journey with a smile?
It would be easy if we could go on the ground in this too.
Yes...
There's no need to sing so go home!
What is it, Renfa?
Sonken, what are you saying!
but if we stop here, we may dominate the Koutou region, and only end there.
We will never reach dominance of the land.
But Sheren-sama...
Well, being too smart is a trouble after all.
When I see this scenery, I sure feel back at home.
What are you saying?
Do you know how much trouble you are causing?
She was really troubling!
Surely, she must have been.
I empathize with you.
Sheren-oneesama, that's cruel.
But why did I see such a dream now?
Bow-wow!
How silly.
Koumei-dono said she wanted to see the library, so Rikuson is guiding her.
Why don't we have a battle to see if we are different or not?
It isn't stupid at all!
I don't have definite proof but,
The moment my sister was shot, a unknown traveling martial artist was there.
I work under the Son family!
and giving her such shame, is nothing you can say without compensation either.
That's enough.
Aunt.
you will collapse at this rate.
What's the matter, so late at night?
Oh, it's the opposite.
Please write me a letter if you feel like it.
You two are still at it?
Yes...
Shuuyu-sama.
you brought me to this place.
The heaven you're going to take her to seems like a very nice place.
If you're heading to the village, would you like to come along with us?
"Just as it's reassuring to have traveling companions, it's... it's..."
Kaku, you'll die young if you worry so much.
Yes. We were at our wit's end and tried appealing to the government officials.
Another person said that its whole body was covered in thick hair, and that it had a scary roar.
What's wrong? Did something appear?
I'm thinking that even though the moon is quite beautiful, there are too many clouds.
When we were having dumplings at the tea house yesterday, did you eat one more than I did?
I started walking, trying to cross the hill before it got dark,
When I nervously tried to open it...
Oops, did I overdo it a bit?
You could've waited for us in the village.
Since the enemy isn't a monster, there might be a reason for her actions.
Yeah. That place is probably her home.
Be careful. It's her.
You're the two who passed out so woefully yesterday.
W-We failed last night, but we won't this time.
Since you're not a monster, tell us your name.
The food you made the villagers prepare was to feed the dog?
Um, I'll have fried rice and dumplings.
My name is Kaku. My courtesy name is Bunwa.
But it was all for the sake of injured and abandoned dogs.
She didn't do it for malicious reasons.
No matter how trivial a matter is, it's the responsibility of government to treat the citizens' complaints seriously.
And... can I keep those dogs at my place?
Wait, Yue, what's with that "I love you"?
I-I'm telling you, though, this is the only time I'll agree to such an unreasonable request.
Wait, Yue, you can't perform such a dangerous parlor trick!
Chouhi, Koumei Compete With Each Other.
Nothing is more favorable than your safe return.
Sister, why do you like war so much?
episode 10 Sun Ce's life is threatened
Ming Lin, when it is only us, we promised to call each other by our true names, right?
Our mother who was called the Tiger of Jiang Dong, the late Sun Jian.
What I grabbed from her with bloody hands,
Ming Lin, you're over thinking things.
I shall grab dominance with this hand.
Geez! War, war, war!
How many have we had this year?
wouldn't you get in big trouble from your family?
A princess of the Sun family disappearing without companions.
Umm, Aunt Sun Jing,
Do you know how much trouble you are causing?
So it wasn't that Shang Xiang was a pitiful kid.
How could you do such actions in the first place?
She was really troubling!
Surely, she must have been.
So you were the cause.
I drank too much last night.
but books on agriculture, astronomy, history, calendars.
By reading them, an ecstasy called knowledge comes like a wave.
I shall pick up the game.
You are even more flat-chestedtsurupettan and baby-bodied.
It isn't stupid at all!
Zhou Yu!
We sucked out the poison from the wound and kept her alive but,
Guan Yu-san, what happened?
The moment my sister was shot, a unknown traveling martial artist was there.
Didn't you have your followers go along with them as a guide?
But it's wrong to treat Ai Sha with suspicion!
Everyday friction, differences in thought, differences in interest.
B-but...!
Sun Quan-sama, it looks like you jumped to conclusions too quickly.
That's right, Zhou Yu.
I am sorry, Guan Yu-dono.
What's the matter, so late at night?
I see, so there's poison smeared on the tip of that needle.
could you have forgotten?
next time we meet, it's seven matches on size, shape, color, luster, sensitivity, elasticity and taste!
the main episode has already finished.
Next time on Koihime Musou Episode 11.
episode 11 kannu meets ryuubi
The injury was just a scratch.
Sun Ce has done this time and time again to raise the name of our family.
Our mother who was called the Tiger of Jiang Dong, the late Sun Jian.
Bad omen?
But Xue Lian-sama...
No need to worry.
You will be with me until that pursuit is fulfilled, right?
Yes, the preparation is already complete.
Isn't it great?
The "back at home" part is okay but,
A princess of the Sun family disappearing without companions.
Umm, Aunt Sun Jing,
Do you know how much trouble you are causing?
They all show their bellybuttons.
She was really troubling!
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Kong Ming, the Sun family of Jiang Dong welcomes you.
And my chest still feels heavy...
Yes, she seems quite skilled so it's a pity to let her loose.
Yes, they already finished breakfast.
Did you send someone as a companion?
Yes. Since I love books.
Though not as good as that Huang Zhong,
I do have confidence in my archery skills.
You are even more flat-chestedtsurupettan and baby-bodied.
Zhang Fei, we show each other's busts over there.
she has yet to regain consciousness.
Wha-?
Guan Yu-san wouldn't do such thing.
It's natural to become suspicious.
Didn't you have your followers go along with them as a guide?
Yes, I did.
That means when Sun Ce-san was hit, you too, were alone at the hunting grounds in the mountain.
I work under the Sun family!
Am I wrong?
If you didn't say anything...
That's right, Zhou Yu.
Sun Quan,
Though her consciousness level isn't too high,
I see, so there's poison smeared on the tip of that needle.
Yes, all like planned.
Then the misconduct for the people who agreed on this.
I wanted to talk much more about books.
You may forget about it.
I was totally wrong that time.
I was completely at unrest and put suspicion on you, who was purely innocent.
Ahh, a journey aboard a ship is nice.
Being able to get to the goal relaxed like this.
It sure is.
Oh no, I just was concerned about something.
Things just went way too smoothly,
Amusing you say.
Then at least let me give the preview.
Then let me sing one song!
Huh?
Stop it!
What's the matter, Kannu-san?
Damn.
Press on!
What's the matter, commander of the volunteer army?
It sure is great to live long.to experience many things
Yes.
we took arms.
But...
We thought of having him leave the village if he lost this time but...
Dammit, it's a trap.
With me and Aisha here, there's no need for complicated plans.
It sure is beautiful.
W-what are you saying?
Huh?
I don't consider myself fit as a ruler of someone heroic like you,
Oh, you were here!
Koumei-dono, isn't this enough for picking herbs?
But the sun is setting. I leave it to you Gains
It lives off dead bodies of animals.
That's why it is called the Three-day Grass but,
I have to hurry or it's going to come out.
This time it was Bachou-san mistaking it while being half asleep but,
him.
And he keeps all the treasures he gets from the bandits' lair for himself in the storage here.
What was that for!
The Rinrin bandits are unlike those weaklings.
Well, hmm since you'd have to pass through two or three mountains from here so...
Would you tell me some details about the volunteer army in Toukason?
Hey Bro,
intermission
ed
You must be one of the volunteer army or whatever.
What's the matter, Kannu-san?
I don't really understand but,
Understood!super action scenes coming
I am Kannu.
Umm.
I did win and come back.
Landlord...
I will smash you to nothingness!
Oh my, after you joined the army, every battle ends in victories.
Ryuubi-dono.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
But the sun is setting. I leave it to you Gains
What's the matter?
and blooms on the third day.
I tried searching as well but I couldn't figure out which ones were edible at all.
Well, this person might not be sane in a sense.
Oh no, where's the toilet?
Enemy attack!
Everyone wake up!
You don't have to laugh that much.
We should also make a moat and make the walls high so that if the time comes, we can shut ourselves into this castlemansion to fight.
we don't have to do that much.
It looks like it's mostly complete.
Out of our way!
It's great when it's in full bloom.
Oh, that place where a volunteer army took arms and are wiping out nearby bandits.
what should I do to become big like you?
Prepare to die!
It's quite noisy.
Damn you.
an8Not some beauty of the century though...
we took arms.
He went out to battle seven times and lost seven times.
First, we let out small units to provoke the bandits in the fort.
What is this?
Liu
Kong Ming-dono's intelligence surprises me.
Since the moon was too beautiful.
W-what are you saying?
Yes?
Yes, but just a little more.
It lives off dead bodies of animals.
That's why it is called the Three-day Grass but,
I was hungry and troubled, and you know.
Well, this person might not be sane in a sense.
Everyone wake up!
Enemy attack, enemy attack!- lol ry
But this might be a good timing.
It's not that I don't understand your ideas but...
Him as in...
What was that for!
What's funny.
Well, mischief-loving kids reminded me of when we first met.
That's why this village is called Tao Hua Cun with the characters peach, flower, and village.
Duly received.
If you are taking a child it might take four to five days.
Yes, what is it?
Really? Will that really make me big?
Then you will surely become big.
intermission
Stop it!
Wake up Ling Ling.
Damn.
Given name Yun Chang.
Guan Yu-dono, Zhang Fei-dono, and Kong Ming-dono I see.
Umm.
So you won and came back.
Oh, a volunteer army?
Well, we can leave the past behind now,
will you not help me?
I will smash you to nothingness!
Anything wrong with the feast?
But...
and become an established commander.
For that I need your power.
What's the matter?
Look at this.
That's why it is called the Three-day Grass but,
what in the world happened?
The world circled around me the moment I ate it.
Everyone wake up!
Now wake up!
how scatterbrained could you be?
If you see people with weapons wandering around at night you'd mistook them for enemies.
Liu Bei-san, we must be prepared for the worst.preparation prevents grief
It looks like it's mostly complete.
It's like the younger sister's jealousy after having her favorite sister taken.
Snow...
They might have played tricks on you because they wanted to make friends with you.
Hey boss.
Does this village have somewhere you can see flowers?
Would you tell me some details about the volunteer army in Tao Hua Cun?
Let's take this opportunity to show them violence and get those lazy Kan warriors awake.
From what I've heard, uprisings are happening everywhere,
...and that will lead to more people being saved.
"And that will lead to more people being saved" he says...
Oh geez.
What's the matter, Kannu?
No, it's nothing.
However large the number of enemies trying to shoot arrows at the imperial court,
I will have you work as my aide.
What's the matter?
Umm...
It smells weird.
Since it's an herb that grew by sucking what little life Bachou-san had left so,
Firstly, I will have Kannu-dono take command of Chouhi-dono's unit as well.
Nothing.
Ryuubi-dono!
What!?
she says she does not know how long she will be able to last, and asks for reinforcements.
It's all right. The protection should be perfect with the moats and watch towers.
What are you waiting for?
Wha-?
Aisha told me to guard the house while she's out,
From here on I, Chou Yokutoku, will not let you through!
Rinrin, you did well.
Sei, you have to be the one I entrust my back to.
Those who can fight, make pairs and fight a single enemy.
Then I can't be losing here.
Our boss is beaten!
Right!
I'm happy to see you all safe and sound.
Why do you know my name?
That sword, I saw it somewhere...
Everyone, we are ready for the flower watching!
It seems the people in the Kan Dynasty finally realized our greatness.
So that's why they've asked us.
Then, we shall depart tomorrow morning!
Somethings? You mean...
I'm going to go since I said so!
While preparing supplies in case the war prolongs,
So, can I ask you to guard the house?
I hear the revolt happened because of harsh and unjust taxes in the first place.
To forgive the crime of bandits who revolted against the imperial court, that's absolutely too lenient.
Don't be cutting supplies like lazy and beat the hell out of them in one strike.
But striking them from the front is too reckless!
This is a once in a lifetime chance to gain fame.
When you admirably get his headneck,
Wow.
I will have you work as my aide.
Wow.
Right.
According to messengers who arrived just now from the village,
Bear up!
But to fix this chaotic world and save many people, we need to gain a far greater power.
Let me meet Sousou.
Wha-?
That's Chouhi of En.
Your head is mine!
Oh, Kouchuu-dono,
Even though we've conquered most of the other parts...
Sei, you have to be the one I entrust my back to.
Those who can fight, make pairs and fight a single enemy.
Mommy, keep it up.
I'm burning red hot now!
What? It went away?
Geez, why you little.
You will find yourself bound to her bed again.
I'm happy to see you all safe and sound.
Good thing someone like him didn't take your first kiss.
Y-Y-You were watching!?
In the fully bloomed Peach Garden,
Yeah.
So in the end, they are having the General's follower's army come out but,
You have a fever, you cough, and your nose is runny so you've got to have the cold!
They say somethings don't get sick, so this isn't a cold!somethings  baka
Since fools do catch colds, you do have a cold!
Kong Ming-dono, what you're saying isn't wrong, but please be more gentle with the wording...
I'm giving you a mission.
Kong Ming...
Isn't protecting the village too difficult for Zhang Fei?
I hear the revolt happened because of harsh and unjust taxes in the first place.
Don't be cutting supplies like lazy and beat the hell out of them in one strike.
Now...
Horrible, one more glass!a reference to an Aojirua horrible tasting drink CM
It looks like my chance has finally come.
We, the volunteer army, have taken this fort!
Firstly, I will have Guan Yu-dono take command of Zhang Fei-dono's unit as well.
What's the matter?
Liu Bei-dono!
What happened?
Damn!
Liu Bei-dono, please send reinforcements now to the village!
If we gain achievement in tomorrow's battle, I will become a commander in the government army!
W-Wait!
What business do you have this late at night!
Cao Cao, I have something to tell you, please listen!
No!
Begging someone you tried to kill to avenge your father?
That's for you to think about.
That's Zhang Fei of Yan.
What are you waiting for? She's alone. Get her!
Damn, use archers.
why are you here?
Xing, you came!
Xing?
Xing, you have to be the one I entrust my back to.
That shining ball seemed to be some angel from the heaven and...
From that time on, I put on this mask and fought for justice, posing as Kachou Mask.
No, a lie.
You never change, Xing.
As it was an impossible plan in the first place,
Then...
You knocked him away at the final moment.
In the fully bloomed Peach Garden,
It seems the people in the Han Dynasty finally realized our greatness.
From what I've heard, uprisings are happening everywhere,
Everyone, please begin preparations.
Even if I have a fever, I cough, and my nose is runny...
Somethings? You mean...
I'm giving you a mission.
Right. That's how my sister should be.
Get well soon.
I hear the revolt happened because of harsh and unjust taxes in the first place.
By lenient you mean?
Your Honor,
What's the matter?
No, nothing.
Liu Bei-dono...
Bosses.boss and the people,
Keeping good watch paid off.
What's the matter?
The village, Tao Hua Cun, has been attacked by a pack of bandits!
Damn!
Even more so, being Great General He Jin-sama's aide, who's a conspicuous figure now.
I don't know what your justice is but,
Stop it!
For a friend!
Put top priority on helping the wounded.
Wha-?
Ling Ling-chan...
Damn you!
Your head is mine!
Get them from afar with archers.
I, Huang Zhong, will be your opponent in archery.
why are you here?
Yes ma'am!
Bandits!
At one time, a menma-loving traveling martial artist.
Mommy, keep it up.
Our boss is beaten!
I thank you as well, Huang Zhong-dono.
No, a lie.
and with absolutely no winning chance with the great warriors Guan Yu and Ma Chao out,
Oh! He's the bad guy!
Hey, wait up!
That is, well, umm...
what shall await them?
I'll eat them, then.
That's why I said...
Lin Lin, wait. Don't walk ahead by yourself.
Eh?! What should we do?
Sorry about this.
You can stay here until your foot heals.
And...
Shuri, wrap a bandage around her.
What are you saying? You're lucky that you didn't break a bone.
Delicious!
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh? What kind of food can you make?
Don't mention it. You'd do the same for me if I were in trouble.
Nah, that's not what I meant.
I made it so that someone with an injured foot could still move around.
This is convenient.
Isn't Lin Lin-chan a good child too?
She and her sisters were sent from one relative to another.
After that, she ended up at my teacher's place for a while, but eventually I took her in.
The Master said, "To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity;
I've drenched it for three days, but the swelling hasn't really come down.
Sensei, I'll go get the Saronpa herb.
It would be nice if I could go with you, but I have to deliver the medicine that the village at the foot of the hill requested.
Falling over in an empty place, what a klutz.
She's slow too, so I can easily get back before her, even if I pick the medicinal herbs after she's done.
When I came with sensei, she always held my hand and crossed with me.
But...
M-More importantly, we need to pick the Saronpa herb.
There you go.
Um, Chouhi-san.
I'd like to ask you for a favor, then.
Eh, take Koumei-dono on a journey?
I don't mind, but is it all right with you?
I...
Your uniform is like mine, you must be a student of St. Francesca Academy, right ?
We meet again.
Well, the bread for me is this and this...
Give it back to me !
It's because, I as your sister need to teach you, to not being selfish.
Oh my ...
There is one president with 2 generals and one military adviser makes a 4 squad teams.
I told you to buy eel sandwich, but why you bought me the wrong one for lunch ...
This is kind of rude.
You don't need to blame her like this, just because of a bread.
Eh, I should join everyone to participate in student council president election ?
Actually, at the day they returned to the dormitory, they gone out together.
Please, help us ?
This sandwich with ramen's flavour is also delicious.
Now, you only need to write your name in the application form.
Although their temporary troop was gathered from independent members ...
New military strategist, Koumei, can advise at any situation, I'm looking forward to it.
It's a bad situation. Well ...
It can't be ...
On the other side, Kousonsan approves the task ...
Although I don't know, what is written on that paper ...
You, go on !
We don't have any chance to enter the stage ...
The plan to buy eel sandwich for general is completely failed.
I'll start to eat ...
Contestant Chouhi has succeeded.
It bother me a little.
It will be decided in the water horse fight.
First, splash water to wear down the enemy's physical strength.
Let me sing again ...
Don't let them attack !
The big chest in the middle has been forced with a massive inertia.
The finalist are ...
That is not because of interest ...
Do your best, Koumei.
Koumei, I'm sorry for everything.
Then, as additional prize.
See, your necktie is loose.
No, I lost while playing "janken" with my friends. They asked me to buy some bread for them.
Hey, that sandwich is mine, isn't it ?
You don't need to worry about it.
Why why why ?
I want to get it, but it sold out. I should be hurry next time.
Although she want to become student council president, but without mastering the basic ...
I'm looking forward to your effort, Koumei.
But ...
What should I ...
I don't know how ...
Students, prepare yourself for the student council president election.
No one was listening, so they don't know about my existence yet.
Thousand of miles under the clear sky in St. Francesca Academy, here the student council president election, has finally come.
Now let's starts the opening ceremony.
First, please all contestants enter the stadium.
Although her good combat ability, would Kayuu be able to lead all of her weak members ...
And Chouhi, who is separated from Kan'us team, do the military commander.
This time, don't make mistake, right ?
Kayuu's coordination can't kept pace with the team.
What a good combination from Kayuu and Ryofu.
Kayuus team pressure the enemy fiercely, they try to catch up.
The notes, created by the senior general, decide the victory and loss.
Oh, what happens here ...
Sonken borrow the enemy's military strategists to run.
"A man, who can write while he's walking on the night road, doesn't dare to greet"
On the other side, Kousonsan approves the task ...
For Yuan's noble family, it's not a big thing to do.
Although I don't want any people, other than Karin, to see me like this.
Can they make any counter-attack to defeat ...
It's unexpectedly ...
It's a water harassment.
We have to graze the horse quickly.
But, Soukou ...
Allright.
Done ! Kan'us team has succeeded to win in such disadvantage situation.
The big chest in the middle has been forced with a massive inertia.
I'm sorry, you can blame my chest for not being obedient.
It'll decided between both.
And she able to defend the Enshous clan. Here's the clown contestant, Bunshuu.
It's okay, since her appearance is like Chouun's.
Do your best, Koumei.
This could bring us victory.
I see, Reiha can't swim.
If it stay like this, I'll lose.
But why ...
How could I sacrifice you to obtain the Victory.
I'm fine, I'm just a little hungry.
Then, as additional prize.

Huh! Even if she is, there's nothing to be afraid of.

They were calling themselves the "Lin Lin Bandit Group."
After that, she was taken in by her maternal grandfather, who lived in a mountain hut. literally she said "grandfather of her mom's side" but it sounds tedious, so i put "mother's father" -guuwas: a hut on a mountain.
Right now, she's all by herself.
She's just a bit stir-crazy at the moment.
By the way, Mistress.
Hm, a favor?
Today was a big success too!was: It's a big success today as well.
The best!
Bye.
When tomorrow comes, I'll...
That Mistress really worked me hard.
Aisha. Wake up, Aisha.
It's war. Our village is under attack.
O-Okay.
Close your eyes and don't move. Don't make a sound, no matter what.
Found them!
I haven't made many proper meals, so I couldn't help it.
Please clean up the barn as well while you're at it.
Y-You're that one?was: You are she? - no one speaks that way
If I go in on the left, I should just have to follow the road.
Hey, stop that. It'll be dangerous if it hits.
How stupid!
You won't?
Let's go back, let's go back.
Get beaten up by the boss!
You're Lin Lin, right?
I didn't want to experience such sorrow again.
I changed my mind.
It's just right.
Then I'm coming in too.
That's because you apologized properly.
Nope. It's just that none of the people in my bandit group came to see me off.
It must be because I wasn't a good leader, so that's why everyone...
Guys...
People with various desires in their hearts are entangled by the colored threads of fate, and are connected together.
Since you've become my younger sister, you have to listen to what I say.
I'll walk slowly.

Pardon me if I'm wrong, but aren't you the much-rumored black-haired bandit hunter?
W-We're just pledged to be sisters.
So, what does it mean?
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
Well, that's true.
Nah, but I...
Not by a long shot!not literal, but responding to the previous line
But you haven't mastered the use of your strength.
You can't.
Get a hold of yourself! Wake up!
What a high fever!
Are we going to hide in here?
Um, thank you very much for saving me.
It was the natural thing to do.
I'm going to save them, of course.
Got it!
We're friends heading to our deaths together. Call me by my mana from now on.
What about my turn then?
If you keep working under Kousonsan-dono,
Kousonsan-dono is definitely not a bad person, but that's all she is.
Hey, my friends.
When I go shopping, it always takes me there and back.
Hmph, poor thing.
There are scenes I want to forget, and there are also memories I want to forget.
I was only pursuing the truth, but when I realized it, you were there.
Kioku no sumi ni utsurikomu kirihanasenai kanashimi mo

Dont be unreasonable, but have some tea instead.
Be fearless, be unmatched in keeping your eye on it.
Yeah
Yes!
I only just managed to wake up, though, right after having a bath.
but since the bandits entered your territory, it's a different story.
Wah.
That person's head is all wound up.
That person is the notorious Sousou, eh?
She's a formidable person.
We can't fight on an empty stomach!
Now, Kishuu's Number One Martial Arts Tournament is finally about to begin!
The governor-general of Kishuu, head of the super-noble En family, Enshou-sama!
Amazing! Competitor Bachou won an overwhelming victory!
Competitor Bachou also finished her opponent in the semifinals with a single blow!
You're pretty good.
Both of you, stop right there.
In any case, the match you two put on today was really splendid.
Would you like to become guest generals for my En family?
Toshi, bad news!
What is it, Iishe? Don't come barging in so suddenly!
Ah, yeah.
We came from horse-riding bandits ourselves, so we're not exactly suited to judge others, but...
Therefore, I'd like to make a proposal.
If you manage to do that, you two will still be my closest aides, just like before.
However, if you lose...
No, it's not about whether you're good at it or not.
Then do it like this. Isn't it simple?
q0The Kishuu Bird Watching Association's members will help us count the votes.
What are you saying now? It's all or nothing for this match.
Yay, we did it!
The crowd is excited now.
In spite of everything, they need to give me a break on that one.
Of course!
And who are you?
Wasuretai keshiki ga ari wasuretai kioku mo aru
you will definitely be taken a step forwards a new page.
I was only pursuing the truth, but when I realized it, you were there.
The inseparable sadness that reflects in the corner of my memory.

Etsu  is also known as Yue in Chinese. It was a country in ancient China, from 600 BC to 334 BC.
Oh, not particularly.
I'm not sulking or anything.
What's going on?
I'll go talk to her now.
I'm surprised that we're meeting again in such a situation.
Sousou-dono, can you somehow bring yourself to spare Bachou's life?
Yes. Sleep with me tonight, just this once.
You can save someone's life with just a nod.
I will spare Bachou's life as a reward.
There was an invited gathering at Supreme General Kashin's mansion in the capital.
What, this is nothing for me...
My unit found him because I happened to be on guard that night.
she respected that by accepting the unfavorable criticism herself.
I think she didn't sense any cloudiness in your aura and came to understand that you weren't lying.
Kan'u, I am indebted to you.
It's already in the past. Don't worry about it.
Next episode, Koihime Musou, Fifth Feast:

Even if there's a river, don't pay it any mind!
Hey, don't sing that weird song so loudly. It's embarrassing.
We didn't really deceive you.
Bullies are unforgivable!
General Kayuu, you'll live a long time since you don't seem to have any worries.
If not, disasters will befall the village."
But Toutou-dono, why are you doing that?
I don't think it's something an ordinary girl would do on a whim.
What a terrible thing to do... terriblemean -guu
W-Was the monster that scary?
Ah, no, that...
Thank you very much.
Y-Yeah.
it seemed that the sound came from inside a brand-new coffin.
Wake up...
Since the enemy isn't a monster, there might be a reason for her actions.
Yeah. That place is probably her home.
This is the first time I've faced an opponent like this.
All of them were either abandoned or injured.
I felt sorry for them and couldn't just leave them alone.
I'm sorry.
Ah, I see.
I'll try to explain things to the villagers myself.
That's good.
Well, they might be able to keep thieves away if they're trained properly.
Wait... what?
At this time, at this place, it will become my strength and lead me to tomorrow
yi er san
Luxurious and gorgeous, theres no arguing about it.
Yes! Yes!
I apologize for eating your bamboo shoots while you went to the toilet. I'm sorry.
They're delicious.
Bamboo shoots...
Lin Lin, wait. Don't walk ahead by yourself.
Let's go find her.
Yeah.
Hey, Sei!
You're all set.
You might be able to find your missing friend, too.
My name is Shokatsuryou. My courtesy name is Koumei.
Ah, do you mean you want a bigger one?
Nah, that's not what I meant.
Leave it to me.
Yes. That's why, from time to time, the villagers living at the foot of the hill ask us to bring them medicine that she's made.
I see. Koumei-dono, you really are a good child.
Okay!
It's not scary. It's not scary.
But...
She's afraid of heights, so she won't be able to climb all the way up there.
Ah!
Why is she trying so hard?
Just a little more. Just a bit more...
Ah, could you possibly be worried about...
The Master said, "In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but they may all be embraced in one sentence: Have no depraved thoughts."

Be fearless, be unmatched in keeping your eye on it.
One, two, three!
But she's not a child anyway.
Leave it to me at times like this! exact same line as last ep -guu
It was a total disaster.
That's why I'm saying your fortune-telling can't be trusted.
Lin Lin!
Anyway, I'm going this way, according to the fortune-telling.
Does that mean you're going to...
Yeah. I'm planning to win that and get the prize money.
Now, now, now, the annual Big Eating Tournament is finally coming to a close.
The way she eats would even surprise a fierce tiger! Here's Chouhi!
Kyocho is going as strong as ever!
I... I lost.
Aisha said something mean, and that's why...
Nah, it's not about that.
Hey, give him a hard time.
I don't care if you're a competitive eater or an anteater,
Yay, you dug your own grave!
Indeed!
What are you thinking about?
Thank you very much.
What are you guys here for?
Sensei, please.
Hey, I'm leaving this with you.
I don't have a grudge against you guys, but this is my job, so I'm going to give you a hard time.
Hmph, you're the one who's going to have a hard time!
How cowardly!
Hey, throw down your weapons, or else this kid's gonna get it.
You guys know her?
I'll take care of my comrades' misbehavior.
O-Okay.
Yes!
What a weird person.
Speaking of weird people, that weird masked person...
Aisha!
So Koumei-dono suggested that if we waited on the roads near the exits from the city,
Stop drinking and do the preview!
Ah, right.
Kan'u Obstructs Kouchuu's Plot.
Hey Lin Lin, don't walk ahead by yourself like that.
But she's not a child anyway.
Why so?!
It was a total disaster.
But following her fortune-telling won't necessarily lead to a disaster.
Then...
Yo, long time no see.
Even though she ate more than everyone else in the previous rounds, she can still eat like that.
Eh? You lost sight of Chouun, had a fight with Kan'u, and split up?
Well, whatever.
That was close.
Stop it right there!
Yay, you dug your own grave!
You said "shorty" again, "shorty..."
I'm going to crush you!
Then we'll be imposing on you.
Kan'u-san!
I was a wandering warrior until yesterday.
Hmph, you're the one who's going to have a hard time!
Butterfly...
Are you okay with that?
Look.
Why didn't you just go ahead with Koumei?
That's why we have to be together no matter where we go. Got it?
Wh-What's with her?

With such a clear sky, we might run into something good
Hey! What are you doing? Let go of me!
Hey, we only just met. Don't get familiar by calling me Shao.
Ah, nah, sorry.
Ha ha, she called Koumei a kiddie.
This place is nice. Let's eat here.
But there I bought this.
When I saw it in the store, it was love at first sight.
The people from nearby villages who want to take a look have all gathered here.
A guest to see me?
I like to poke my nose into others' affairs, so I couldn't help but drop in uninvited.
What nice weather.
Nevertheless, the heads of the people passing by on the main street look like specks from here.
Kan'u-san, what are you trying to say?
Don't move.
And then, at the meeting place...
What on earth do you want me to do?
What she could see from where she's confined...
P-Please wait. We'll tell you where, but I think it's better for you not to go.
Eh? There's a kidnapped child in the run-down house across the street?
Yeah. In order to save the child, we need your help.
Eh, my help?
three.
Stop messing with me!
Let's go back together.
My mother?
Get off the horse!
Eh, my, that means...

That's right. It's a treasure map.
But is it okay for just the three of us to take a pleasure trip to a hot spring right now?
That's how it is.
Only connoisseurs know about this place.
Sulfur?
I think it's possible too.
All right! Let's set out right away to look for a hot spring!
Since it's decided, let's charge ahead!
You should know that my bed is huge, shouldn't you?
This map has worm holes everywhere.
Reiha-sama, look at that.
Wait, Iishe. We have Reiha-sama here.
It's 34.
Right.
What's wrong, Koumei-dono?
So this is also one of those places, eh?
Nah, but are you sure that bear was the one you raised back then?
Let's study the map and see.
If I see her next time, I'll make her pay for this.
Let's feed her squid and onion till she's scared.
Ah, Reiha-sama, Iishe, look at that.
Hand your map over to me,
That's right, Lin Lin. I understand how you feel, but the other party needs a leg to stand on too.
No, stay back!
Grandmother...
I guess anyone would be narrow-minded if her breasts were tiny.
q0Nevertheless, if we strip ourselves naked, I think our victory will be complete.
Hello, I'm Kakouen.
Your special existence will one day grow into a spiritual bond.

Yes! Yes!
I-I am glad that you have returned safely.
That's good.
and the Son family's name has gained reknown in neighboring countries as well.
Sorry to have kept you waiting, everyone.
Preparations for the banquet are...
If we stop here, we might be able to reign over the Koutou area, but that would be it.
B-But, Sheren-sama...
I already have many times, but right now Sonsaku-sama is giving Shuuyu price of place.
Yes. Arrangements have already been made.
If we let that person become the leader of the Son family,
I can't wait to see Shuuyu's crying face when everything's over.
What are you saying?
H-Hey, Lin Lin!
And that child called Chouhi is amusing too.
Let's look for a mountain bird.
So, what is Nee-sama's condition?
q0At the moment when Nee-sama was shot by the arrow, a traveling warrior of unknown background was up there.
Kannei-san, just now you said you left Kan'u-san's side to pick up the kill, right?
B-But...
Sonken. You're still up?
When you feel like discussing them, please write me a letter.
Kan'u-dono...
Ah, what's wrong, Koumei-dono? Are you seasick?
Yes. Was this incident really just an attempted assassination?
It feels like everything was too perfect to be true, as if we were watching a play...
Let's see.
I'm looking forward to seeing how she'll grow in the future.

I'm going to wash my face.
Are you also part of the Volunteer Army?
What's wrong, Kan'u-san? It's so noisy.
At first, we thought they were bandits who'd gone broke or something, because their appearance was so suspicious.
What?
You bandits who take advantage of these turbulent times to harass innocent people,
who helped Emperor Gaozu of Han, Ryuuhou, to conquer the whole country.
exterminating those bandits will be a piece of cake.
As expected from Chouhi-dono! How courageous you are!
Ah, n-nah. It's just that the moon is too beautiful.
Yes.
I don't think someone like me is worthy to be the master of a heroine like you.
I want to improve my reputation by exterminating bandits, and recruit more soldiers.
What do you say, Kan'u-dono?
Would you work for me?
Anyway, I grilled a mushroom that grew around that area and ate it. Then...
Before I realized it, I was running around the mountain with them, roaring with laughter all night long.
prepare for the worst, and you'll have no regrets.
Just a little more, and it'll be finished.
Why are you looking so sullen?
Even though he's a general, he's a big coward.
Enough!
No, hearing about mischievous brats reminds me of the first time I met you.
Even if that's the case, I'll never be friends with people like them!
Passing through!
Hey, boss.
Peach blossom viewing?
That's why this village is called Touka, and its name is written as Peach Blossom Village.
We'll all come view peach blossoms here when they bloom!
If you do that, you'll definitely grow to be big.
There are scenes I want to forget, and there are also memories I want to forget.

Okay. Since you asked me, I'll stay behind and protect the village.
Yeah.
Lin Lin!
If we attack them frontally, the result will just be pointless sacrifice.
Besides, this time the rebellion happened because the local feudal lord imposed excessive taxes.
Yes, Ma'am. In response to your expectations, I will definitely return with their commander's head.
What's wrong?
Kan'u-dono.
Ryuubi-dono, that's...
R-Ryuubi-dono...
Our chance has finally come.
First of all, Kan'u-dono will also take command of Chouhi-dono's unit.
Damn it.
but they have no idea how long they can hold out.
We need immediate reinforcements...
and it's irritating to have the bandits steal the funds we saved up in the village.
Leave the village to Koumei-dono.
For the sake of our brilliant justice,
Karin-sama!
Strengthen the defenses and hold them!
Break through in one go!
It's time for you to pay the piper, it seems.
Who are you?
But my true identity is...
I can say the same thing about you.
If you can fight, form up in groups of two and attack one target!
You bandits who know nothing but robbing, feel these arrows shot by a person who has something to protect!
I'll convey my thanks to Sousou-dono another time.

It's about time to go home?
Onii-chan, what's wrong?
O-Okay.
Hand over all your valuables!
Don't you see? I don't have any...
Listen.
The village chief is pretty mad about the graffiti from the other day.
Can you leave it to me?
The boss won't lose to you.
You won't?
Ah? What do you mean?
Don't you want to change it?
Good. I will accompany you when you apologize.
It's just right.
My clothes are too small for you, after all.
At most, I'm old enough to be your older sister.
Yes! I got an older sister!
What are you going to do? Are you coming with me?
We're going to the right of the solitary cryptomeria tree.
Or should we drop by the hut one more time?
Nope. It's just that none of the people in my bandit group came to see me off.
Hm?
We'll all be waiting for you to return!
Guys...

Okay, okay.
Even though I'm a minor feudal lord on the frontier, my concern for the country exceeds anyone else's.
Well, that's true.
Can I ask you to have a match with Chouun-dono?
Come.
Kousonsan-dono, I have seen Kan'u-dono's strength with my own eyes.
But you haven't mastered the use of your strength.
But I can't send out a punitive force until we discover the location of their fortress.
I'm going too!
Listen. While hiding in the load and going to the robbers' hideout, you'd have to hold your breath.
Kousonsan-dono, please call a doctor! Hurry, please!
I see, then...
What's the matter?
Huh? What are you saying, Bro?
This place is bigger than I thought.
I-It's not like my breasts were the only thing taking up space.
Yeah. In fact, your butt might've taken up even more space than your breasts.
I'm going to punish you.
This is enough against low-lifes like you.
If you don't care about your life, bring it on.
Lin Lin.
Got it!
Cross to the other side on this.
Let's go, everyone.
This is bad. Hurry!

If you don't at least greet her...
Good workThank you? for coming all the way from the capital to defeat the bandits, Sousou.
but since the bandits entered your territory, it's a different story.
I suffered an unbearable humiliation because of you two.
Karin-sama, how was Enshou-dono?
It disgusts me that a fool of a feudal lord would act so arrogantly.
Shunran, how's the army?
"Kid..."
This job pays the best out of all the ones I found.
But having to address people who aren't my masters as "goshujin-sama" is...
Sei, aren't you a bit too smooth?
E-Eh? I ordered a large serving, so isn't this too small?
Lin Lin, we don't need you here anymore.
There are too many complicated words, so I can't read it.
From Yuushuu in the north to Koutou in the south, from all across the country,
tough fighters have gathered here to compete for the title of the strongest!
while we listen appreciatively to Enshou-sama's speech, let's begin the first match!
Competitor Bachou is currently training to be a warrior.
Then, I'm going to make my move now!
Competitor Bachou also finished her opponent in the semifinals with a single blow!
Me!
Therefore, both of you win.
Well then, everyone, the closing address will be given by none other than me, from the noble family
What is it, Iishe? Don't come barging in so suddenly!
q0Right now, we're Reiha-sama's closest aides, but if those two bring their brute strength...
Ah, yeah.
D-Do you mean beheading?
Eh, fired?!
Now, the surprise Enshou army aptitude test has begun.
E-Eh? What, I can't reach it.
Now, they seem to be ready!
Well then, everyone, please give your scores!
Hey!
Eh, umm, hi. My name is Bachou.

Sui, are you hiding something from me?
That means...
Really?
Eh, really?
Karin-sama.
What is it, Shuuran? What are you laughing about?
Wah, it's Sousou!
Bachou slashed at them all of a sudden, so they got mad and arrested her.
I heard about what happened.
I never expected to run into her in a place like that.
No way...
Regardless of her reasons, she made an attempt on my life.
I'm fine. More importantly, go after the assassin.
I will spare Bachou's life as a reward.
Sousou-dono!
I will definitely stroke that beautiful black hair of yours,
There was an invited gathering at Supreme General Kashin's mansion in the capital.
Batou-dono, what do you say?
It's disgraceful to a warrior family for someone to die from falling off a horse.
With such a clear sky, we might run into something good
Villain, you said... I'm just...
Eh?! A swindler?
Pay. For the one who swindled me.
Got it?
Eh? You used all of your traveling expenses to buy that?
Because I wanted it.
I'm glad it's not damaged.
Geez, what are you doing, you idiot?!
Most likely, the arrow caused a strong shock wave that knocked the bird unconscious as it passed by its head.
But is that possible?
so there's nothing for you to boast about.
No matter how you think about it, it's strange for a princess to stroll around alone, showing her belly button.
There's no way I, Shao-sama, would snore.
I see. You're the one from yesterday.

Instead, there was a letter.
And then, at the meeting place...
It all depends on your reply.
No matter what the reason is, I think it's unforgivable to take someone's life from the dark.
But...
Eh? There's a kidnapped child in the run-down house across the street?
Hey, stop saying that weird stuff.
What's wrong?
They've successfully distracted the guards.
Wh-Who are you?
What did you say?
Right now we're out of time, so please hurry.
Riri-dono, we're going. Hold on tight!
Since things have turned out this way, I have to take a chance.

Nope. I just think you're more interesting than Kousonsan-dono, after all.
How mean, deceiving me like that.
I'll show you the shortcut. Not to the village though, but to heaven.
R-Really?
Can I?
Besides, people aren't happy, since the price of everything has gone up.
"Have food ready in the temple outside the village tonight.
A human could not possibly have lifted that rock.
But Toutou-dono, why are you doing that?
Someone else said it had sharp fangs and horns.
Eh?!
Hm? What's wrong?
Oh. Please do, then.
Please. The villagers are worried.
O-Okay.
J-Just leave it to me!
It does seem like something is going to appear.
but perhaps I took a wrong turn, because I couldn't find any houses, anywhere.
You finally appeared.
This guy is strong, but...
They continue in that direction.
I want Szechuan-style noodles and a spring roll.
Do you know how worried I was before I found out where you were?
I serve under Toutaku-sama, the governor-general here. "here" as in where she's pointing at -guu
By the way, Ei-chan,
Ei-chan, the other day you said that of late, the city's public order had deteriorated

There are travelers here, but one of them is seriously injured.

I'd like to ask you for a favor, then.
That's why I've thought of letting her do the same thing too.
No matter how strong she is emotionally, going on a journey by herself at that age is...
But going on a journey was the only wish she ever told me.
She can't hear from here.

Now, now, now, the annual Big Eating Tournament is finally coming to a close.
The way she eats would even surprise a fierce tiger! Here's Chouhi!
Kyocho is going as strong as ever!
Th-This is bad. I'm reaching my limit after all.
Ah, all the food I've eaten in this tournament up till now is passing in front of my eyes like a revolving lantern.
You're the one from back then.
My name is Bachou. My courtesy name is Mouki. I came from Seiryou.
Nah, I'm not as good as that.
I don't care if you're a competitive eater or an anteater,
Nee-chan, these people are in the midst of traveling.
What are you saying?
We asked these people to stay over in gratitude for saving you.
Kan'u-san!
I'm really sorry to make you help me with that.
By the way, what happened to Chouhi?
What do you mean by "kids"?
Yeah. Regardless of Chouhi, I'm not a kid.
Nice, nice, nice. Even though I thought you guys were kids, the three of you are heroines.
Even though it's three versus one...
Wait a second. What are you thinking?
Lin Lin, Bachou, it's been a while.
I don't know such a weird person.
Well then, I'm going to get lost too.

Remember, when we entered this city, we were examined closely.
Geez, why did four of us have to squeeze into a two-person room?
That's...
Gratitude for yesterday?
There's no need for that.
If the guards didn't consider that possibility, they can't be blamed.
Yesterday, someone from the gang brought them here as proof that my daughter is still safe.
Why did she draw this picture?
Kouchuu-dono, I promise I'll save your daughter, even if it costs my life.
Hey, anything abnormal?
There's no way I, Shao-sama, would steal something from you.
What?
Hey, hey. Something interesting is going on.

Finish her!
Let's leave the questions till later.

Looking for a new hot spring?
Okay.
Since it's decided, let's charge ahead!
That's true, but...
Or perhaps you're... jealous?
By the way, Keifa. We've already walked a long way.
Reiha-sama, look at that.
As expected from someone with an intelligence of 32.
Ah, it's here.
I'm thirsty. Let's do this after we get a drink of water from that river we passed earlier.
I'm going too.
Me too, then.
I wonder where they're going as a whole group.
Right.
One, two, three!
Nah, I think I heard something.
Strange phenomena always happen at places like that.
Lan Lan is the bear I raised in the past.
so I had to let it return to the mountains.
I didn't expect to meet again in such a place.
If I see her next time, I'll make her pay for this.
It seems those people are also looking for the treasure here.
It's 34.
No, stay back!
Reiha-sama!
Listen, I found this hot spring.
Hmph. Even though you found it, I'm sure it was by accident.
Yeah. She said something that sounded jealous.
But our army is overwhelming in term of quantity.
q0It does indeed suit Enshou's army of battling idiots, who care only about quantity and not quality.
Linking huge breasts to an inferior brain is an outrageous theory!

Sonken-sama really can't see beyond what's right in front of her.
It's true that the continuous wars of the past few years have exhausted the citizenry.
In the end, we wouldn't be able to get our hands on the whole country.
Yeah. You speak as though you'll die before fulfilling your ambition.
Meirin, you'll walk the path beside me until I fulfill my ambition, right?
War, war, war. How many times has it been this year alone?
The Changjiang River  is the longest river in China and the third longest in the world.
What are you saying?
Geez, what on earth were you thinking?
Do you have any idea how worried we were?
They all have their belly buttons exposed.
But Sonsaku...
apparently my younger sister has caused you quite a bit of trouble.
Close your eyes and don't move.
And in addition, my chest feels heavy.
Yes. They've already had breakfast.
Kan'u-dono and Chouhi-dono have gone with Shoukou-sama to the hunting ground on the hill.
Really? Then that's all right.
Koumei-dono said she wanted to take a look at the library, so Rikuson is showing her the way.
You said it! Should we have a contest to see if there's any difference or not?
That'd be most welcome!
It's not trivial!
Is it true that Nee-sama was attacked?
An arrow?
Kan'u, Chouhi, we're taking you into custody.
Kan'u-san tried to assassinate Sonsaku-san?
Then why?
It's not!
We're the ones who won't let you get away with insulting her without any definite evidence!
I understand that you're disturbed because of Sonsaku-sama's collapse,
Kan'u-dono, I'm sorry.
Could it be Nee-sama is...
I've been aware of that from the moment I decided to walk the path of conquest by carrying out my mother's last wishes.
Take her away.
but I didn't expect Sonken-sama to catch an assassin that didn't really exist.
Yes, I will.
Kan'u-dono.
I totally lost my head and put suspicion on you, an innocent bystander.
Stop right there! Insulting a warrior like that without definite evidence...
Hey, I don't care if you're a section chief or a vice chief, the episode is already over.

Eh, ah, thank you for that.
To see Ryuubi-dono return with a victory, I really have lived a long time.
All right. Retreat!
Okay.
Ever since Kan'u-dono and the others joined the Volunteer Army, we've won battle after battle.
Ah, n-nah. It's just that the moon is too beautiful.
Please don't tease me.
I want to improve my reputation by exterminating bandits, and recruit more soldiers.
So this is where you are!
There are more wounded people lately, because of the continuous wars.
Well, as I said, my traveling cash ran out during my warrior training.
Everything in front of me started spinning round and round.
I need to pee.
Ack, where's the toilet?
Nothing, nothing.
You don't like Koumei?
Hey, you brats!

What are you saying?!
I said I'm going, so I'm going!
Chou Yokutoku.
Everyone seems to be here.
Well then, let's begin the strategy session.
we'll admit that our current policy was mistaken.
No matter how many tens of thousands of enemies rise in revolt against the Imperial Court, I won't be scared.
I will appoint you a general of the government forces and make you my aide.
Ani-chan, I've seen how to change this world. Please look after me.
Oh!
R-Ryuubi-dono...
You'll be punished if you don't drink it gratefully.
That unit will be the vanguard. Bachou's unit will follow in the rear.
The village...
Damn it.
For justice's sake, for my sake, won't you work for me?
Yes, right away.
Lin Lin-chan, are you planning to go into battle in your condition?
Lin Lin-chan...
Hey, why are you so scared?
Surround her at a distance and kill her with arrows!
At times I'm a messenger of beauty and justice, Butterfly Mask.
Lin Lin, is your cold better now?
Actually, after I lost you guys, I died after being hit by a shining gem that dropped from the sky.
Eh?!
Listen, that man was...
That means...
Aisha, we will always, always be together from here on.
What beautiful black hair...
Oh, so today's the first day you're attending our school?
You should always keep your appearance orderly.
But...
My pride falters because I cannot stop the swirl of my hesitation.
Your special existence will one day grow into a spiritual bond.
So, Koumei-dono, I'm supposed to buy...
So I had to buy their bread, too.
Speaking of which...
Hey...
Oh, sorry.
No, the conger eel sandwiches were sold out, so I couldn't buy one.
and air leaks from my belly button at a critical time...?
The Student Council Wars?
No, this academy is just a bit different.
People form teams of four, with one general,
There's no need to scold her so much over matters of bread.
Look at Sonsaku-sama, she didn't look for work
Don't bring my sister into this!
I don't care what happens to that disobedient tiger of a girl.
We beg of you!
Um, you can have it if you'd like.
...is calming.
Now, now, sis...
The Graceful Queen, Sousou!
Bringing militaristic tyranny and inhuman atrocities,
Kayuu has lent the team her fighting strength for her own reasons,
Rikuson's appearance is drawing attention away from their ace strategist, Shuuyu.
is dropping in unannounced!
However, the mysterious zebra strategist intrigues me the most.
Now that the principal has graced us with his words,
...the Kan'u Army and the Toutaku Army.
The most important thing in a three-legged race is synchronization.
Let's go! One!
Desperate times call for desperate measures...
Amazing! The Kayuu-Ryofu team is simply amazing!
Now announcing the results.
It can't be...
On your marks, get set...!
This is a one-on-one match between commanders!
N-no...
That I was the woman behind the mask.
The Sonken Army achieves the victory.
We didn't get any screen time at all...
It can't be... did the Enshou Army get there ahead of us?
I didn't want to show myself to anyone but you, Karin-sama...
That twisted girl's played a dirty trick with those makeshift coverups...
i1Here's a bonus for you, so look again
All right, Shoukou-sama?
No, that was no wardrobe malfunction.
The centrifugal forces around her chest became excessive.
Then, because they suddenly reversed the rotation...
That Shoukatsuryou girl is a force to be reckoned with.
This round will determine the Student Council President.
Featuring the newly-joined "Ha-wa-wa" strategist, Koumei, is...
It's okay. She resembles Chou'un closely enough.
Do your best, Koumei.
Just a little more, keep up the fight!
At this rate, I'll lose.
I won't be selfish anymore.
You're a good girl, Rin Rin.
East, south, west, north, anytime and anywhere,
Be fearless, be unmatched in keeping your eye on it.
Ah, something you want to show me?
Ah, that means this is
Ah, nah, that's...
Well, well. There's a saying that the more money and baby diapers, the merrier.
q0Just like when commanding an army, one must be flexible in dealing with everything.
We've been unkind to Shuuran, leaving her behind to take care of the place all by herself.
Sniff, sniff.
What are you saying? Dashing ahead is the essence of battlefield tactics.
But this is a hot spring!
What's going on? Geez...
We can't use it this way.
Slick?
I wanted to get into a huge bath, too.
Looking for a new hot spring?
Yes.
Hey, w-wait, you can't just...
Karin-sama, is it all right to make that kind of an agreement?
No, that's not it.
Wh-What are you saying?
Of course. This method conforms to the best thinking of pseudoscience.
Toshi, I feel like we've been walking around the same area for some time now.
Ah, but I'm sure it's around here... I think.
Damn that little girl for getting in my way again.
Wait, Iishe. We have Reiha-sama here.
Do you have to do it now...
Me too, then.
It seems they found it.
I wonder where they're going as a whole group.
Maybe to the toilet? Don't we always go together too?
What's wrong, Koumei-dono?
Hey, the hot spring still hasn't emerged yet? I'm bored.
Yes.
Tiger, tiger!
As proof, Lan Lan has a tuft of white fur under this armpit...
I'm the one without a leg to stand on!
That's right, Lin Lin. I understand how you feel, but the other party needs a leg to stand on too.
This place is...
The real ones were close to me right from the beginning.
Because I've found something that's more important than treasure to me.
Hmph. Even though you found it, I'm sure it was by accident.
I guess anyone would be narrow-minded if her breasts were tiny.
No. Karin-sama is number one in sensitivity. Right, Karin-sama?
Everyone with a featured role seemed to have fun.
My apologies.
I heard that you'd been injured on the battlefield, so I panicked.
Sonsaku does this to improve the Son family's reputation.
Daikyou and
Shoukyou,
Ah, so this is where you are.
And yet, Sonken-sama is...
What an ominous thing to say.
I'll definitely seize the country with my own hand.
I already have many times, but right now Sonsaku-sama is giving Shuuyu price of place.
Choushou-dono, since things have turned out this way, let's carry out that plan as soon as possible.
Oh, that means finally...
Kan'u...
apparently my younger sister has caused you quite a bit of trouble.
Because I drank a bit too much last night.
Yes. I love books.
Books are good.
You said it! Should we have a contest to see if there's any difference or not?
Ah, Sonsei-sama.
Nah, it's the opposite.
"Supposed to be almost dead," eh?
I knew you were displeased with the way I do things,
I leave that to your imagination.
However, Respected Aunt, no matter how much blood I have to spill, there's something I want to get.
Yes, everything went smoothly.
Rikuson-san, me too.
We couldn't settle it the other day,
Ah, what's wrong, Koumei-dono? Are you seasick?
I don't know why, but I have a feeling that she'll stand in our way one day.
You don't need to sing. Leave already!

For you, I'm not going to lose! All Right!
Decided? Whatever do you mean?
Everywhere in this wide place is nothing but flowers desu!
Well, it seems like you are misunderstanding the situation.
You may enter. After all, the whole reason you decided to come here was to meet her, right?
Contrary to someone like you...
... please come to our Cattleya Castle's fifth conference room.
That might actually work.
When dealing with Higashi Kazuna, you do not need to worry about her breaking her word.
Then let's go home.
In a hurry, it seems.
That's just like Tetsurodesu.
Tetsuro-san is already at that age, that's why...
Lady Hexokazura, how are the sister's preparations?
What is this?!
Hey you! What are you doing?!
Those five council members are really troublesome, wouldn't you say?
Well, it can't be helped. Higashi Kazuna is the superintendent's granddaughter.
She's up there flying!
You can freely fly about the sky as you wish.
Heavens Finale! God Sonic!
If you want to scamper away as a failure, I'll show you some charity.
No way! It can't be!
Hifumi, you dummy.
Without a doubt, it has to be... his doing.
Looks painful.
Anymore than this will be unforgiveablenya!
Saying nya nya!
Well, going in order, I thought a black panther would be nextnya.
Wonderfulnya!
He's too quick.
What's this? Aren't you being real honest?
Mia-sama?
I would leave this place... is what I decided in my heart.
One time, two times... No, even one hundred losses!
I understand!
What is it, Lady Hexokazura?
A Miracle.
But I'm still all right!
I wished I could hurry up and become an adult.
So I could be useful to him, is what I thought.
My expectations were naive.
The children still do not know their importance in this matter.
Thank you!
Right.
Y-yes, of course it's delicious.
I have been complimented on the first time making bentoudesu!
Yayoi-chan...
That's not how it was supposed to happen, right?
Shall we go the ocean?
Just the two of us?
The equipment has not deteriorated.
For our Goukou Academy's blood and spirit I can't let you off!
You have got to be kidding, you were the one who started this!
Yeah! Roger that!
All the systems in the protection grid have been compromised.
Can't you stop the energy from rising anymore?

Before he plots the coordinates, we have to do something to stop him.
Ok, that should buy us some time.
Tetsuro-san, I'm sorrydesu.
our promise together we will protect!
Could you please bring our princess here about now?
Our master has ordered us to borrow Asuka Yayoi for a short time.
I am addressed as HexoKazura.
HexoKazura?
Celonius chaperone.
Don't get in my way!
Wait right there.
Our Gantai-chan?
Understood.
Thank you, HexoKazura!
Time-space oscillator systems have all synchronized.

It's beating so fast, Oh No! It's out of control!
Um, Mia-sama... The superintendent hasn't exactly left us...
Please come to the battle bridge!

He hasn't changed a bit.
What's the meaning of this!
Direct assault engage!

I thought this time might be the end...

Unfathomable.

All kinds of possibilites.
Ok!
Come into the hotspring with Yayoi togetherdesu.
Ooohhh myyyy G---!
Always with these guys. Jeez.
Wait till the last minute before blowing the snow.
From below, there are the hotsprings of Hell. Up above, there is the freezing blizzard!
Those girls have already fallen into our unescapable net.

Aim around the group in a figure 8 pattern.

Let's make a start!
For you, I'm not going to lose! All Right!
Today I'll be giving those detestable outsiders a complete and thorough beating.
I've been waiting so long...
Now that I think about it, Yayoi-san was up pretty early today, wasn't she?
Then, Sakuya-san must be with her, right?
Say your prayers and get out of my face.
We're hit!
S-She's cute...
Hurry up and have the recovery team recover my Seydlitz.
Please make him feel at home.
Now, your seat will be...
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Asuka Yayoi-chan...
Even so, to think that that stupid boy was a transfer student...
Principal, Tanaka Tetsurou has arrived at our school.
In that case, try it on me.
On top of that, adultfiction...
Ah... I won't be able to become a bride anymore...
I will always, always, protect you.
Asuka-san, I've had you investigated...
Kazamatsuri-san... Chouno-san too!
It's okay.
Are those two friends of yours?
Koi Koi Seven!
Tetsurou-san?
Emergency combat procedure, Defcon 1, declared.
Then this means war!
Miya-sama, now!
Please follow my instructions.
Okay.
Rocket Stream Attack!
No!
Tetsurou-san!
For ever ever so long I've love, love, loved you.
Where I'll be living from today on, Anoyoroshisou.
That's how things are, so try and be friends with everyone.
Even Kanou-sensei.
We don't need a wall between us.
From now on we'll be in the same room!
There is an empty swing set
I'll do it!
Strike a pose, Ready To Fight, Let's Go!

Tanaka Tetsurou, today, you shall pledge obedience to me.
Affirmative.
Yay! I'm so glad you're safe!

He probably went to the toilet.
...but I believed that you'd be alright.
And so you're asking how this fits in with their plans?
Pa'ching.
Pool. Pool. Swimming!
That lot...
We can still make it to class.
In the event that I'm victorious.
As pretty as a flower.
I... I can't...
Everyone will be trying their best for you.
You can't be serious...
Miyabi-chan, just a bit more.
Yayoi-chan... your face near there... Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub...
That's right!
It's no good... This school just isn't normal...
What's wrong Tetsurou-san?
Does your tummy hurt?
But, I just want to be together with you.
Tetsurou-san.
Tetsurou-san.
Alright!
You're definitely... not normal...
I just want to be together with you.
It's kind of perverted...
Who judge and give...
The Gokou Five.
Prepare yourselves.
Then what did I suffer for today...?
Their voices calling out for help.
While there is evil in this world.
Although, I won't accept it anyway.
Do you like this kind of robot?
Being combined is a combining robot's ultimate form!
Eh, it's not moving?
Akio-chan, Hifumi-chan and Otome-chan,
The following people
will for the next three days
Are all searching for a shore to land
Raise and spin it higher, the circus of your dreams
Now, let's go old man!
Strike a pose, Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
"My! It's tough..."
Good at pretending not to notice, aren't you?
My heart's racing, about to explode.
Eh? Where is it?
Do you want to come there?
Tell us...
...a powercord is...
...the one who was on the news this morning, the Burusera Mask?
I've heard your cry for help...
...due to circumstances Red only, has arrived!
D-damn it...
...as Kino Ranger Red, how could I have been so careless...
The hot-blooded squadron, Kino Rangers.
The water is so cold.
...I really couldn't do anything on my own.
...by that girl.
I...
Tetsuro-san...
We have do things right this time.
I-i-it appeared, didn't it?
Just what is this?
Alright!
What do you intend to do next, Miya-sama?
The three of us... what should we do?
Impossible to comprehend.
...and so all of the girls within the academy were humiliated.
Even then, I still have to do it!
Farewell!!
...is indeed very strong.
At that time, I think I'll know...
Yes.
Yayoi-chan...
Ah, Tetsuro-san... - You're suffocating me, Yayoi-chan.
...has no time for things like love!
If you don't...
Are all searching for a shore to land
The lost memories...
...where they both walked, the quiet city...
Having been looking at...
"My! It's tough..."
It's beating so fast! Oh No! It's out of control!
Shiny Boy, I'll knock on you...
In that case, why don't we take a bath together?
Ah... all of a sudden... I'm still not mentally prepared...
Anyway, time for a bath.
Otome should still be at school...
Make absolutely certain Otome doesn't get wet.
As expected.
Tetsuro.
I...
With Otome-chan it won't happen...
Ah... that girl...
Standing here without an umbrella.
But...
Did you hear that? He called her 'Otome-chan'.
Of course, there's no way I could converse on Otome-chan's level...
It's a bit difficult to walk like this...
Wait a minute, all of you!
Taking a break once in a while is necessary...
...besides, if we're together with onee-sama, that's more than enough.
As I thought, Gokou-kai isn't the same Gokou-kai without Miya-sama.
As though it's the hand of a robot.
Ah... that was so troublesome.
Just a little...
An abandoned puppy.
I don't understand.
But... do you think that was really the right thing to do?
There was no other choice.
I... was... very... hap... py...
Why, Tetsuro?
Calm down.
...I had done such an irreparable thing...
As expected from a synthetic cyborg body made by the organization...
Or something like that...
The next problem is...
So because of that, Sakuya-san has shut herself in her room?
Otome knew that she'd get wet... when she gave the umbrella to this puppy.
As I said, it's a joke.
It's not funny at all!
Of course I'm angry...
...and if we don't keep backing up her memories, they'll be lost.
...you shouldn't force her to remember things.
I'll also say "incomprehensible"!
I'll leave the towel for the dog here!
No... you can't do that...
You can't do it there either!
...quickly warm me up...
Next time...

Sakuya, Otome!
I want to talk to Asuka-san alone.
"Onii-chan", huh?
What are they talking about alone?
Tetsuro!
At this rate, the academy will be destroyed along with Celonius 28.
But when the syndicate began to understand what Asuka Yayoi was,
Ara?
Roger.
and a heart can be reinstalled.
Why is this happening?
Why do you cover her?
I won't let anybody hurt Tetsuro-san!
Just like us.
Please make it come true:
and I cannot walk straight.
Reset?
It doesn't matter to you, does it?
little children,
No. I don't see anything interesting.
It's almost done, so wait a bit.
If you're raising vegetables you never get a day off.
Morning!
But Gantai-chan isn't here yet...
We're not sisters.
I see...
No I don't know her.
Tetsuko-san, every time I think of you, my heart aches...
Onee-sama!
Me too my beloved petite soeur!
A splendid suggestion! Brilliant as always, Kazuko-san!
How perceptive for a kid!
Draw, draw!
Probably...
Gantai-chan?
Gantai-chan!
NO! I won't!
Then she got really mad...
While he still got Asuka-san!
Is it yummy?
Butter?
See ya!
Tetsuro-san! Welcome back!
I worked out a lot today so it's really good.
We all discover the first morning through a thousand nights
A Miracle.
I sit on a bench when nobody's around,
She has been so conceited for a while now.
Just shut up!
Hifumi-chan Dance! The One Day I Wanted to Sing... Desu! The Pink Colored Sigh!? Episode 10
I wonder if he fell out of his nest?
That Hifumi... I wonder if she's going to be okay?
The only people who know that, are those two themselves.
WHEE! WHEE!
Gantai-chan! Until we arrive, be more careful!
Warm and steamy desu!
That's great, eh Yayoi-chan?
Yes desu!
Ah! No... That is... I haven't...
Could you move?
I... can... see...
Oh, so Tetsuro-san is an animal, is he?
Yesterday, Hifumi-oneechan came here, I am sure of it.
Well then, the cause of Hifumi's change,
The yucky taste of the tea is hidden inside the flavor of the coffee. It's delicious, this drink!
Do you know what terrible things happened?
This is the worst, jeez!
Inside the photography room... I have confirmed Hifumi's existance...
I got it!
I'll return the spandex.
Hmph!
Akio-chan flies in the sky!
You're doing great, Gantai-chan! I'm counting on you.
OK, next!
Incomprehensible.
Hey, hey. Are you two really going to do it?
Ah... This is... um...
Acting childish might seem like being a failure?
Ah.
Yes.
This position offers the best incoming reception...
For real.
Otherwise that Hifumi will lose her memories for real.
I never once said it would be our school uniform.
You're terrible!
Iidabashi-san, Why are you doing this?!
They'll say Inokai Hifumi is a cosplay loving freak, don't you think?
Hifumi?!
I don't want it raw!
What's that?
Gently swinging, the pendulum of dreams...
Please make it come true:
extermination I am putting all my cards towards your destruction!
This must be the Kamakura festival!
That dirty girl! Kidnapping Gantai just to call us out here!
Higashi Kazuna... Kidnapping people! Unforgiveable!
A sleazy baboon is what she is!
That might actually work.
Excuse me, everyone! Is it really okay, leaving Gantai-chan?
We gotta go pick up Gantai-chan.
There's no way it will happen.
Tetsuro-san is already at that age, that's why...
Lady Hexokazura, how are the sister's preparations?
It looks pretty deep, don't you think?
This Poseidon suit's power... study it wellaru, you know.
The island was blown up!
Surprisingly insidiousaru, right?
Hey you! What are you doing?!
Sato-san!
Wait, Yamada-san! Not there!
On the other hand, this isn't the Sky Dominion, but instead is the mountain lands.
Amazingdesu! Surprisingdesu!
Today I'll have my blackboard-resentment revenge!
That is?!
That's impossible!
Unforgiveable.
Hifumi, you dummy.
It was for that purpose you contacted us.
Unfathomable.
Cosplay, right?
Evil will never be allowednya!
I am not putting the blame on you at all.
On the other side of that door is where Gantai is being held.
What's wrong, Otome?
I admit defeat to you.
Even if it's to the ends of the earth, Mia-sama is who we will follow!
What is it, Lady Hexokazura?
Raise and spin it higher, the circus of your dreams
Tatertotz presents Episode 12 Yay us! Yay us!
and I cannot walk straight.
"My! It's tough..."
Come On And Ready go!
For you, I'm not going to lose! All Right!
My expectations were naive.
Just for Tetsuro-san, Yayoi made this with all her heartdesu.
Orders confirmed, Mia-sama!
Asuka Yayoi-san...
for me...
--don't want to die...
There is no way I'll excuse you!
Opening up the gate and connecting it to our space-time coordinates, who knows what will happen?
Why? This is just absolutely weird!
Me and Miyabi will stay here and handle this.
Yayoi, take Tetsuro with you and escape!
L-E-T-'S GOOOO!!!
Now is the time to go, Yayoi-chan.
Yeah, it's the truth.
It's a promise.
It's confirmed he brought Yaku and Shou?
Yes, please.
Formerly, he wanted to be the one to open it wide in the first place.
Right now in your present state can you defeat these two?
Even humans seem to be intelligent at times, right?
Let's go, everyone.
Our Gantai-chan?
Asuka Yayoi is most likely being held inside of Cattleya Castle's lilian garden.
If you're going to do it, aim for that moment to strike.
However, if they exert their full power then...
All of you will be...

It's opening! The doorway!
Hey you...
Yamada-san what are you..!
It's a matter of what's in your heart!
What's the meaning of this!
What was that, you know!
Well, then we shouldn't be on this island?
Want to play! Want to play!
Otome has froze up!
Well this was... unintended.
You all are such cowards! Get back here!
This should be good.
I wonder if I can keep up with everyone... Inside those mountains..?
Yamada-san!
That way!
All kinds of possibilites.
This is no time to be doing that!
Y-yayoi-chan!
Is it not about time for the finishing victory?
I understand. My lady warriors, Gokou five, sortie!
Don't think this time will be like the other useless attempts.

All Right!
If you want to, could you please explain it to us?
So that's how it is.
Could it be, Chouno-san...
...so get in it before you catch a cold.
Ah. That's quite thoughtful of you, Tetsuro.
...we can't catch a cold in the first place.
Then I'm counting on you.
I'm home.
I...
...she was a very cute girl.
Suspicious!
Wait, Yamada-san, you're far too close to me.
Is that embarrassing?
Satou-san is so cute.
Not that one. Your shoulder.
It's not a good thing.
Taking a break once in a while is necessary...
Otome-chan...
Why do you say such a thing?
T-that's not true!
It wasn't Tetsuro-san...
Certainly, it was very cold.
Huh?
Tetsuro... treated me as though I was a normal girl.
The next problem is...
...washed away.  oshinawareteiku 
To get lots of energy, meat is very important. Here!
Miyabi, please prepare the evening meal.
Of course I'm angry...
I'm glad...
...all of these memories are lost.
E-eh... Ah... O-Otome-chan... W-wait.
I too... don't know why.
It's just that...
Otome-chan...
No... you can't do that...
I can fly, You can fly

Yea, 'that' gotta be it.

Tsukuyomi-san!
Anyhow, Tsukuyomi-san seem to be really popular among girls.
Miyabi-chan is the idol of the academy.
Intelligent...
Please relax, Miyabi-chan.
Speak in a louder voice, please!
Is your cold really okay?
Tanaka Tetsuro
Say, Satou-san...
Why are we doing this?
He's mine.
The physical struggle between the bikini babes has begun!
Ahhh!
Koi Koi..
It's amazing
I bet it's something stupid.
With the idea coming from that big head...
Round 2.
Like hell I would.
But I will allow it since it's only first offense!
This ain't fair!
Uh-oh.
Ready, begin!
Charge!
Isn't that cheating?
I'm telling you that it's not fun at all.
Sigh.
Yup.
Here we go again.
Why?
Don't mind.
Huh?
Thank you, Tsukuyomi-san.
Anyhow... what exactly was that?
Tetsuro... you're kind, aren't you?
Now, calling me out to a place like this...
Can't be...
In cinema, the will of the director is absolute!
It's definately not fine!
Huh?
not only my responsibility, but my management skills will be questioned as well.
But now that we've decided to do this, we're gonna do it.
Aim for Cannes! Aim for Venice!
Sigh.
Uh-huh.
Sakuya-san, please!
Hm?
Sakuya-chan, what are you doing?
See ya!
What is this supposed to be?
It is my policy not to voice myself in front of colorless film.
This is nothing but a fault of the production manager.
Not even giving us what you were supposed to, how are we expected to do anything?
Ehh... Such reckless words!
Well, let's forget about Higashikazuno's policy in this case.
Flunked... flunked... flunked...
I can do it.
Hghh... one week.
My name is Poophead Kazura. Remember to write it in kanji.
Why do I have to suffer like this?
Next is your turn to make my wish come true.
But... Sakuya-san?
There is only-one way for all of you to crawl out of here...
Got it?
Sir, yes sir!
This is the last batch.
I'm burnt...
Tetsuro, film.
Sakuya-san, are you all right?
Well done.
Sensei, what happened to Sakuya-san?
I'm not gonna let their sacrifices go to waste.
Here she comes.
Forget about it.
It's ecchi!
Aim for Cannes! Aim for Venice!!
She became a student at this school by sneaking past the system's security and altering the data.
Tetsuro-san, do your best!
You can call me "Onee-sama".
I had no idea that exchanging ribbons was proof of friendship.
Then Tetsuko-san.
Not really...
I offer prayers during those Masses too.
That she's praying every Sunday at Mass.
Asuka Yayoi.
Higashikazuno-san is really a good person?
Are? Tetsuko-san!
Asuka Yayoi!
But Yayoi-chan, I'm amazed you found me.
A friendly person directed me.
Am I not good enough for you?
Yes.
Then...
That will do, right?
But isn't that an indirect kiss?
Jeez, get out quickly.
You pervert.
That's a proof of friendship at this school.
Then stop.
I'm really sorry.
No...
You really do intend to interfere with my love.
It's dangerous to be here.
Ararara!
Tetsuro-san?
Lemme see...
She won't be able to escape that crowd of girls.
And so...
It'll be OK OK! They'll never figure it out.
But if there are no indication that Celonius moved on their own...
I feel guilty.
From a long time ago...
She's the girl in black who told me where you were earlier!
Yayoi-chan!
Then I can be Asuka Yayoi!
Tetsuro... come.
I'm Ryouko! I'm Chuuko!
Tsukuyomi-sanI
Yamada-san!
What a bad girl.
Well, Otome?
She's not like you guys.
Nothing will change by doing this.
Why?
What?
Is she?
She has no memories of what happened up until now.
I'm Tetsuro.
Reset?
Come on...
No way.
Alright, it's time!
It sends shivers up my spine!
Onee-chan, what are you watching?
to fully grown friends,
From its nonsensicle story developments with no rhythm what-so-ever, Rangers yelling "Mom!" and that's what the kanji says
Gantai-chan?
Nothing really.
Hey,
It's almost done.
Morning!
I'll go too.
NO!
We're not sisters.
Huh?
Chuuko! Shut up!
That's a pain - just take her to the police.
Uum,
I believe that this would be an excellent chance to show the lower classes your unrivaled ingenuity, influence, and compassionate heart.
Gotcha. Point up!
Miya-sama, calm down! Calm down!
I see.
I think that Celonious 28 was special to him.
I believe the best option now is to carefully watch her.
Are you OK?
I see...
Tanaka Tetsuro is on a date with yet another girl!
This is terrible!
Hey, by the way, what's your name?
I see.
Jeez, we were really worried!
Incomprehensible.
A gentle light filters in through the trees,
and lie down to dream,
a book of poems in my hand.
Eh, no way. It's not like that at all.
Mia-sama. Is being silent like this okay?
Tetsuro-san, are you okay?
Tetsuro-kun you're an... Animal!
Photography Room
Akio-chan, where did you go off to? I'm lonely you know.
Over there.
What about my underwear...?
I never once said it would be our school uniform.
What are you...?
Katsuko-chan is fired upAru!
Nobody will be coming to save you now!
You know...
What's wrong, Hifumi?
I came back without Gantai-chan!
This is so fun!
It's time to decide this for real!
i1We've decided to break up.
An unfaltering elbow.
It's just an hour by car.
So... You want to break up?
Huh...
Don't worry, I've got it.
q2Why didn't you check what food they're serving in advance?
i1I can't force her to come with me.
I had hoped you'd ask!lit. "I'm so happy!"
Yoji!
Just one last time.
I did do my research, see?
I grew up in the mountains, after all.
i1Ask me.
i1No, that's not it at all!
I guess so.
i1What was the point of the past five years?
Huh?
i1If he'd been more cruel to me,
Yup!
No way...
i1when it came to the things I really wanted to say,
Hey, so...
And these are yours.
It's supposed to rain in the afternoon.
That's a long way away. You worry too much.
I don't really care about sculpting.
It took me a while to decide,
Yeah, she did.
You can't do that!
You can't just keep it a secret!
I've just never had a proper look.
And I couldn't really see it...
You like... what?
That's obvious!
It's pretty intense looking on this close.
Some would sing of love, others of their parents.
Maybe it really was better not to tell him.
In that case...
 Go away.
...less than I expected.
q2means wanting to be closer to each other than anyone else, right?
Did it have any contact information?
Well, I'm not, but...
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
Yup. My 130 yen.
You like machines, right?
Thanks.
Pretty please! I want to go up!
Oh, please.
i1And not just nature,
i1You've never been this adventurous...
Right, that thing.
I'm not a pervert, okay?

q3The public safety commission and the general affairs commission in cahoots?
q3Well, if this goes public, Katahira Faction will fall apart.
Come on, you'll be late for morning practice.
Will you go out with me?
You're here early today.
Normal.
People's names are important!
What? Weren't you listening?
However and wherever.
I'm sorry. It slipped my mind.
Don't worry, it's just me being picky.
You don't seem all that sympathetic.
Big news! Big news, everyone!
q3It's all right. If I could get fired for something like this, I would already have.
Disbanded?!
harassment towards financial aid students.
was you, Student Council President Mouri.
That would be to transfer duties to the next administration...
q3Do you not feel that the president's resignation would be a loss for the school?
Th-That's...
q3The clubs that have no achievements would face budget cuts or be disbanded
to reduce overall school expenditures.
The Action Figures Club that I'm in
an8They all cost a lot.
The finance commissioner hasn't been elected yet.
Please lend me, Tatsumi Moheiji, your support in the upcoming election.
Oh, yes! My apologies!
I-I can't... stop...
Please make way!
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?
We'll run against the finance commissioner.
Who's going to run?
There's no handmade feel to that.
Sounds professional.
q3And then I fold it over heat with gelatinizer and polysaccharide thickener.
Non-chan will support you in every way she can!
Right? Don't you agree, Morishita-san?
q3So it's unanimous, huh? I had no clue you were so popular, Yuu-kun.
Congratulations on your marriage!
q3Reality is too tough, so I'll settle on finding nice girls in the world of dreams.
Cut the nonsense, and wake up already!
It's Sunday, but we still have a club meeting!
Long time no see.
Oh, Matsuri-san!
See you!
Well, it's not like people bump into pretty girls that oft
Eh? Oh, sorry!
What is it?
I'm honored you understand.
Yuuki-senpai is quitting? What is this about?
What are you talking about?
Where did you find it?
It's called the Food Research Club.
Don't worry about it.
Stay put!
Just let him go.
You running in the presidential election, Oojima-kun.
Don't you think this is a good chance?
...Nero-nero Machine?
I made it even more powerful!
an8Bowjima? I'm Oojima.
an8What do you mean by, "Bow" anyway?
an8Was I wrong?
an8Yes, you were!
an8The chain came off.
Why do you intend to disband the Food Club?
I don't think it qualifies as a club.
You're not even devoted to the club.
That much is obvious.
Thank goodness you didn't break up with Chisato.
Yeah.
Agreed!
When we're actually voting...
What is it?
I'm counting on you.
Hooray!
q3You're just gonna have to humbly accept the result of this fair election!
Is it good?
Next time, Episode 3: "Strategy."
and I will be acting as Campaign President.
an8That's where all of the bubbly candidates pop.
an8They're the weak candidates.
You've grown.
It's only natural that I'd grow.
That's because Oojima-kun has the potential to pass the primary election.
On that point, the Food Research Club, which would be disbanded instead of just receiving cuts,
But if the General Affairs Commission proposes the same policy before us,
And I'm sure some other people will put votes in for us on the day of the election...
Deal!
Yes, me too.
an8Don't relax just yet.
but don't involve my kids in your skirmishes.
Take care of them.
Precisely.
No one else wants to,
There you have it.
A pro...
Yes. A committee that supports Yuuki from behind.
This and this is...
Let's see...
Make this part more concise and easier to read.
Come on!
If it turned out those kids of mine were in trouble because of me, I don't know what I'd do.
Well, there was this thing with her bike...
I said I wouldn't do that!
You're welcome.
You have my support!
The factory's closed today,
I have two little brothers, so I would be out of school to work otherwise.
We don't have any money, after all.
Apparently, the Finance, General Affairs, and Public Safety Commissions
the three administrative organizations
Yeah, it really was a nice smell.
Indeed.
If it came to light, any victory would be null and void.
5,000 yen?!
Fluffy sponge and fluffy cream in complete harmony!
How much do you think you could earn with the Oojima Roll?
Even if I skip classes to bake the whole day, I won't be able to make more than about 20!
Direction?
Campaign goods?
Yes!
Just to be safe, take it to the Election Administration Committee for approval.
But there isn't enough time to make all 3,000 of them by hand.
Why is it called Harihari-kun?
I'm a teacher, so I can't help.
These guys are running just so they can sell stuff, huh?
We have a champion! Isn't that enough of an achievement?
Wh-What?
Never come back again! Go! Go!
The presidential election and my work are unrelated.
The club reform isn't solely for budget reduction.
Huh?
Um...
Reform of the financial aid system?
But we got all those done on time, and we're almost done setting up the booth.
Why me?
Wh-Why are you strangling me?!bg
Tell me!bg
so she's able to talk casually with anyone.
I'm really grateful.
I'll do my best to save the Food Club she holds so dearly.
Yeah. We'll do our best together.
Those were the names of a witch and her daughter on an old TV show.
I'm a year older than you, remember?
From the ramen ad with dancing cows.
Go on.
But you just pronounced it as "Ooshima"!
Correct my name first.
That's all for the interview.
That makes eight.
How are you holding up, Mii-chan?
Yeah!
Well, I swung by to see you produce some sticky, white stuff.
Delicious!
You really are a true-blue friend!
I can't help it! I'm busy!
Yuu-kun, could you do me a favor?
That again?
Please keep things moving!
Give me ten of them!
This looks ridiculous!
No less from the General Affairs Commission.
They'll be tough to beat.
Tough to beat? This guy?
All right, guys. Let's do this!
Oojima...
O-Okay! I will.
Oojima... Pamphlet.
Oojima Roll!
It's okay! It's just my swimsuit!I'd rape her
Say, "Open up!"
I'm counting on you guys!
Guess we have no choice.
Yuuki, you're up.
Yuu-kun!
It's fine. It's Yuuki's fault for forgetting.
Thank you, Mii-chan!
Kiss!
aims to preserve the freedom that club activities currently have.
Yes.
so I won't be able to support you afterward.
Should that happen, I'll be there to guide you.
Mr. Tatsumi, you're up next.
I wish you the best of luck. Until next time.
Good work!
Yuu-kun!
Far be it from me to stop you.What's wrong with his face?
an8Kiba-senpai, what's wrong?
an8The speech she wrote is about to be read aloud in public, after all.
Never!
Are you feeling okay, Mifuyu?
The reason for these inconsistencies can be attributed to
She's got a big mouth.
How scary.
revolutionary changes need to be made.
I'll have to give the speech while reading from it.
We can't!
My name is Oojima Yuuki!
I just have one thing to tell you guys today!
I call it the Seven Food Club Vows!
Earlier today, primaries for the Student Council President election were held.
an7With the voter turnout at 98.4 percent,
so usually this would be it for the qualifiers.
First is the independent candidate Oojima Yuuki.
Now reporting live from the Food Club room, Mr. Oojima's campaign office,
That's eight percent of the votes.
that a candidate unaffiliated with
20 of 140 votes, huh?
99.3 percent of the votes have been counted!
Or at least I'd like to.
We did it!
Hooray! Hooray!
Garage and I prepared this.
No, don't be sorry!
We'll make good use of this money!
Our future depends on it!
Hooray.
Good job today!
an8We have an entire election ahead of us.
It's so overwhelming, though.
I can understand how you could feel that after seeing these numbers,
The iron votes for each candidate.
The votes held by each party, which will not go to any other party.
I think there are a lot of people who gave him the vote just for fun, though.
S-Stopping bleeding, huh?
I'll do the dishes, so you guys go relax.
Huh?
q0I never knew the campgrounds had an open-air bath!
Yuuki!
Does it still bother you?
We might get dizzy.
Don't you want to look at my naked body?
Seriously... I can't even get any peace and quiet in the bath?
I'm really sorry.
an8Just how many alarm clocks do you need?
You feel so nice!
Sensei!
Come on. Let's get back to the campsite.
I can't go back!
But guys aren't allowed beyond this point.
Shh!
Shh! You're gonna wake everybody up!
Hold it!
Outlawjima-kun.
I'm sorry my sister dragged you into this mess.
q0I'm starting to believe that the two of you have a special relationship.
Is that a fact?
Fine.
I see. I get it now, more or less.
And you're not against it at all.
Am I right?
Thanks so much.
But what should I...
q0I prefer Western confectionery when it comes to sweets.
I mean, I'm so defenseless right now.
Just kidding.
Of course not.
How did he just disappear?
an8How am I going to get out of here?
The reason she left home?
She just holed up at home one day.
She did?
Yeah, I'll ask Sensei about it when I have a chance.
would you treat that as just an accident, too?
U-Um...
Sorry, sorry.
Test of courage?
Now, let's go give school ghost stories a try!
What excuse?
That's not what I said.
What were you two up to?
I was with Hazuki-sensei.
But she got so drunk that she passed out, so I took her to her camp dorm.
Looks like we caught up to you.
Hm?
U-Um, well...
Should I do it now, then?
Hey, Satsuki?
You're so easy to read.
Ever the pure maiden, huh?
Stop.
Still think you can win?
Knight to 4I, promotion, check!
I got stitches and turned out fine.
q3Th-Then you and Shinonome-san are blood-related and share the same two parents?
I'm the mistress's child.
No one's blaming you, Satsuki.
Oojima is quite the troublemaker.
That goes double for the enemies closest to us.
You usually get cravings for sweets when you're thinking hard.
and make you sleepy due to hypoglycemia.
Daiki?
What's wrong, Yuuki?
Huh? Oh, nothing.
Get up already, Yuuki.
You could've just had Yume do this
Huh?
Match? Do you mean the shogi game from yesterday?
That's not what I'm talking about!
Why are you so angry?
I just said that I'm not!
Why did it take you forever to bring those flyers?!
Huh?
Go... Change!
Waking up early was worth it!
Wait!
Got you!
Shiohama-san!
I'm ready any time!
Normal.
If you put it that way...
I want you to power the equipment!
Yeah.
I will...
Hey!
It was so bad that she stopped coming to school.
Is that the girl involved in the Oosawa Incident?
had shoplifted from the school store.
while the Food Club is getting shut down?
What is it?
Is that what you really think?
Then why would you add a policy like that?
Huh?
Financial aid students are the minority.
But there are people being harassed as we speak!
We need to bring attention to this issue as soon as we can!
What?
Don't leave me behind.
I tell you this all the time.
So, will he?
What's up with that data? Why is his approval rating so high among the girls?
That's the Recycling Club's car.
Um, can I see it?
The vast array of flavors amazes me.
Okay, are you ready to go?
Mommy needs to go to work soon.
Eat it.
Here, eat it.
Here!
How is it? Is it good?
Huh?
So promise me!
Yuu-kun is okay, so don't cry.
an8He really needs to take care of himself. The election's in full swing, after all.
an8I-I agree! He was so careless and made everyone worry.
Liar.
Eat it.
That's exactly it!
Why? You said that you'd stay with me!
Oojima, not a happy color.
is pretty personal.
Sorry. I took it with me by mistake after accident.
What was that song?
She gave it to me.
I came to Takafuji to find Kana...
President, what's the matter?
Oh, please excuse me.
Please don't touch on matters concerning financial aid students in this election.
an8Huh? Haida-san?
an8I'm so sorry! Did it hurt?
an8so I'm here to see an ophthalmologist.
Where?
i1A deal?
It has nothing to do with me!
i1From the Oosawa Incident?
What's this?
There's no point in subjecting him to this.
I've made a grave blunder.
However, there's no going back once you hear it.
q3and provide the Public Safety Commission with intelligence.
What about the kind of snacks you dislike?
We use spies to provide a safe environment at this school.
The amount of money that moves through this school can reach tens of billions each year.
We believe that she was targeted while investigating something.
She is currently receiving treatment at a hospital
an8One of the conditions for admitting her into the hospital
The same way you heartlessly refused to eat her chocolate.
How do you know about that?!
After losing her brother, Sumiyoshi-san has been depending on you for support all her life.
Hmph.
How did you know?
What happened to the missing halves?
Leave me alone! This was missing not sure what'd go nice for this line it's  you ioryogi
Stop!
Chisato...
Mifuyu!
Do you understand?
Oojima?
Security level raised to maximum.
Excuse me!
I was so lonely without you.
I looked everywhere for you.
I thought Yakumo-senpai stopped supporting him.
Could you call in S-chan?
an8Ooshima getting elected might be more than just a dream!
Right, Campaign President?
Did something happen between the two of you?
Don't do this to me, man.
Huh?
According to a recent poll, 50 of people surveyed like Western sweets,
If you want her returned to you unharmed, do as I say.
That's barely enough time.
Kana-chan?
Yakumo!
an8I remember...
Where the hell is Yuu-kun?
You didn't tell her too much. Very good.
q3Things are looking bad. The drawing to decide the speech order will begin soon.
q3I hear you suddenly took Kana-chan out of the hospital.
Don't you think it's miraculous?
q3I mean, they were actually saved on the memory card,
Oh, no. Look how late it is.
Sorry, but I have important business to attend to.
He'll be speaking last!
Great job!
The speech will last for thirty minutes from 11:30 to 12:00.
q3Yuu-kun's ratings are dropping, and his supporters are turning to Tatsumi Moheiji.
q0It turns out our executives had connections with the General Affairs Commission!
It's nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for a true reform!
Please locate those two.
Seriously?!
Make sure the girl keeps her mouth shut about this.
Are we clear?
q3We found pictures of a Public Safety Commission member in the Katahira Faction
You didn't listen to Katahira-senpai.
So you were dealing with them all along.
It truly is my fault for appointing you.
What happened to the election?
Huh?
Yuuki...
Do you hear yourself right now?
You have to believe in yourself!
Just get on, you two!
Hello?
I learned what it takes to win an election.
and that I can do the right thing after I got elected.
And that's the fact that I love all of you!
an8Normal...
But things will only get more difficult from here on out.
I'm sure being a Vice President is a lot of work.
Hey, wait up!
What's the rush?
Don't go back to sleep!
an8I did it because Yuuki showed me something weird.
q3This obviously isn't "normal"! What part of her are you talking to?
Good morning, everybody!
It's all the same to me, Ooshima.
So what do you think, Yuuki-senpai?
However and wherever.
All right, all right. Enough about Yume's marriage.
It's white.
Wh-What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Shinonome Satsuki-kun.
q3Do you know who would be the next president
W-Well, I believe the vice president would be acting president until the next election.
q3That's from the finance commissioner, Shinonome Satsuki!
She has big boobs.
Hazuki-sensei, do you know the finance commissioner?
General affairs commission...
There's no other alternative.
Look.
It's just a sign of my appreciation.
Eh?
or putting your hopes on a slight chance.
Hear that, Yuuki? What about you?
What?
Soon,
the election will begin.
Fold, fold, fold it to death!
You said that you'd help.
Yeah, give up already, Ooshima.
Next time, you'll be the one coming to our wedding!
"Love"?
Even though it's so close?
It's not close. I can't reach it.
an8"I won't let you go!"
He said that he's quitting the Food Club.
Oops, I meant, Oojima.
Here, you dropped these.
You apologized again.
Um, I mean... well...
Use them efficiently.
What is it?
See you.
Well, that's because...
Yes, hello?
My body's not enough for you now?
Senpai, please calm down and listen.
You know...
Let's see...
Oh no, I have a club meeting to attend.
It's called the Food Research Club.
Yuu-chan's quitting the Food Club? That's too much for me to take!
Non-chan, could it be that you...
This is...
My apologies. I seem to have bumped
Ouch!
But President...
It's a very natural choice.
You like blueberry flavor?
It's not that easy to create achievements.
The club will disband if I don't run, huh?
Let me see it.
There we go.
It could be worth a try.
But it's through the Food Club that I came to meet all of you.
and we would laugh and mess around. It was really fun.
Everyone, please vote for someone who can really win the election.
It earned Non-chan's endorsement too!
Good luck.
an8If we don't pass the primaries, we can't run.
an8You need at least 10 percent of the vote to pass the primaries.
An alcohol allowance would be nice.
Cash allowances might lead to corruption,
What?
But why me?
That's correct.
They would also release their manifesto to attack Shinonome's weaker stands, too.
However, we can lend you the know-how regarding the election that we've acquired.
That's quite the accusation.
We won't let you down.
Oojima-kun.
Yumeshima-kun, let's do our best together.
Sure.
I don't know what you're up to,
I would never.
Can I believe you?
We're not handling that first?
How are we going to do this without a manifesto?
In your visit, please bring a female club member.
There are many clubs with more males than females,
so it'd help to have a female student there to smile and make the request.
There you have it.
Yeah.
I'm just getting started.
Isn't that your job?
We want it to form as a volunteer organization.
It'd be a simple task for the Finance Commissioner, wouldn't it?
So, you wouldn't mind firing me privately?
I gave you the money, didn't I?
Time to eat.
It's impossible as long as you keep up that look
that gives away how much fun you're having teasing me.
But I still don't get why I did something like that.
Well, I still want Yuu-kun to make me dinner,
Good night.
What the hell is this?
W-Well, yeah.
You're going to be the Student Council President.
Maintenance for the school.
It's fine!
They're just harassing
What a sublime scent!
S-So do I stink?
Aomi-san, you don't stink at all.
Apparently, the Finance, General Affairs, and Public Safety Commissions
the three administrative organizations
Even with a low unit cost, you still require a large sum of money when appealing to the masses.
And before long, the bazaar became the main event.
Goods that leave an impression will help people remember your name.
How many do you need?
All right!
Just to be safe, take it to the Election Administration Committee for approval.
The Election Committee gave their answer.
People might take it the wrong way if they fall off, so we have to stick them on firmly.
Oh? Then for the time being...
W-We have to put labels on all of these?
Why is it called Harihari-kun?
multi-hand massage manipulator!
Let's do this!
Oh.
I don't think the financial situation of
The club reform isn't solely for budget reduction.
There are still so many left.
Oh?
You know someone that amazing?
I...
Shinonome Satsuki's manifesto...
But we got all those done on time, and we're almost done setting up the booth.
Aomi-san!
Sorry.
Something other than bread crust!
an8This is also my chance to repay Chisato for the favor she did me.
Those were the names of a witch and her daughter on an old TV show.
That's not what I meant!
"Thank you very much for listening."
Yeah!
What about you?
Yes, I am.
I can't help it! I'm busy!
Pay more attention to Chisato.
I want both of you to be happy.
an8Oh, that's our president for you!
an8Guys!
Just what you'd expect from the Finance Commission.
So obvious...
It's in return for them being the president and VP of your support group!
Please line up here!
The newest one and England x America!
Two sets of snakes and crabs!
O-Okay! I will.
It was the right choice to have those two sell goods.
Can you two link arms?Their outfits seem familiar
Oojima Roll!
What's with them?
For what?
Those interested should come to the EAC office located below the stage.
Here you go.
Oh, I mean, I'm in love with someone else.
Too bad! There's no place in her
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
an8Only a few more copies of our newest book are left!
an8What am I going to do? What am I going to do?
an8Kiba-senpai, what's wrong?
holds a plethora of unaccounted expenditures.
While the President makes the final approval,
was there ever a dispute regarding the budget planning?
Did they ever oppose the President's decisions?
Giving their speech next is the candidate endorsed by the Finance Commission,
Hey, you're back.
But the truth is that both the receipts and expenditures are extremely unbalanced right now.
both the school and student body,it's a 3 liner this should be shortened there isn't any pause in his speech so it'd look awkward to split
Huh? Was this the speech?
I am determined to make bold changes!
I didn't get to review it in the end.
Wait!
Good! Now that we're all friends...
The polls will close shortly.
Now I've done it.
an8Who knew it started from a lamb dish?
It was far more moving than what I wrote.
Excuse me.
Huh? What are you talking about?
It's a different person?
But this year, Yuuki's in the race, too!
Now we will be introducing some candidates the ASP picked up on.
They probably haven't even touched the votes from the seniors yet.
A good chunk of the seniors vote just for kicks since they'll be graduating,
Shirakawa Ayame had 8.6 percent last time, but now she has 8.8 percent!
The thing is, he won't be.
How are things looking there?
You're not just projected! You exceeded the requirment!
Or at least I'd like to.
602 votes!
Well, the rumors did say this would happen.
Thanks so much, you two!
Yeah, you'd better!
It takes a lot to scare us!
spaghetti, which has 100 grams of flour per serving,
That's scary!
I pray that all those calories go to my boobs!
I still can't believe how well things are going!
See you tomorrow!
Sure.
an8However, this is just one step in the process.
With this, you should understand the harsh reality of our situation.
You can easily get those 3,000 votes if you sway the voters.
One hint lies in Shirakawa Ayame, the candidate who nearly qualified yesterday.
How would doing that sway people to vote for you?
q0What would happen if you also called yourself a revolutionary and competed against her?
He really feels like a capable man.
A-Are you okay, Yuu... ki...
Thank you very much.
You can't keep your little brothers waiting.
Look at me.
We might get dizzy.
What's wrong?
Why?!
Why won't you go?
Oh, you two are pretty close, aren't you?
You already kissed me, after all!
I need to use the bathroom!
You don't even have anything left.
Take me to my room!
I can't eat any more...
Don't let him get away!
Get him!
What's the matter?
No, I don't know anything about this.
I see.
No, not that we know of.
Okay, we will!
Sorry for disturbing you.
You're not exactly in the clear yet,
Shinonome-san...
Why are you so close to my sister?
I just want to know the truth.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
You're worried about what she might do.
In the end, you care about my sister.
But then I'd be bothering you even more.
You're the one making me do this.
Are you sure?
q3Non-chan says, "Early to bed, early to rise," so she didn't notice, either!
but it's actually pretty dangerous, huh?
Now, let's go give school ghost stories a try!
A Japanese toilet?
I was with Hazuki-sensei.
I'm not going anywhere.
You understand that, right?
an8Then Shinonome-san saved me
You're trying to avoid this again?
Huh?
q3Beat me and I'll even tell you what you want to know as a bonus prize.
I wonder which of them you take after.
Did you know? Her mother is the second one.
Good for you, Satsuki.
Ouch!
When my late mother became unable to bear children,
But I can only remember her showering me with love.
and my confusion turned into rage.
So I left.
A dream?
What are you staring at?
as a result of the incident involving Commissioner Oosawa.
If we allow any other commission to ascend,
Isn't that...
Huh?
so it doesn't really matter who won, does it?
Yup, it's just as she says.
I'm not discussing anything election-related with Shinonome-san!
See? You're angry.
Oh, you!
Thank you.
Attention, everyone!
Waking up early was worth it!
Sure it is!
I have a very special job, just for you two!
an8Oojima...
And item three:
Eventually, it grew too much for her, and she stopped coming to school altogether.
The system deploys financial aid students to work at cooperating companies
q0Financial aid students aren't doing anything to deserve harassment!
I want to end the discrimination against financial aid students here at Takafuji Academy!
I almost mistook the Dog Pot Club for dog eaters.
Is that what you really think?
Not that! I'm talking about adding the financial aid student issue to your manifesto.
But I can't just neglect the issue, now can I?
I'm right here with you.
Yes. His interests match ours.
That's not what I mean.
Huh?
Yaoemon.
I must say, it's quite the original character.
Here, eat it.
Hey...
I don't want it.
i1I don't want chocolate.
I'll give you chocolate!
I'm not going anywhere.
op
Yuu-kun is okay, so don't cry.
I see.
Is it true that Oojima was involved in an accident?
an8I-I agree! He was so careless and made everyone worry.
Y-Yuu-kun. Are you all right?
I know! I know what you're getting at!
Please!
Who am I to you?
That's why this isn't love.
I won't eat it anymore.
Not as Daiki-kun, but as Oojima Yuuki!
I-I'm back, Morishita-san.
Welcome back.
Because our President isn't coming?
That's half of the reason, I guess.
Did a person named Kana teach you?
I see. You must've been good friends.
She went missing?
She wasn't feeling well, so she's taking the day off.
Huh? Y-Yes.
an8I'm so sorry! Did it hurt?
I'll see you later!
I accepted your conditions!
This was a legitimate deal!
I am a former Public Safety Commissioner.
You're ask about how much I know about Kana-san, right?
What are you people doing?
Less than admirable?
Would you like me to continue?
I've already told you far too much for you to go back.
Next time, Episode 11: "Investigation!"
So you're fine with anything edible. Got it.
We use spies to provide a safe environment at this school.
so everything has gone well so far.
I'm coming in.
I don't care.
an8Katahira Faction?
So you're saying I should have just watched as she died?
If, one day, Sumiyoshi-san came to terms with Daiki-kun's death,
You need to see him for who he is.
Are you holding yourself back for my sake?
I think Yuuki's into you just as much.
Please, don't say any more.
Now he's gone.
Mifuyu!
I'm sure Daiki-kun is happy.
Kana's situation is confidential information that few know, even in the Public Safety Commission.
I'm sorry I put you through all this.
That way, our partnership won't have been for naught.
But you've got a few things wrong.
Because...
I may need to dispose of you.
Then what's with these numbers?
an8You were at the top of the polls for a moment!
an8Ooshima getting elected might be more than just a dream!
Ask Mifuyu.
Excuse me, but would you two happen to be a couple?
What?! A coup
Reminds me of when we were smaller.
Yeah.
Dammit. What the hell is...
Who is this? What do you want?!
q3Also, don't speak to anyone about what happened today.
an8taking pictures of a backroom deal.
I knew you'd be here, Yakumo-senpai.
Can you hear me, Yuu-kun?
Hello?
You've got me wiretapped?!
Sorry for leaving you alone.
Oh, no. Look how late it is.
You're... Shiohama-san?
so that I could collect news anywhere.
What happened to you?
It's nothing.
Oojima-kun, isn't today Election Day?
Seriously?!
Now this is the last one.
This is Oogibashi Kana's smartphone.
q3and a General Affairs Commission officer engaging in a backroom deal.
q3And last, but not least, we found a picture taken with this smartphone
And the financial aid discrimination?
At this point, Oojima Yuuki has no chance of being elected.
You're more important to me.
You're safe... I'm so happy...
Where do you think you're touching me?!
I'm Oojima Yuuki.
No! You'll be disqualified!
I... I must first apologize to all of you.
Raising campaign funds, creating a positive image for myself,
but I was opposed.
I can tell from how you're all listening to me talk to myself without leaving!
It's even more fun to watch this change color!
an8Is this leftovers-on-rice flavor?
q0an8It was a very unusual approach to an election campaign.
You're right.
q3I'm so busy fixing the holes in the President's sloppy policies.
Did you get to talk to Daiki-kun?
Yeah. I told him everything.
You're so rude.
a big party to celebrate saving the Food Club.
There it is.
It's hard to mess those up.
We'll be using a simplified recipe, though.
You became a member of the Food Club, so you'd better obey!
Regardless, you're the student council president.
I guess you have a point.
Excuse me!
I had a feeling that you all knew each other.
I have an idea on how to settle this.
I've got your back, Sacchin, so don't worry!
I'm getting a strong feeling of dj vu.
All right, let's get started!
Do your best!
I will!
Yeah, you're never like this.
are you trying to get good at cooking for your beloved Oojima-kun?
S-Stop it, Matsuri-chan!
I know that!
Oh! It's all melted.
 I don't get to have Western sweets very often, so I'll make some now!
I can see these charms because I know all there is to know about Japanese sweets.
Western sweets, of course!
That depends on how much effort you're willing to put into this.
I knew you could do it!
With this, right?
You can wear those for the time being.
I'm so sorry.
Oojima Roll, my specialty!
but it wouldn't be fair to only judge what the two of you made.
So this is the Oojima Roll!
This is leagues above anything an amateur could make!
Exactly! I'd be too embarrassed to listen to you comment on my cake.
G-Good luck!
We aren't getting anywhere, so I'll decide who goes first!
Sacchin and her cake will go first!
Well done!
No need for that.
Shinonome-san...
Oh? You haven't tried them yourself?
Wait!
Come on! Pick up the pace already!
That's some pretty cheap "justice."
One, two!
There, there.Good boy.
Yuu-kun, I'm flattered,
but I'm in love with someone else.
Can we go now?
It's not something we should do in the middle of town.
You're here early today.
Normal.
Pink? Chisato, you're wearing pink today?
I didn't do anything.
It's all the same to me, Ooshima.
Non-chan left the switch on her latest invention,
You can eat my Yaoi Stick at your leisure.
However and wherever.
We got two great smiles.
Normal.Yeah it's different from the earlier translation. If anyone can get both lines parallel and have neither instance sound odd, then by all means
Ouch, that hurt!
Yeah, so unfortunate.
Yup.
Shinonome Satsuki-kun.
q3has many other issues and unaccounted expenditures.
in the cultural festival held twice a year!
Come again?
This... is a prepaid card for the school store.
Please lend me, Tatsumi Moheiji, your support in the upcoming election.
q3No, the election hasn't officially been announced yet, so it's not.
No way!
I-I'm sorry, are you okay?
Ah...
You're right, that's a courtesy bus for financial aid students.
She must work in a factory after school.
In any case, I don't want to vote for that Tatsumi Moheiji guy!
Not necessarily.
Non-chan concurs! The Food Club must go on!
Next time, Episode 2: "Hopeless."
Wait!
Hey, wait up!
What's the world coming to?
Judging from the thickness, it's around two million yen.
All right, I'm off!
It's morning, Yuuki.
Oh, you're still not gonna listen, huh?
an8You're such good friends.
but I'm in love with someone else.
When you go home, you have an all-you-can-eat supply of your company's snacks.
Excuse me.
Let us begin with number one, as usual.
This is white chocolate-flavored.
Yeah, I feel bad.
There we go.
but have yet to fulfill that duty.
May I have the floor?
q3B-But the public safety commission, with which the president is affiliated,
and report the settlement.
q3That's from the finance commissioner, Shinonome Satsuki!
an8No, I don't have a propeller.
an8We FNOS also have full color,
Yeah. I mean, she's my sister, you know.
They're totally different!
If it's not a candidate from the general affairs, finance, or public safety commissions,
q3No, the election hasn't officially been announced yet, so it's not.
Eh?
Not necessarily.
Are you fine with the Food Club being disbanded?
What?
Sounds professional.
Why me?!
Back then, I didn't really know what love was.
an8What are you doing? Pervert!
and hence I am not running for the election either.
Oh, Ooshima-kun!
Sheesh.
Oh, we met yesterday!
q3I gotta go! Um, I'll thank you properly for this another time.
q3U-Um, if you don't mind, could you tell me your name?
an Oojima Roll?
It's not Ooshima. It's Oojima!
Let him go, you two.
President?
But...
Oh, are you running in the presidential election?
I think the best solution would be for you to make up with Yuu-kun and bring him back.
I can't really eat it.
Non-chan, isn't that a bit too much?
an8That's...
an8It's not okay!
Clean it with this.doesn't work irl
So...
However! Since I've decided to run, I want to really try to win.
Me too.
I don't want to lose it.
q3as you think about the person who would have the best chance.
It convinced me that you'd do well if you run.
I-I dug my own grave!
We're finally getting things in order.
We've gotta make flags for our speeches.
Let's make posters first.
an8the school will hold a primary prior to the actual election.
an8That's where all of the bubbly candidates pop.
Free Yaoi Sticks.
Huh? Y-Yeah.
Let me be frank.
Yes.
The Public Safety Commission
So, if an independent like Yuuki is elected president,
Yes.
And I'm sure some other people will put votes in for us on the day of the election...
Regardless, you shouldn't be so haughty to someone offering us help.
The President isn't doing this out of kindness of his heart.
It's possible that
We won't let you down.
Monzennaka-san, I look forward to working with you.
Kiba-san.
I would never.
How are we going to do this without a manifesto?
Yes.
I'll do the job if no one else wants to.
Well then, can someone else handle obtaining signatures?
They would, to some degree, feel bad about lying.
That job sounds just as tedious.
Yes. A committee that supports Yuuki from behind.
the Finance Commission and the General Affairs Commission.
Come here for a sec.
Even if we have different mothers, I'm still your beloved sister, aren't I?
It's a decision I came to after a thorough examination.
If it turned out those kids of mine were in trouble because of me, I don't know what I'd do.
Oh, how you've grown.
I must become the Student Council President that you couldn't!
an8Man, I'm exhausted.
Let's have a fair election.
Until next time.
Then how about dating me?
S-Stop that!
so I'll be careful to not get on your bad side.
You're welcome.
Good night.
P-Please help me!
Were you looking at those?
You're amazing, Oojima-senpai,
Um, do I really stink?
Senpai, please!
Not at all! In fact...
Oh, nothing.
What?
Club funds are for club activities only.
q2filling your mouth with its heavenly sweetness and refreshing scent!
It's super delicious!
How much do you think you could earn with the Oojima Roll?
I'll handle the rest, so you just make 20 Oojiima Rolls.
You can put it up and get it wet.
We get them from Yume for free!
It has the candidate's name and key issues. A very good pamphlet.
The Election Committee gave their answer.
People might take it the wrong way if they fall off, so we have to stick them on firmly.
all of this will take ten hours for one person.
It's time for everyone else to work hard!
Let's do this!
These guys are running just so they can sell stuff, huh?
an8Yeah, yeah! What's the meaning of this, you twat?
an8You've got some nerve, picking a fight with the Air Sumo Club!
Wh-What?
Are you telling us to eat mist or something?
Hello.
How many more?
Like I said, you're strict.
The club reform isn't solely for budget reduction.
You were slacking off just now.
Sorry.
Really.
i1You piss me off so much.
i1What should we do with this?
Yuuki will pull an all-nighter to work on it.
Wh-What are you talking about?
You're just so hopleless.
an8but isn't your attendance at risk of being too low?
an8This is also my chance to repay Chisato for the favor she did me.
an8A favor?
Another old joke?
Excuse me.
Your name is Ooshima Yuuki, correct?
No need to repeat yourself.
You misunderstood me!
That makes eight.
Well, I swung by to see you produce some sticky, white stuff.
Oh, Yuuki-senpai...
It's the portion of alcohol that naturally evaporates in the aging barrel, isn't it?
That's exactly right!
Should I make some tea, Yuu-kun?
You got it!
Could you be any meaner?
I'm lonely!JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST SHE WANTS THE DICK
I don't want you to get distracted.
Excuse me!
A-Anyway, let's do our best!
an8But man, we're lucky to have landed a spot right next to the event stage.
Give me ten of them!
Just what you'd expect from the Finance Commission.
Why are you helping the enemy?
So obvious...
No less from the General Affairs Commission.
We don't have enough space in our club stall!
People will be pouring in soon!
Please line up here!
Okay, the newest one and England x America!
Oojima...
Then we'll take...
It's 500 yen with the photo ticket?
Wh-What's with the getup?!
Say, "Open up!"
I'm counting on you guys!
Here you go.
I'm Tatsumi Moheiji, the candidate endorsed by the General Affairs Commission.
I take it that it's in opposition to the Finance Commission manifesto?
Should that happen, I'll be there to guide you.
Like what?
Those interested should come to the EAC office located below the stage.
Yuuki, you're up.
Th-This is the script for the speech!
I need to get this to Yuu-kun!
Oojima Yuuki will begin his speech shortly.
Exactly!
Oh, right. I don't have time to be listening to other speeches.
Huh?
Are you feeling okay, Mifuyu?
Not only does she have wonderful and genuine policies that consider
I need to focus on my own speech!
a love letter from Mii-chan!
My name is Oojima Yuuki!
Otherwise, your vote won't count!
A whole bunch of clubs are facing budget cuts,
Huh? Aren't you...
an7With the voter turnout at 98.4 percent,
Oh, we already have candidates projected to qualify!
Yes. I am at Mr. Oojima's campaign office.
an8Yay!
...so he won't make it at this rate!
But...
That many?!
Yuu-chan has 138 votes, which is 9.2 percent of the total votes!
If that happens,
Another update!
The minimum pass line is 604 votes, so you only need 33 more votes!
Yuuki's the only independent!
Campaigning from now on will take a lot of resources. You'll need all the funds you can get!
That's right! Don't let what's to come scare you!
Hooray!
What's so scary about that?
Next time, Episode 7: Camp!
Good job today!
I'm sure Daiki-kun is happy for us.
q0an8All of you performed excellently during the primaries.
And these are the votes received by the other two candidates, Shinonome and Tatsumi.
q0and the General Affairs Commission has 1,400, for a total of 3,000.
One hint lies in Shirakawa Ayame, the candidate who nearly qualified yesterday.
I need to really get it out there that I'm not a part of any of the three commissions!
How would doing that sway people to vote for you?
However, she's also the Finance Commission candidate, a member of the Student Council.
Between a revolution led by a member of the old order
Man, that guy's a pro!
He really feels like a capable man.
He must be popular!
q0Girls love guys who can cook. It's a worthwhile trait.
Making food together with the one you love sounds like so much fun!
Wh-What are you doing?
Stopping the bleeding.
q0A perfect dish that hits the spot! Japanese-style curry done right!
We can handle this from here, so don't worry.
Whoa!
W-Wait a second!
Oh, you look ready to go!
Dummy.
You already kissed me, after all!
Come on, Hazuki-sensei!
What is it now? You can't sleep on a different pillow?
It's no use.
Hey, Yume, wake up!
I'll never let you go.
Come on. Let's get back to the campsite.
I'm inside...
No, not that we know of.
Where did he go?
Um, thanks.
You were guilty the moment you stepped into the girls' campsite, with its strict no-men policy.
Then let me ask you another question.
Yes. I understand why you care about her more than a normal student would.
And you're not against it at all.
Anyway, Western sweets, Western sweets...
You called?
Don't you want to?
Ouch!
It's troubled my mother ever since.
Now's your chance.
Hey, Yuu-kun, you want some?
Staying up late is bad for your skin!
I'm a heavy sleeper, so I didn't notice anything, either.
Test of courage?
Now, let's go give school ghost stories a try!
Wh-What are you talking about?
Huh? Oh, with Hazuki-sensei. Right.
Who else were you with?
I was with Hazuki-sensei.
But she got so drunk that she passed out, so I took her to her camp dorm.
I mean, yesterday...
I'll be with you whenever you need me.
Looks like we caught up to you.
I knew booze was the only thing I could trust.
I can't believe my little sister would make a cuckold of me.
I was holding back since I'm an adult and should know better.
Plus, I thought you had Chisato.
But if you're going to date Satsuki, that's a different story.
I'm surprised you agreed to this so easily.
You must still be drunk.
Oh, did that manage to rile you up?
Good for you, Satsuki.
I'll take him.
She's thinking hard about her next move.
A story?
Can you guess who it was?
That's right.
It'd be as though my late mother never existed in the first place.
If I accepted the truth about our family...
I've made up my mind.
No one's blaming you, Satsuki.
He secretly met with Shinonome late at night?
Oojima is quite the troublemaker.
If Shinonome were to use this against him...
Prepare to hand the tasks over to him and keep an eye on the Katahira Faction.
You usually get cravings for sweets when you're thinking hard.
The brain runs on glucose, so they say that you may even perform better when you eat sweets.
I'll give you my half, too, so wake up.
Oh, shoot!
Come on, hurry up.
We, the Public Safety Commission,
our prospects for next year's election will be dim.
if the independent candidate Oojima Yuuki, who has no ulterior motives, is elected President...
an8Nope.
She must've started talking about the past to distract me!
Why are you so angry?
Attention, everyone!
Will you go out with me?
With the rule of Public Safety Commission ending, this year is our chance to rise to power!
an8Please vote for Oojima Yuuki!
an8Please give it back!
Please!
You guys...
I can handle stuff like this.
I was actually more frightened by the Public Safety Commission members.
and they left her traumatized.
Eventually, it grew too much for her, and she stopped coming to school altogether.
but the Public Safety Commission has never really cracked down on financial aid student harassment.
You were really cool.
They can't join clubs, either.
q0Financial aid students aren't doing anything to deserve harassment!
I feel like I'm an executive who was just discharged from prison or something.
Oh.
I'll do my best to live up to your expectations!
while the Food Club is getting shut down?
Right?
We have to win the election!
I'm right here with you.
We're only cooperating with him to help him get elected.
Let me see!
I'm sure they found Yuu-kun charming.
Huh?
Yaoemon.
Huh?
Eat it.
I'll always stay by your side...
I want to take a bath.
It was my fault.
It must've been a big shock for you,
Please.
You promised me.
I'm right here!
Liar...
Don't leave me alone. Stay by my side.
What?
That's exactly it!
break
Not here.
I fixed it to make up for that.
The name carved on the back.
I came to Takafuji to find Kana...
Are we clear, Oojima-kun?
That's so...
q3Do you understand how to go about making your ideal a reality?
an8Ooshima-san, please come to the accounting desk.
Huh?
Yeah.
What are you people doing?
All right.
Oogibashi Kana was one of the agents assigned to me.
Would you like me to continue?
The amount of money that moves through this school can reach tens of billions each year.
had been removed.
The hospital is renowned for its treatment concerning cases like hers,
Could you help me out a little?
Chisato...
I don't care about the election.
Am I wrong?
she was always in the back of your mind.
It's actually pretty funny.
No!
Stop.
Stop!
Please, don't say any more.
If you were elected President...
If you could, Kana would...
You far exceeded my expectations.
I wanted to be forgiven.
But I can't let myself be happy, no matter what!
When I was held back a year and felt out of place in my own class,
So it hurts me when you're suffering, too.
i1This...i0
I know you love Daiki-kun very much.
Did you tell Morishita-san about Kana-san?
This is truly unfortunate.
Morishita-san!
I looked everywhere for you.
I practiced that song you taught me.
I believe he earned them on his own merit.
Right away.
What?! You can't make it?!
Don't do this to me, man.
I know this is sudden, but could you two do me a favor?
Please! I'm begging you!
We did this before when we were kids.
I'd love to eat it again.
Different people like different kinds of sweets.
an8Katahira Faction?
What'd you say?!
Why don't we talk with Yuu-kun?
If you don't make up, things will only get worse.
You've been using him as a replacement for your brother?
You're in love with Yuuki, too, right?
It's fine. Yuuki won't mind something like that.
When a new party comes to power, they will audit our spending.
it will be exposed that Public Safety funds were used to pay for her treatment.
If you were elected President...
You reached out to me.
I can't let you bear this pain alone.
i1This...i0
I'm sure Daiki-kun is happy.
Mifuyu!
I'm sorry I put you through all this.
And finally, I have one last thing to say.
Not about the election, and not about Morishita-san!
Depending on what happens next,
Excuse me!
At this hour?
Excuse me, but I need you to come
Find Morishita Michiru immediately.
It's me. This is urgent.
Right away.
What?! You can't make it?!
According to a recent poll, 50 of people surveyed like Western sweets,
I have thirty minutes.
Hello?
What are you planning to
an8What about the operation?
an8taking pictures of a backroom deal.
You have a point.
I'll go speak to the club president.
Can you hear me, Yuu-kun?
Dammit!
This is Chisato's...
q3In any case, it's just wonderful that Kana-chan finally woke up.
That's unfortunate.
but it seems like that was taken.
Sorry, but I have important business to attend to.
He'll be speaking last!
You're... Shiohama-san?
He doesn't look "okay" at all.
This is bad! Yuu-kun was seen near Asaoka Academy!
This is an emergency.
Please wait patiently just a little longer.
q3I'll tell you where the girl is once we confirm you're there.
Are we clear?
It's all your fault, Yakumo-senpai.
It truly is my fault for appointing you.
You're more important to me.
What are you doing?!
You're shouldering everyone's hope.
But it's too late.
Don't concern yourself with that.
But he doesn't have that much time lef
This completes the speeches for all candidates.
before you return to your classrooms.
You don't have to listen,
Please give me just a little bit of time!
q3I'd regret seeing a potential topic for debate left out due to a time constraint.
Don't you feel the same way, Mr. Tatsumi?
But...
All right, tell them everything that happened!
I was only able to successfully garner support thanks to his expertise.
Raising campaign funds, creating a positive image for myself,
Not once did I hear the word "justice."
But I really don't think I can do my job well
I can tell from how you're all listening to me talk to myself without leaving!
q3Having a drink while watching the leaves change colors is one of life's great luxuries.
an8Seriously?!
an8Oh, really?
q0an8It was a very unusual approach to an election campaign.
You're right.
Understood?
Hey, hold on!
q3Also, don't speak to anyone about what happened today.
Hey, wait! Hello?
an8Oh, I almost forgot.
q0The Student Council President, of all people, can't be late for that!
Huh? Okay.
Sorry, Mii-chan.
Dammit!
q3In any case, it's just wonderful that Kana-chan finally woke up.
Is it true that Public Safety was wheeling and dealing with General Affairs?ioryogi pls to shorten this as much as you can
Oh, no. Look how late it is.
That bought us some time!
I'm good at drawing lots.
I'm so sorry.
They inflated the number of club members?
Did you get into a fight or something?
Your smartphone, Kana?
Oosawa Yuina, pattern black. Be careful.
q0Next we have a speech from Oojima Yuuki, an independent candidate.
However, he has yet to arrive.
I'm sure you get it by now.
Now this is the last one.
That voice...
Please hurry.
I jacked your line.
This is Oogibashi Kana's smartphone.
So you were dealing with them all along.
Chisato!
But he doesn't have that much time lef
Sorry for being late!
All right!
Thank you for your patience.
I... I must first apologize to all of you.
I...
That's not what we meant!
and that I can do the right thing after I got elected.
q3It was all for the sake of a club where we just eat snacks and chat every day.
but I experienced many things in the process,
an8Oh, really?
A special day?
Okay.
as long as you have those sideburns.
Still, the customer might not be satisfied unless Alicia came along.
Okay then, let's go practice!
Ah, umm...
But... I'm only a journeyman, so I can't take on customers...
WhatEh?!
I'm not a customer, so...
Ah...
I bet you're from Manhome, right?
You can't get that feeling on Manhome, right?
Why did you get on my gondola?
Aika-chan!
I'm taking this girl along as a friend, not a customer. Her name's Ai-chan.
She just came from Manhome
C'mon, hurry up and get off.
Which one of us? That'd be me.
No I'm not.
Himeya Company's motto is Punctual with pleasant talk, so, uh...
You're delivery's way too stiff.
Ah.
You like this city?
No sappy lines allowed!
Wanna eat one?
So, how's it fair to give her a free ride when she has money?
No one's faster than she is at rowing backwards!
She's fast!
Isn't it so true?
I love my sister, but I got kinda tired of hearing her brag about it all the time.
So after a while, I started to hate Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
I can't say I really blame you.
So I figured I should ride in Alicia-san's gondola, since my sister bragged about that the most...
When I get home, I'll have something to brag about to my sister!
I don't think your sister was bragging...
Yeah.
Okay.
I remember that couple!
It takes a little work to learn to love something that you hate.
Maybe Ai-chan made that miracle happen because she wanted to love her sister even more.
There's nothing here... And there's nobody here either.
But the name Neverland sort of intrigued me.
I suppose we can't reach the second beach to the right by following the coast, can we?
Then more training after that!
And then much more where that came from!
Akari-chan, you don't have to be so tense.
That was to exercise your hips and legs!
You're not making any headway at all!
Behold, the willpower of a single of a Single!
Ahh... Darn it.
May I borrow your oar?
Amazing!
I wish we were that good.
This is delicious, Alicia-san!
So, while I'm against it, you can take the rest of the day off.
No sappy lines allowed!
Has anyone seen Alice?
Let's go, Akari!
Aika-chan, don't you think
Grilled rice balls are cancelled!
Thank you so much for inviting us here today!
I want to hear that magnificent singing voice of hers!
Next time, That Which You Want to Protect...
Since Aika-chan's on a company vacation, today it's just Alice-chan and myself training.
then I'll never be able to write with it, either.
This is Maa-kun.
I found her abandoned three days ago.
Forget it. With that pudgy-wudgy tummy of his, President Aria would really be in trouble.
Athena-senpai, didn't I ask you to knock before coming in?
Huh? Say, Alice-chan...
Doesn't Athena-senpai look like the girl with the beautiful singing voice we saw before?
Huh?
Athena-senpai, you poured all the gomme syrup into your drink again, didn't you?
Of course, my left hand always loses.
Okay!
...yes, it was the biggest reason for the migration.
...and they accomplished so much in that time.
Yes. And yet, it took many failures before they succeeded...
Maa-kun!
That couldn't be. There's no use in assuming the worst.
Huh?
What?
I couldn't even protect Maa-kun.
Thank goodness you found her.
So, that's why you wanted to discuss it with me.
If Aika-senpai was around, I'd discuss it with her.
Oh...
Mr. President!
Ah, that startled me!
Oh, and this is Aria, our President.
Oh, so this is the Athena-senpai I've heard so much about!
Akari-senpai, do you want to stay over?
Alice-chan, won't Athena-senpai find Maa-kun?
I think we should be okay for now.
Athena-senpai is as clumsy as she looks.
Alice-chan! You shouldn't talk like that about a senior when she can hear you!
And Maa-kun reminds me so much of him.
All right, as I mentioned in the last lecture,
the large-scale Aqua migration project began.
...and they accomplished so much in that time.
Maa-kun!
Alice-chan!
We're sorry.
Athena-senpai...
Hm?
I'm going start a campaign right now, to start thanking the left hand more.
No, you are Sideburns,
Hello, thank you for your call, this is Aria Company.
What?
Why should I?!
Um, Aika-chan? It's okay, isn't it? To be her friend?
HuhEh?!
These are a lot different from the ones you eat on Manhome.
I thought you didn't have any money.
The potato's so big.
All right then, I'm taking us out!
No one's faster than she is at rowing backwards!
I apologize for the sudden deviation from our planned route.
You said you wanted to ride in Alicia-san's gondola.
But I'm glad you let me ride with you today!
The buttered baked potato was so good, and that backward rowing was a lot of fun!
When I get home, I'll have something to brag about to my sister!
Is there any way we can make this up to you?
No, I didn't mind at all! It was a lot of fun for me too!
I was hoping to invite Alicia-san to join us on her lunch break tomorrow.
I'm not Sideburns.
If you're inquiring about hha gondola booking, I can
Don't worry about me.
This is Aqua. This city is Neo-Venezia!
Then you can take me.
Okay then, let's go practice!
HuhEh?
Stuff like that.
Um, so this is something I thought up to practice how to row without rocking the gondola.
Do you like gondolas?
Yeah, I suppose it is inconvenient compared to Manhome.
You can't get that feeling on Manhome, right?
Ai.
Aika-chan!
Let's see, it's been 150 years since Aqua was terraformed so people could live here.
That was the only reason.
All its inconveniences, how slowly things happen, everything.
This city is made of miracles, isn't it?
HuhEh?!
I've eaten them at home before, but I didn't really like it.
Huh?
President Aria?
We have to hurry!
Thank you so much, Alicia-san.
Is there any way we can make this up to you?
It's okay, really.
it takes work to make that happen, huh?
It all started this morning...
Uh-huh? You're not surprised?
Apparently, after the acqua alta, summer comes to Neo-Venezia in earnest!
I think I'll probably be back by nightfall.
OhAh, that's right! We're out of food for President Aria.
Take care.
Well, today is the acqua alta,
Splash. Splash.
Phew, I really wasn't expecting this.
Then that kitty is President Hime, just as I thought!
Well then, please do.
Just what you'd expect from Himeya's only daughter.
And anyway, we all talk sort of formally, so it's not like they're showing me special respect.
And I have to pay.
Aika-chan, please apologize!
After making something that looks so delicious, you might really be hired into Aria Company!whether the "s" sound is the pan sizzling or not, a start keyframe snap seems to work well here
Sorry for the wait.
but she lives someplace else! What a let down.
You know,
If only I wasn't the heir to Himeya,
then I would have definitely joined Aria Company!
HuhEh?!
Sorry, President Aria!
If you have something to say to me, I'll listen.
There's Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia
Quiet! Knock it off!
And even after we both swore to become Primas together,
No my, my, my's allowed!
No hee-hee-hee's allowed either!
My, my. Hee-hee!
That's right.
But if she wins, she gets to do whatever she wants.
That's right, the walnut bread here is Akira-san's favourite.
If that happens, I think I'll have a talk with the company.
I actually won the race.
It seems like, if the everyday scenery changes,
You don't know? Actually, I don't know either.
That's right. That's an important attitude to have if you want to be a professional Undine.
Having a flood all over the city sounds like a lot of trouble,
When the water reflects the blue skies of Aqua,
Well, today is the acqua alta,
Splash. Splash.
splishity-splash!
Huh?
HuhEh? Why not?
OhEh?
Sorta.
Oh, Akira-san!
Honestly! There's a limit to how soft that Alicia can be.
You think her coddling would help an amateur like you become a professional Undine?
Aika-chan, please apologize!
Aika-chan's Special Fried Rice complete!BD: "Special Aika-chan fried rice complete." It could work but sounds like she cooked some of herself in it.
Don't go to bed without brushing your teeth!Not much onscreen time but legible
And, Don't make your room messy!
On one side Akira-chan can be a bit strict, but the truth is she's actually really kind.A keyframe snap works with visuals but to be safe.
Back then, Alicia-san was still a Single.
the moment I decided I was going to be an Undine.
then I would have definitely joined Aria Company!
Please.
Oops a daisy!
It's all right.
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
I guess it's really true what they say about the student being like the master.
OyHey!
I really hate that part of you!
OyHey!!
Next time, With That Transparent Young Girl...
Even as a pro, entertaining tourists is a lot of work, isn't it?h
No matter what you're doing, you take too long to do it!
Understand? When your passengers board, have them get on one at a time, slowly.
Plant one leg on the deck as a brace, and hang on to the posts firmly.
Today's performance is Carmen.
Brilliant, as expected.
Totally thorough.
So I thought, He's a really nice guy, isn't he?
There's a statue of the Virgin Mary down this way.
Neo-Venezia is filled with many inconspicuous yet wonderful things which soothe the spirit.
Perhaps it's like your husband, in a way.
Which will be nothing but boring!
You mean?
That's fine with you, isn't it?
All right! All right!
Yes!
Akari?
It's currently used as a small museum, displaying the treasure he once owned.
Wow, that's impressive, Aika-chan! You're good at explaining things.
You keep going to fast.
What did you come out here for, Alicia?
I'm so happy to be able to have tea with you, Alicia-san!
Hey! We meet again, Akari-chan!
Yes!
Or so I said, but we're stuck now.
Okay, then that way!
Don't tell them that! Why don't you show them what to do?
Have we failed?
Going that way.
It seems to flowing to the other side of that door.
We've got a lot of obstacles in here.
Crybaby!
What's the big deal?
What are you waiting for?
HuhEh?
His pudgy-wudgy tummy?
That girl's incredibly good!
It's nice to meet to you.BD: "How do you do?" In English you'd ask their name first before saying either of these things so either will do. Who says "how do you do" these days?
How old are you?
But since it's for Alicia-san, there's no helping it.
Well, yeah.
Alice-chan, do you want to eat breakfast with us?Add "Oh!", "Ah!" or "Hey," and change timing to suit but this looks better.
I hate to say it, but in a few years, they'll be the top water guides in the city.
Yes, if you'll excuse me.
Now what?
They asked me for an autograph and I said no, that's all.
They idolize you.
Okay!
Smile?
Sorry!
You're over-steering!
Do you have the day off from your job as a Salamander?
Man, I'm waiting for someone, but there's no sign of him showing up.
why don't you guide me around this area to kill some time.
Um, Akatsuki-san?
We're friends, right?
I keep telling you, they're not sideburns.
What's wrong?
Um, yeah so, um...
Um...
Right, right.
Lying to herself and hiding her real feelings behind a phony smile.
HuhEh?
Yeah, this world is protected thanks to guys like me.
It must be hard balancing all this with school-work.
Akatsuki-san!
Sure!
When you give someone a ride in your gondola,
We still have a bit of time before the last ride down."some time" reads like "sometime"
I'll join you.
Mine too.
Nope, not at all!
So, let's be friends, Alice-chan!
Well, this could be fun!
I'm Alice from Orange Planet.
Hey, hey, stop, stop!
I can see for myself.
Well, yeah.
You're still growing, so you must be hungry after training, right?
I guess it's to be expected a rising talent like that is totally full of herself.
Good morning.
What a lovely gift!
Ah, Alicia-san's on the front cover this month!
I feel sorry for them.
Yes.
Which one should I get?
There's no need to be scared, Mr. President.
Trouble?!
All right!
Great, so now I'm practice she says, huh...
Wow!
About 150 years ago.
She's got those long sideburns, after all.
Ah! Akatsuki-san, please don't stand up!
The best way to kill time at times like this is to people-watch!
Were you keeping him company?
Well, see you later.
There are large and small islands all over the Neo-Adriatic Sea.
for sure, it will come to you naturally.
It feels good, doesn't it?
Good work, Sideburns.
What should we do, Alice-chan? Wanna go?
Why are you so happy?
There, see? That's the power of a Single!
Yeah. The weather will be nice tomorrow too.
I baked some cookies. Wanna get some tea to go with it?
Delivering people's precious thoughts to one another.
Where are you going, President Aria?
A letter?
Hm, not there.
Oh, there's a data card inside.
Is it really that old?
You're the only one I can rely on.
The postman's looking up the address for me right now.
You promise you'll deliver it?
Beyond time and space?
Ami!
A gift for you.
Right.
Did you take a handkerchief?
Got your delivery map ready?
Yeah!
And here we are now, swimming in it like fish.
I'm gonna speed up a little.
q2But when you Undines guide people in your gondolas, your job is to create those precious feelings.
Somebody worked hard, because they believed they could make a dream come true!
Are these... gravestones?
I borrowed it from the florist.
Hey, Akari-chan! Come here! I've found it!
Oh. Coming!
The sea level's risen quite a bit!
Even though there are a lot of tough times right now,
Nothing can stop that cat.
They were carried to him.
Ai-chan, after we got back to Neo-Venezia, I tried to find that canal again,
Something like The Grand Sappy Lines Tour?
Next time, To That Island That Shouldn't Exist...
I baked some cookies. Wanna get some tea to go with it?
Bye!
Sure.
Well then, shall we go now, President Aria?
Please.
You're the only one who noticed me.
A gift for you.
My, my, my!
Yeah. No luck unfortunately.
What does that mean?
Where is it?
Yeah, I suppose so. That particular place was...
Your gourmet cat food has arrived, Mr. President.
Are you really going?
Got your delivery map ready?
I'd rather you compare it to dolphins or mermaids or something.
This is the first time I've ever swum out this far as well.
According to the map, it should be somewhere around here.
I found you, Akari-chan!
Akari-chan, that letter might be from long ago.
This base dug up more water than expected,
Accidents like that happened all the time.
It's the same name.
HuhEh?
They were carried to him.
Aika-chan, Alice-chan, let's go on an adventure!
I can't believe I just received this! It's an invitation to Neverland!
There's nothing here, and there's nobody here either.
Hm? That way?
Hello? Excuse me!
You got an invitation too, Alice-chan?
Nope. That's impossible.
They lured us out here in the hopes of showing us our dreams, and then crushing them.
All the Undines have finally arrived!
Yikes! And Akira-san?!
We can work you as hard as we want!
Anyway, it looks like that Athena ended up going to the wrong island.
I understand. Also, my name is Alice.
All right! One more set!
That is... really a mystery.
Again!
My, my.
I hate to say it, but...
Alicia-san's homemade boxed lunches?!
Mm! These sandwiches are great, Alicia!
My, my, thank you.
you will... do whatever you please!
I hope it really feels like the ocean of Neverland to you, Akari-chan.
I'll enjoy the ocean as much as I can!
Has anyone seen Alice?
What! She found such a cool place like that?!
My skin's rough and my body's aching.
I lost one of my favourite ribbons.
And then what happened?
I'd forgotten all about that, and now suddenly I remember it.
Isn't it ready yet?
This one's good too. So's this, and this too!
This is great!
Who are you saying cooks like a man?!
No said anything like that...
You're really sexy dynamite!
What?
When you're a child, you're sure they're real.
My, my!
I saw your gondola on the beach, so I figured I'd head this way.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I wonder who's behind all this.
Isn't it obvious? Your special training.
Your special training started as soon as you made your way to this island!
Hey! Put your backs into it!
Akari, no slouching allowed!
I'm fallin!
My, my.
Maybe it's about time we show them what the pros can do?
Can't move...
Ah, yes. You can't swim in the ocean back on Manhome anymore.
I hope it really feels like the ocean of Neverland to you, Akari-chan.
I'll enjoy the ocean as much as I can!
Does it feel nice?
The waves sound so peaceful, don't they?
I'm kind of tired...
It's such a strange feeling...
I'd forgotten all about that, and now suddenly I remember it.
This is how a real man's cooking should taste
Can't sleep?
We forget so much in our lives. It's sorta sad.
Maybe the entire world of Aqua itself is Neverland.
That's because you're a wonderful person, Akari-chan.
What is it?
When I do, I'll be sure to invite you to visit, Akari-san?
Next time, That Which You Want to Protect...
If you really stare, most people's response would be:
I doubt they were ugly, because it had your feelings baked inside.
Since Aika-chan's on a company vacation, today it's just Alice-chan and myself training.
Wasn't that the prettiest voice you ever heard?
Alice-chan, could it be that you're in a bad mood?
You know, if anything happens, be sure to tell your big sister about it.
Huh? What do you mean by that?
If I can't get it to hold chopsticks as well as my right hand does,
It's really problematic!
I named her Maa-kun because she meows maa! all the time.
Maa-kun, don't cry.
This is my roommate, Athena-senpai.
Oh. May I?
Wow, it's like a stylish restaurant.
Athena-senpai is as clumsy as she looks.
President Aria and I will be sleeping over in your room tonight.
I wonder if she's lonely in that dark place.
yes, it was only 150 years ago.
It's nice to meet you. I'll be sharing this room with you from now on.
Maa-kun is... Maa-kun is...
Where could Maa-kun have gone?
That couldn't be. There's no use in assuming the worst.
Hm?
Next time, Doing That Wonderful Job...
Let's spend a wonderful moment together!
But once they realise it, they can see a glimpse of warmth in the face of the one who helped them.
I wanted to make something yummy for my mom and dad to eat.
I doubt they were ugly, because it had your feelings baked inside.
I think it's more important for an Undine to be good at rowing the gondola.
And, um, that's a problem somehow?
I'm keeping a cat.
Athena-senpai, didn't I ask you to knock before coming in?
Huh? Say, Alice-chan.
I think we should be okay for now.
OhAh, there it is.
When she's useless like that...
Oh?
Punishment.
Akari-senpai, you have the day off from work today, don't you?
See you later!
The left hand does do a lot, staying in the shadows to do its part.
Alice-chan!
Huh?
And then it ran away.
Wait, were you singing just now to try and find Maa-kun?
But still, thanks to that, I stopped feeling so bad and felt warm inside.
Next time, Doing That Wonderful Job...
Akari-san, listen to this.
I was scolded by my mom yesterday.
but I was slow getting ready and got there late.
So then, my mom said, No matter what you're doing, you take too long to do it.
You're late!
I heard that!
Are you okay?
Who are these girls?
Yes.
Sorry for the disruption.
Oh, I see.
So I thought, He's a really nice guy, isn't he?
All right! Let's begin your individual on-site training!
She doesn't seem like the Akira-san I saw from before.
Akari?
OyEnough!
Aika! I've told you time and again.
We're going to hit!
Gondola, coming through.
Akari, go back! Back!
When will the tide start to recede?
Around dawn, I think.
Akari-senpai. Aika-senpai.
What, you want me to scold you?
Akari-san, listen to this.
I'm really very excited.
And this is President Maa of Orange Planet.
Perhaps it's like your husband, in a way.
In the role of customers.
Thanks!
Okay, next!
OyEnough!
Next.
Gondola, coming through.
How wonderful! All of you, give it your best!
Whwhwhwhat'll we do?
Dunno.
Please be quiet and wait until it's over.
He's only here because I said I wanted to participate.
It's not your fault.
Ah, the ask the locals who know the area strategy?
And, pull!
I'm worrying enough for all of us.
Like you always do.
Excuse me a moment.
What's the big deal?
It's really big!
I thought you'd be yelling at us.
I had plans to go out with my friend's family,
It's the real Akira-san! You're even prettier than your photos!
Um...
Incidentally, that is President Hime of Himeya Company.
H-Hey!
Yes, and we decided we just had to come to Aqua for it!
Today's performance is Carmen.
Yeah, yeah.
We'll make a slight detour here.
Gondola, coming through!
Really?!
All right! All right!
Right.
We're going to hit!
Louder!
Gondola, coming through!!
I suppose that's fine.
My, my!
AhWoody-san!
As the tide comes in, the water level rises,
It's a hard problem to grasp, even for Primas.
How wonderful! All of you, give it your best!
How could we get blocked off so quickly?
Listen, you three.
Don't tell them that! Why don't you show them what to do?
No helping.
Here we go.
Whoops.
Stop, Akari!
A dead end?
Aren't you mad?
That's an irreplaceable gift from those who are irreplaceable in our lives.
Next time is a double feature!
Yeah!
What a beautiful sunset, isn't it, President Hime?
My, my, my.
Yeah. Since we Gnomes work underground,
President Maa!
Thank you so much!
There's a circus class nearby that I'm participating in,
Are you okay? President Aria?
Keep at it.
Well then, why don't you give it another go?Alt: Okay, now let's see you try it again.
Oh!
Look at this, Akari-chan.
This really feels great!
He must have been so scared.
for dinner we have my special omurice!
She can't hear me?
I almost never see you up here on the surface.
There's a great place near here!
Keep at it.
I dunno! I'm going to look for him!
Thank you!
I want to meet her, I want to meet her!
Hm, I think I'd like to know.
Ai-chan, between the busy summer and autumn sightseeing seasons,Alt: tourist seasons
My, my, my.
It looks like President Aria has gone to do some errands.
Ribbit?
Yeah!
My, my, my!
President Aria is reading it again. That Nyan Nyan Puu picture book.
What should I do? I have to stay with these packages.
President Maa!
Oh, you brought them all back?
If I have to grow old, then I want to be a wonderful old person!
Do you feel sick or something?
She's a super extra firsttop-top-top-class Undine!
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
Thank you very much.
an8Jougasaki Village. Jougasaki Village.
I thought Alicia-san said Grandmother would meet us at the station...
Akari-chan, Aika-chan, and Alice-chan, right?
Pleased to meet you, venerable Grandmother.
Huh? Chestnut gathering?
Not really.
All right! I'm gonna get more too!
Oh, that reminds meAh, that's right!
That's really danger
Really tasty!exquisite
Wha?! No, this is mine!
H-Hot, hot, hot...
Feels good, huh?
There's so much I want to ask.
They're all such nice girls aren't they?
Wow!
She's one of the best Undines alive today.
The act of living day to day can truly be the most wondrous thing.
Aw...
Grandma really is an amazing person, isn't she?
Me too.
I'm aiming for number one in Aqua.
Grandma really is a wonderful person, isn't she?
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
If that's your dream, does that mean it's okay if people don't admire you now?
Do you feel sick or something?
she was the one who reigned at the top of Aqua's water guide industry for more than 30 years.
Wow...
She's known as Grandmother, and is honoured as the legendary Great Water Fairy!
Here you go, Aika-chan.
Our skills are going to fall apart at this rate!
There's no need to be so formal. Please, just call me Grandma.
So this person is the legendary Great Water Fairy.
I pity what's going to happen to themnext.
This is important training too, right?
You'll find sweet potatoes of all shapes and sizes.
Are you ready yet?
Let's see...
Eat as much as you like!
I'm glad you liked it.
Feels good, huh?
Wow! Tatami mats!
Yay!
They really are warm.
everything she does is truly top class.
but the reason she's where she is now, is entirely different.Alt: reason she's where she's at now
Fun?
But if that's it, what do you do in hard or sad times?
Make everything something to enjoy.Oh if only it was that simple...
Grandma really is an amazing person, isn't she?
Yeah.
I'm aiming for number one in Aqua.
because it sparkles so brightly.
Even people we don't know?
Of course.
So c-cold...
What's gotten into you?!
Snowbug?
My, my! You've certainly been shopping!
Well, we're busy with winter coming, so we have to squeeze in shopping when we can.
Oh, so now do you appreciate all that I do for you?
Okay! It'll be fun!
I'll go with you.
All right! Let's do extra good at practice, and then go to the hot spring with Alicia-san!
OhAh!
OhEh? You think I can do it?
Right.
There's even more back here.
Oh! A connoisseur!
Ah, paradise, paradise.
Who cares? I'm happy, so leave me alone.
Hello there.
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep again.
Yeah...
Yeah.
This is almost like a dream.
Not bad!
Gotcha!
I'm serious!
In Neo-Venezia, they say the departure of the snowbugs heralds the first snowfall.
When that happens... Hm...
We can invite Alicia-san too!
Of course.
Akari-san, is it nearly winter on Aqua?
Gotta get up.
Get moving again and your body will warm up fast.
Oh! Sorry.
Are you cleaning?
Akari-chan?
HmAh? What could that be?
That's a snowbug.
All right little one, come with us!Alt: "you can come with us"; "come and join us"
Oh, so now do you appreciate all that I do for you?
A hot spring...
Oh! That'll be so much fun!
You couldn't keep me away!
What do you think I should bring to a hot spring?
That's a very charming little snowbug you have there, miss.
But you know, this scene almost feels warm in a way, doesn't it?
Sorry you ended up booking everything for us, Aika-chan.
Yay! I can't wait.
Isn't it?
Put all your clothes into this basket.
HuhEh?
Yep. It's different, isn't it?
I can feel it spreading through my body!?
Ah, paradise, paradise.
You need time to relax in order to get through the long, cold winter.
I'm not much of a winter person,
Akari, say your prayers!
Wha?!
Yeah...
Excuse me.
Looks like we missed dinner, huh?
Not yet! Once we work up a sweat, it's back to the baths!
Snowbugs.
I'm glad.
What is it, Alice-chan?
You know, when I'm curious about something, I can't even swallow my food right!
In the daytime, the sun is covered by a layer of lead-colored clouds.
My, my, my!
When we learned that all three of us had nothing scheduled today,
So you invited them over, right, Alicia-san?
My arms?
Gradually, it just became normal for the three of us to do group training.
Amazing! Akira-chan, you were wonderful!
Right.
Wow! Cool!
Ah, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, just stop!
My, my, my.
Since she never really sang, I never realised.
Yep. It's just like Athena-chan said.
Shall I make some cocoa?
Stop it, Akari!
an2Good night.
See you tomorrow!
Don't you think so too, Ai-chan?
I'm heading out with President Aria.
Don't just leave us hanging like that!
Really, it's nothing.
I'm curious now.
It is really freezing.
I can't believe how cold it is today!
Athena-senpai, you act like this is your house.
When we learned that all three of us had nothing scheduled today,
we decided to get together for a change.
Here you go!
Here you go.
Back when we were all still Singles, we practiced together all the time.
Just like it is for you, Akari-chan.
I hear there's a really talented girl our age over at Orange Planet!
She goes at her own pace, doesn't she?
Ah, I'm stuffed!
Weird places? Like where?
You can schedule a tour if you wish. Shall I set that up for you?
Right.
We're way past that now.
All right!
You're the Single everyone's talking about!
Back then, now, and in the years to come,
I'm kind of hungry now, too.
But they hardly ever get together now.
Good night!
They probably talked like this when they were Singles too.
The things that change are important.
I'm heading out with President Aria.
Is it winter now?
None of my customers have wanted to go there.
And this is President Aria.
Your president is a cat?
I take it you only just came to Aqua?
Um, is Pete-san the...?
So, how do you like Aqua?
one which will light up Aqua in times to come.
Um...
Say, it looks like it's warmed up outside.
Would it be okay?
I think it's cute.
HuhEh? Isn't that common knowledge on Aqua?
We seem more and more alike all the time!
That's not true at all.
That'd be nice, but...
Then, try the bread, too. I baked it this morning.
We only had a little snow a few days ago.
HuhEh?
OhAhh, Akiko-san, you're a schoolteacher?
Um, it's nice to meet you. I'm Mizunashi Akari.
OhAh, sorry!
Don't act so bossy, gachamon!
Aqua, before water flowed through the city.
You said it two years ago, and five years ago too!
You think so? Well, I won't waste time getting my hopes up.
OhAh, if you think about it...
What?
Farewell, my avvenire.
My, my! Welcome back, Akari-chan!
Alicia-san, what sort of work does President Aria do every day?
Aw...
My, my, my, my, my!
Yeah!
I'll start preparing dinner, then.
There's a great place near here!
Sure! By all means!
There's a circus class nearby that I'm participating in,
Are you okay? President Aria?
President Aria, you're amazing.
Yay!
It's snowing again.
HuhEh?
Your president is a cat?
Yes, from Manhome.
YeahAh, that's my cat's name.
The two of us share a shining destiny,
Doesn't it feel like we're messengers of the sun?
HuhEhh?!
Those who wish to refresh their souls are hhespecially welcome! Does that sound good?
I think it's cute.
HuhEh, Wha? That water will come here to the canal today!
Will just nailing it like this be okay?
HuhEh?
Do you smell something funny?
I got your hopes up, and they turned out like this!
Really?
I give tours through the city on a gondola.
On a gondola?
Yeah.
Surely the weather can't be that different on two sides of the same bridge.
That's right! I wanted to take a video of the water coming,
I'd just die if I couldn't get video of this!
The water will be coming soon!
Yep, it will.
You think it'll be lots of water, Sensei?
Hey everyone, let me introduce you to my friend.
President?
Everyone, cut that out!
They're rare, ancient creatures from Manhome!
I believe it will.
What?
And now we have the Aqua we have today.
It's amazing.
Well, it's about time for me to go.
Take care, Akiko-san.
They say cats are animals which bind the past to the future.
That's why so many people on Aqua keep cats as pets.
Nothing. It's nothing.
Because he has to loan you money.
That makes three I've gotten!
Like this?
Being nice to? Hey!
My, my.
Devil Instructor?
My, my.
Are you Al-san?
You think so?
Yeah!
You were able to come.
Wow! She's Grandma? She's wonderful!
an2Akari!
YYeah, Im fine...
Do you think maybe Aqua is welcoming me?
Yeah, I'm sure that's it, Ai-chan!
I wore it because I was coming back to Neo-Venezia.
Ai-chan, the New Year's greeting here is Auguri, buon anno, okay?
Auguri buon anno?
Okay!
What is it, Akari-chan?
Sei!
We must have fallen asleep at some point.
Aqua-chan.
The sunlight is so warm.
That's right.
Yeah. See you later.
Ai-chan and her sister looked really happy.
Yes.
Oh, what am I going to do, Alicia-san?
What the?
UhEh...
Yay! President Aria! Long time, no see!
Huh? Alicia-san, you knew that Ai-chan was coming?
So, Sideburns, who's the shrimp?
Why is that?
Because he has to loan you money.
What?timing and disconnected line looks better this way.
Y-Yes?!
In Italy, back on Manhome,
it's customary to eat food with beans in them at the end of the year.
My, my.
I came to spend New Year's with everyone!
Uh, it's just a misunderstanding!
Are you Al-san?
Oh, boy...
Grandma!
Wait, President Aria!
Ai-chan!
Wow, it's pitch black.
Was that Aqua in the past?
Same here.
HuhEh?
What are these lights?
Huh?Ah, Wait a minute.could it be?
They'll be back any minute now.
We Undines are throwing these!
We must have fallen asleep at some point.
OhAhh, she's so cute!
Aqua-chan?
What a wonderful name.
I think so too.
Oh. I think I'd like to know.
Yeah! Ready, set...
Sorry! I'll be more careful from now on.
It's a letter, isn't it?
Ribbit!
Let's make him ours!
Yeah!
What a beautiful sunset, isn't it, President Hime?
Maybe I should take a quick look around?
Whaa?!
He must have been so scared.
Yay, let's eat!
Ai-chan, President Aria is totally hero-crazy at the moment!
My, my, my, he's really crazy about Nyan-Nyan-Puu, isn't he?
Hey! You dropped something!
Ah! That pudgy-wudgy tummy.
Pretty much, I have the day off from training today.
and all the balls and stuff ended up rolling away.
That's good, that's good!
You can't let that cat show you up!
Oh, dear... Where did you drop him?
I wonder who brought him back.
Hurry up, you two, or you'll get left behind.
Next time, That Starlike Fairy...
Ai-chan, between the busy summer and autumn sightseeing seasons,
Aw...
Sorry! I'll be more careful from now on.
OhMy? President Aria?
Ribbit, ribbit.
Ribbit?
Let's take him back to Manhome!
Maybe I should take a quick look around?
Yay, let's eat!
What should I do? I have to stay with these packages.
You'd do that?
Ah! That pudgy-wudgy tummy.
we aren't affected that much by the seasons.
Oh, dear... Where did you drop him?
Yay!
No, it's not that.
That's common knowledge in the water guide industry.
You better try hard too!
I am truly honored to make your acquaintance!
please work us as hard as you can!
In that case, once you've unpacked, could you go chestnut gathering on the hill behind my house.
YeahThat's it, I get it now!
Not really.
This isn't just a matter of gathering lots you know!
I pity what's going to happen to themnext.
Did you gather a lot of them?
YeahUh-huh!
Right, right.
We have to dig the sweet potatoes out of the ground without damaging them.
Grandma...
Should we be doing this? I thought we came here for training.
WhewAhh... I think I may have overeaten.
Amazing, amazing!
Sure!
Aika-chan, want me to wash your back?
You'll sleep here tonight.
Wow! Tatami mats!
I've always slept in beds, so a futon will be new for me.
My, my, they're still up.
What you see, hear, and touch...
Oh...
But you're wonderful too, Akari-san.
If I have to grow old, then I want to be a wonderful old person!
Now, all of Neo-Venezia is wrapped in the colours of Autumn.
I wonder what it is?
Are we... really okay... like this?
We'll never become great Primas like this!
Before Alicia-san and the others became the current Three Great Water Fairies,
she was the one who reigned at the top of Aqua's water guide industry for more than 30 years.
Wow...
And by the way, Akari-senpai,
And you're okay to be here, rightjunior-chan?
Wow, what a beautiful place!
Welcome, young Undine girls.
I understand, Grandma!
The lady who started Aria Company!
In that case, once you've unpacked, could you go chestnut gathering on the hill behind my house.
This is some really tasty training she has!
I really can't wait!
Umm...
Yay, a real sweet potato dig!
What?! When did she...?!
Are you ready yet?
Ta-daa! Let's try some roasted chestnuts, too!
C'mon! Akari you big dummy!
Wha?! No, this is mine!
HuhEh?
What's with you two? Shut up!
but this has turned out to be a vacation where we just fool around.
We're never going to be Primas, ever!
Aika-chan, my face.
Huh?
so that Alicia-san could become the number one Undine star on Aqua, right?
That girl is a master at making anything fun.
Fun?
Good questionLet's see.
Maybe it's good to think of those times as the spice that helps life seem more more enjoyable?
Even though it's such a simple thing, everyone forgets it.
WhatEh?! Really?!
Okay! The next one for sure!
The number one energetic and wonderful Undine star.
Okay.
When someone calls just to listen to Alicia-san's voice message,
as long as you have those sideburns.
My second summer is just around the corner!
Don't worry about me.
It's just like I pictured it, but even better!
...I'll test my skills and become a professional Undine!
I see. Well, I guess someone else would do.
I'm afraid I'm the only one here.
Then you can take me.
If only I was qualified...
I bet you're from Manhome, right?
I thought so! I used to live on Manhome too.
Your by yourself
It's inconvenient.
Himeya Company's motto is Punctual with pleasant talk, so, uh...
Ah.
Yeah. On a world without water or air,
I've eaten them at home before, but I didn't really like it.
Huh?
Mr. President!
Shouldn't the one who's better do the rowing?
Gotcha!
President Aria!
Incredible, just incredible!
Oh, this girl's name is Ai-chan.
You said you wanted to ride in Alicia-san's gondola.
I'm really sorry for all the trouble.
I promise, if you come back again, I'll set something up.
I remember that couple!
Maybe Ai-chan made that miracle happen because she wanted to love her sister even more.
Heh, heh.Ehehe
You're lucky you're a Pair. What with both hands covered and warm.
What's gotten into you?!
Yes?
Okay! I brought plenty of bags with me.
How about you, Alice-chan?
I don't think I need to bring Alicia-san, she's coming with
OhAh, mailman-san!
Yep. Have a drink? It's genmai tea.
OhAh! Look at the chimneys!
Cozy, isn't it?
Put all your clothes into this basket.
WhaEh? Huh?!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Oh! A connoisseur!
That's true.
I guess you're right. I'm not much of a winter person,
I'm going into the bath again.
I'm sorry.
A hot spring in the sea...
But, but! It's a waste to not swim in so much water!
Alicia-san?
I see. It's time to say goodbye, huh?
but there are lots of wonderful things to make up for it.
I'll get to see my snowbug friend again, too.
HuhEhh?!
The Aquan winter is cold, isn't it?
You aren't good in cold weather either, are you, Akari-san?
...I'm getting up...
You're lucky you're a Pair. What with both hands covered and warm.
Huh?
Yes, they seem to appear out of nowhere when winter comes.
Well, we're busy with winter coming, so we have to squeeze in shopping when we can.
So Salamanders are the guardians who keep Aqua warm, aren't they?
We'll go on our next break.
YayAhh! I'm gonna be at a hot spring with Alicia-san!
Wow! Yes, please!
Oh...
What a great room!
It's wonderful...
Put all your clothes into this basket.
WhaHuh?!
This is a hot spring?
Yeah...
No sappy lines allowed!
And Alicia-san's here with me instead of my loudmouthed mentor!
I'm sorry.
Here we go!
Yeah...
Yeah!
Akira-san.
Let's stay up all night partying!
Not yet! Once we work up a sweat, it's back to the baths!
I'm serious!
Shall we go back inside?
Ai-chan, it's true that Aqua's winter is cold,
but there are lots of wonderful things to make up for it.
Next time, Those Orange Days...
Alicia! We're in a real pinch!
You there! Why don't you watch where you're sculling that gondola?!
Hi! Please excuse my friend Alicia.
Right. Thanks.
She goes at her own pace, doesn't she?
My, my, my!
Like in your arms.
Just like her junior.
Right.
Once we cross under this bridge, we enter the Grand Canal
Alicia, you go first.
OyEnough!
You okay? Cat got your tongue, Athena?
I wanted to be better at handling my oar and talking to people,
It almost seems like those memories aren't real.
They haven't had the chance for a while, so why not?
Aika-chan...
See ya!
It is really freezing.
Alicia-san, we're back!
I can't believe how cold it is today!
Athena-san. Akira-san.
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.
No! That's not a problem at all, but...
My, my, my, it was Akira-chan who suggested it.
You did?
Being a small business has always been part of the Aria Company's philosophy,
Just like Aika-senpai, huh?
Her sculling and hosting skills must be fantastic already!
She's face down...
Right. Thanks.
You don't know, huh? Well, you don't look like the type who'd follow gossip.
You shouldn't lie down right after eating.
Just like her junior.
Um, to your left you can see
I'm a little embarrassed.
Akira-chan began training extra hard at singing after that.
Akari-senpai, Aika-senpai and I won't be able to see each other for practice anymore.
Well then, President Aria, could you help pass out plates to everyone?
No sappy lines allowed!!
They'll probably be talking till morning.
To think, the Three Great Water Fairies were like us when they started.
Akari, this far is fine.
Thanks for seeing us home!
Nighty-night!
Good night!
My, my!
We just finished shovelling off the snow, and now more will pile up again.
OhAh, that's right, I copied the picture from the book.
President Aria?
President Aria!
OhAh, this the uniform of Aria Company.
No.
Would you like to come back to my place for some tea?
I only came here 6 months ago, so I still don't have much.
Um...
Yes?
With a menu of sincerity and tranquility, right?
You'll stay for lunch, right?
HuhEh Hm? About what?
HuhEh, Wha? That water will come here to the canal today!
Oh.
I'm so sorry!
On a gondola?
I suppose you would be. But you'll be very busy from now on!
Yeah.
OhAh! Teacher!
But this year, it'll work for sure!
Pretty florist shops and all sorts of stores will open, won't they?
Your right.
Water!
It's amazing.
Through the wishes of these people here... This is how Aqua began.
We just finished shovelling off the snow, and now more will pile up again.
Why not go?
Yep, this has to be it.
Shall we check it out, President Aria?
President Aria, I'm coming right now!
Right, right.
Huh?
Here we are. Make yourself at at home.
I'm home, Pete.
UhEh,, do people say stuff like that to you?
Wow, that's amazing.
Welcome to my Sunny Caf, where the sunlight warms up your whole body.
I think it's cute.
Will you help me bring some water in?
HuhEh What? You don't know?
OhAhh, the truth is I only came to Aqua a year and a half ago.
I give tours through the city on a gondola.
I suppose you would be. But you'll be very busy from now on!
HuhEh?
so I bought this new card recorder, but I've dropped it twice already!
Card recorder?
That data card, do you normally use those?
HuhHm
OkayHi! Sorry I'm late!
No, we don't know for sure!
They might fail again.
Uh-huh!
And this is President Aria.
They're rare, ancient creatures from Manhome!
But this year, it'll work for sure!
It'll work.
Yes?
That's right.
It's fun to do things on your own, isn't it?
OhAh, if you think about it...
A world built by the hands and sweat and hopes of countless people.
People determined to create a world overflowing with happiness.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
I'll ride the wind to where you are Kaze ni notte anata no moto e
I really want to ride with her.
I came with my dad and mom.
You can't get that feeling on Mahome, right?
Ai.
Uh... No.
She just came from Manhome-
The Himeya Company's motto is "Punctual, with pleasant talk!" So, uh...
Best Tasting on the Planet I have some.
It looks hard to eat.
Um, isn't that?
Akari learned to row backwards on Manhome by mistake.
No one's faster than she is at back-paddling!
Okay, just hold her straight!
Uh, this girl's name is Ai.
So, after a while, I just started to hate Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
...but I couldn't.
Maybe hate turning into love is a miracle, too.
But once you do, the one you love becomes someone you treasure.
It takes work to make that happen, huh?
I carried it gently in the palm of my hand Te no hira no ue ni sotto noseta
Humming a secret melody Kuchizusanda himitsu no merodii
Singing, though I had no place to go Utatte yo iku ate mo nai kedo
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru This is the first time you've seen the Acqua Alta, isn't it?
On That Special Day...
I should be back by nightfall.
Okay! See you later!
Shall we go buy you some food, Mr. President?
If we do things differently on this different sort of day,
Carefully, carefully...
Splish... huh?
Splish, splash.
Huh?
This isn't working!
I wasn't expecting this.
President Hime's blue eyes are so pretty, no matter how many times I see them.
Answer in 30 characters or less!
Hey, Aika! What's the idea, lazing around the house like this?!
But, going out in a gondola on a day like this is-
Shut up!
I'm sure she'll hire you into the Aria Company after making something that looks so good.
Wow, it looks amazing!
Really?
but she lives someplace else! What a let-down.
To put it bluntly, Akira considers Alicia her rival.
Really?
I can't remember why, but I was feeling really down.
Four!
There's Alicia, Alicia, Alicia, Alicia, and... oh yeah! Alicia!
I never gave you permission to be nice and let my employee stay the night!
My, my, my! And you can eat more than me without ever getting fat!
Aika, what are you going to do?
Are you really serious about quitting Himeya? Well?
Aika, wait!
Fine, but where are we going?
Doesn't matter.
Hey!
My, my, my...
I hope one day I can see those important things, as Alicia does.

I'll ride the wind to where you are Kaze ni notte anata no moto e Oh, the flow of the tide's getting complicated.
What are you talking about? We're both great Singles at this point!
We're different from when we were lame Pairs who had to wear gloves on both hands!
This is Aika from Himeya. How do you do?
Since you're a Pair, you're still apprenticing, right? How old are you?
Look, President Aria!
Huh?
Typical. Her abilities are growing, so she's totally full of herself.
It was the top among companies with only one employee.
On your way to school now?
Yes. If you'll excuse me.
Oh, no! It's our pleasure!
They did an interview with her as well.
It's that girl from before!
Well, I've really come to like it, too.
It's worth it to be able to ride with you, Miss Alicia.
I keep telling you, they're not sideburns.
If you're hassling an Undine, I'll report you to the Tourist Association!
Is this how she shows affection?
Uh, let's see... Um...
Further into the plaza is a place that's famous for the invention of caf au lait-
Hey, Sideburns! What's that?
She's got those long sideburns, after all.
Such a... sappy line...
Yeah! This world is protected thanks to guys like me!
Alice, how are you doing on time?
I mean, slower than anyone you usually see.
Looks like you're a fine Undine on the land as well, Miss.
The people who immigrated to Aqua from Manhome...
Neither have I.
I'm sure it will!
Wait just a minute!
Whoa!
Yeah! I'm out for a stroll!
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru
Soon we'll be overflowing with smiles Egao ga sugu koboreru Well, shall we be off, President Aria?
Huh? Me?
Um...
But it's a really old type.
Is it really that old?
It's awfully narrow.
The sun's so bright here.
So, that means...
Yeah. No luck, unfortunately.
The address doesn't exist, but there is a place with the same name.
Just leave it to me!
Yeah!
Then, let's take off!
The sky is a sea of its own.
We're gonna take a break on that island coming up!
This is the first time I've ever swam out this far.
Is most of your work in Neo-Venezia?
I can't believe this ocean wasn't always here.
Where do you suppose the base is?
This base dug up more water than they expected,
It's the same name. And the year he died is the same as the cancel stamp on the letter.
Oh, don't tell me you forgot! Today's our anniversary!
I carried it gently in the palm of my hand Te no hira no ue ni sotto noseta
And the bluebird will surely grant it Kanaete yo kitto aoi tori
Next Episode Aika, Alice! Let's go! On a journey of adventure!

Next Episode To That Island Which Shouldn't Exist... Next time, "To That Island Which Shouldn't Exist..."
...the path that the wind takes Kaze no yuku michi ga All right, then! Wait for me!
Come, let's let others feel Nee, tsutaeyou
I wonder who's behind this.
You're really rude.
Are you serious?
Um... Begin what?
My, my.
Huh?
and then by walking around the island!
That was to exercise your hips and legs!
Aika! No clumsiness allowed! This... is... really... hard!
I'm falling!
Again!
You guys have no spirit! None!
Both of you, keep your balance!
I wish we were that good.
My legs... no, my whole body is stiff!
I wanna try it! I wanna try it!
Mm! These sandwiches are great, Alicia!
Alicia... Thank you so much!
But it's just the ocean down there.
Hey.
It's all wonderful, somehow...
Chow down!
This is great!
Can't sleep?
I can't remember.
You don't let go of the things that are important to you.
Alicia!
Somehow, it's been a day full of wonderful things.
What is it?
Won't bother me Ki ni shinai
Make a wish upon the little star shining above Chiisana hikari hoshi ni negai o
Subtle acts of kindness aren't always easy to spot.
Huh? Exactly.
"Akari, today I made a buttered baked potato."
"Since Aika's on a company vacation, today it's just Alice and I training."
Come, let's paddle away Saa, kogidasou Alice, is it possible that you're in a bad mood?
This excitement in our hearts Kono tokimeki Huh?
Were you lonely by yourself?
Sorry for the intrusion. I'm Akari Mizunashi from the Aria Company.
Huh? Say, Alice...
When she's useless like that...
...she's probably just like my left hand.
Alice, you shouldn't talk like that about a senior where she can hear you!
Here you go.
Thank goodness!
Sure!
Still, how long can this go on?
Maa?
Alice?
Thank goodness you found her.
"I mean, he goes and eats it without asking and then just says it's 'not bad'?"
"Mean, huh?"
"Ai, there are times when we're helped by others."
"but I was slow getting ready and got there late."
"So then, my mom said, 'No matter what you're doing, you take too long to do it."'
"Oh, well..."
No matter what you're doing, you take too long to do it!
Sorry.

Thank you for asking for me by name.
The one in Undine Magazine!
This is President Aria of the Aria Company.
Incidentally, that's also President Hime of the Himeya Company.
It means "phoenix".
If you'd like to enjoy the opera affordably, there are low-priced seats available in the gallery.
The weather's nice, so it'll dry soon.
Well then, here at the Piazza San Marco is where we part company.
Oh?
That's fine with you, isn't it?
Biggest one of the day!
Wow, great job, Aika! You're good at explaining things.
Looks like Undines have it pretty rough.
Gondola, coming through.
I'm overjoyed to be able to have tea with you, Miss Alicia!
It's caramel tea from my favorite caf.
You got that from my bag?
All right! And we have to get back to training!
This season is the most difficult time of year for us Undines.
And so, the conclusion of today's training...
He's only here because I said I wanted to participate.
Hmm... Doesn't look like it's going to work.
Ah... were you going to try and ask someone who knows their way around?
Around dawn, I think.
Anyway, for our customers' sake, right now we'll do our best...
Here we go.
Right.
As we drift quietly along Odayaka ni nagareru jikan to
It's a little sad that it's all over,
It's clear, but it snows from time to time.
Akatsuki-san, Woody-san!
I wish I could show this to Ai-chan.
Yeah, that's why I came to see it.
HuhEh?!
Yay! President Aria! Long time, no see!
Little girl?
Beans?
Alicia-san! Good evening!
Devil Instructor?
Hey, Aika!
My, my.
You think so?
HuhEhh?
Good evening, everyone.
My, my, what a darling little girl. A friend of yours, Akari-chan?
A cat?
Do you think maybe Aqua is welcoming me?
I knew it, there's a hole!
They must have been falling out, and I didn't even notice.
By the way, Ai-chan, did you hbring anything to throw away?
I wore it because I was coming back to Neo-Venezia.
Yeah.
Dieci!
Ai-chan, look behind you.
Yes.
It feels like the warmth is spreading all the way down to my heart.
I'm sure it will be.
I think so too.
My, my!
The world feels brand new, dazzling and pure white.
That's right. A brand new year, fresh and white, has just begun.
ByeGoodbye!
Ai-chan and her sister looked really happy.
I'm glad she brought her baby here with her.
To the wonderful world of Aqua itself...
President Aria?

"That Melancholy President..."
He takes great pride in leading as a good company president should. President Aria?
My, my, my...
Although he ran away from home, he has nowhere to go.
My, my. It's all right, Akari.
President Aria has found a new family.
Let's take him home! Let's take him back to Manhome!
Hey, look over there!
I hope the weather tomorrow is just as nice.
You're right.
"Akari, somehow, it's like you've managed to spread the happy atmosphere..."
Enemy vanquished!!
Yeah! There's a great place near here.
Okay, then let's go!
"Who is he, and where is he from?" she thinks. Okay, then let's go!
PIN CH!
No! Ken!
God must have brought him back to me!
"Just kidding."
Filling your heart into a rainbow Astumete yo kitto reinboo
No, it's not that.
You feel really melancholic?
She's known as "Grandmother," and is honored as the legendary Great Water Fairy!
My, my, all done with your training?
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
Hmm... Let's see...
Well, why not ask her yourself?
Since she founded the Aria Company,
Good! That's the way to do it!
Leave it to Grandma!
I had a really fun time gathering them.
Mr. Potato, Mr. Potato...
Ow!
What?! When did she?!
Are you ready yet?
You should have warned me sooner!
Wha?! No, that's mine!
It's great!
Wow!
Watch where you touch me!
Yeah, that was a great bath.
Uh! Good night...
Aika, you're so melodramatic.
They really are warm.
This is the first time I've seen such a starry sky since I came here to Aqua.
The way the stars twinkle makes it seem like they're speaking.
Just like the sky changes color every day,
A once in a lifetime treasure...
Huh?
Huh?
They say if you make a wish three times while a shooting star is falling, it'll come true.
What?! Really?!
Alice?
Oh, well.
Oh! I wanna be the number one star! I wanna be...
Me too.

That Warm Holiday...
I figured I'd get the heating ready to use.
Hm? What could that be?
It's said they live under ash tree leaves in the spring...
Go on back to your friends, okay?
Hey there, Sideburns. And... Miss Alicia!
Wow! So Aqua's natural winter is actually much colder, isn't it?
What's wrong, Akari?
It warms you right to the core of your body. Wanna try it?
You couldn't keep me away!
Alicia...
Oh, Mr. Mailman!
That's a very charming little snowbug you have there, miss.
Oh...
But you know, this scene almost feels warm in a way, doesn't it?
Okay Akari, first, hold the knitting needles like this...
Then hold the yarn like this and guide it with your index finger.
Look, Akari!
Well, why don't we get ready and go to the bath?
Here's yours, Akari.
I've never been in a big bath with strangers before, so...
but the old couple who owned it had good taste.
Yeah. It looks like the house of a fairy that you'd hear about in a folk tale.
No sappy lines allowed!
Coffee milk is just the thing for drinking after a hot bath!
All right! And after a nice bath, next comes a fun dinnertime!
You need time to relax in order to get through the long, cold winter.
Me too!
My, my.
Akira!
Let's stay up all night partying!
Those feelings that never change Kawaranu omoi o
Don't just leave us hanging like that!

Alicia, we're back!
I really can't wait.
Athena, you act like this is your house.
Um... What are you and Athena doing here, Akira?
My, my, my, it was Akira who suggested it.
Are we not supposed to?
Just like it is for Akari.
Just like Aika, huh?
They say it's only a matter of time before she's promoted to Prima!
Dammit! No matter who it is, I can't let them be the next generation's number one Undine!
I'm Athena.
If you know anything about that...
My arms?
...My arms?
The Palazzo Pisani Moretta is well-known for hosting masked balls.
Perfect! Okay, Athena, you're next. Give it a try!
Right. Okay... On your right... I mean, left...
Well, she wasn't the only one who was a little slow back then.
Who goes first? Jan-ken-pon!
Someday...
...won't be able to see each other every day for practice anymore.
I'm kind of hungry now, too.
Huh?!
I had no idea all three of them trained together.

Who are you?
Why has the water in the canals dried up?
Good work, Akari.
Have you ever been there, Alicia?
I thought it looked like such a wonderful bridge.
Here it is, President Aria!
Wait, please!
I'm Akiko Hoshino.
This is the place. Make yourself at home.
Yeah, that's my cat's name. He's a little shy.
I guess, although I smashed a lot of fingers doing it.
The sunlight warms up your whole body.
You'll stay for lunch, right?
Of course. I'm making stuffed cabbage.
Sorry.
What?
They have that as a job now?
Once the climate stabilizes a bit more, I'll be able to grow vegetables without a greenhouse.
Oh! Akiko, you're a schoolteacher?
It'll probably fail this time, too.
It'll work.
But this year, it'll work for sure!
There'll be bakeries with tasty bread, and little cafs.
People who never gave up despite countless failures.
And now we have the Aqua we have today.
Through the wishes of these people here... this is how Aqua began.
On the tips of my fingers, shining like jewels Hikaru houseki mitai yubisaki ni It's the beginning of so many wonderful things.
Like a kitten, be carefree Koneko mitai kata o sukumete I'm... glad I came to Aqua.

Um, can I ask you kind of a personal question?
Meeting the people she only knows from my e-mails...
I'm so happy for her.
It's been a long time!
Hey, Sideburns. Who's the old lady?
Yeah... Maybe.
We're back! We're back!
By the way, Ai, did you bring anything to throw away?
Ai, the New Year's greeting here is "Auguri, buon anno!" Okay?
Uno!
Sis!
Thank you Akari, but if I sit down, the baby will get upset.
See, Aqua? The sun's rising.
My, my, my!
Aika, you should say that stuff to me.
The world feels brand new, dazzling and pure white.
I'm glad she brought her baby here with her.
Alicia... Auguri, buon anno.

Saying nice to meet you to someone becomes a sort of pact between you, doesn't it?
President Aria.
Please take care of things, Akari-chan.
Like I said, they aren't sideburns.
Twenty months have flown by since the day I first arrived on Aqua.
I see. Well, I guess someone else would do.
Uh, um...
Kidnapper.
I bet you're from Manhome, right?
Because you're my friend.
Um, Aika-chan? It's okay, isn't it? To be her friend?
Mr. President!
Shouldn't the one who's better do the rowing?
Give it all you've got, Akari!
A little to the left!
My, my, you have Aika-chan with you, too?
Isn't it so true?
But every place they took me was so boring.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks to you two, it looks like I've fallen in love with this city too.
Anyway, is it true that your leaving today?
I promise, if you come back again, I'll set something up.
I want to ride in your gondola again, Akari-san.
Oh, that's right. Could you give this to Alicia-san?
Looks like they made up.
Next time, On That Special Day...
Each day on my second trip through Aqua's four seasons,
That makes three I've gotten!
Hold out your hand.
Take it as thanks for being nice to my cheeky little brother here!
Well, I have to be going. See you, ladies!
Aika, who is she?
There we go, President Aria! Boing! Boing
It's been a long time.
You were able to come.
Thank you, Aika-chan.
She's my great senior, the one who founded Aria Company.
Mr. President!
Right!
That cat is...
Even though I don't know anything about that time.
Okay.
It can be anything you've used in the past year.
Then I'll... throw this.
Okay!
This year has been so...
Yes. Wonderfully spoiled.
Yes.
HuhEh?
All right, Ai. It's about time we got back to the hotel. You need your sleep.
It's a flood! The floor's flooded!
Take care.
and if we do things differently on this different sort of day,
Splish, splash,
splishity-splash!
Everything looks so different from usual. Maybe I made a wrong turn?
Huh?
I see. Sorry to bother you.
Hey, Aika! What the idea, lazing around the house like this?!
but you also managed to get Aika in on the act.
She's always been like that.
Please stop saying bad things about Alicia-san.
You think her coddling would help an amateur like you become a professional Undine?
I'll never come back to Himeya again!
We can practice together! We'll do Hindu squats!
Excuse me!
My, my, my, my!
Akari! You've got rice on your face!End looks fine. Not a keyframe just movement anyway
Man, if Akira-san were here, she'd be all:
And, Don't make your room messy!
Yeah! And you know that very well too, Aika-chan.
And she's jealous because I love Alicia-san so much.
I'm afraid it's soaked.
Sorry, President Aria!
My, my. Tehehe!
Please.
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
She sneaks into your heart like the tide,
No sappy lines allowed!
but deep down, she's sincere and kind with all her heart.
Next time, With That Transparent Young Girl...
Whaat?!
Good morning!
What's your name?
But since it's for Alicia-san, there's no helping it.
It's a nice scent.
Is Orange Planet a new company?
but they get as much business as companies that are 100 years old.
The new issue's out, huh?
Doing her gondola practice while on her way to school every day.
She really works hard, doesn't she.
Well, I've really come to like it too.
Okay!
Is that why you're in a bad mood?
It's okay, really.
Isn't it rude of you to keep calling her sideburns like that?
Never mind that! Hurry up and tell me about the statue!
Right, right.
There are 14 just in Piazza San Marco alone.
Controlling light and energy on that floating island
Sure, although my name still isn't Sideburns.
It must be hard balancing all this with school-work.
He's walking incredibly slowly, isn't he?
RReally?
Okay, but it's something I kinda specialize in.
The secret behind this person's smile.
Using the water as best you can.
We still have a bit of time before the last ride down."some time" reads like "sometime"
I'll join you.
Akari-san, I remember the scent of the air in Neo-Venezia.
...maybe I could even fly way up into the sky.
No way!
Even people who are far apart and can't speak to each other directly,
Yeah. I'm sure we could.
Unless they're really big feelings.
There, see? That's the power of a Single!
Isn't it a beautiful sunset, Alice-chan?
Akari-chan?
Also, could you go buy some bread at the bakery after you're done there?
That girl must be the sender, right?
Oh, there's a data card inside.
Thank you very much.
Can you wait till evening?
I never even knew this place existed.
You promise you'll deliver it?
A gift for you.
Mailman-san, how did it go?
Yeah. No luck unfortunately.
So does that mean someone could still be there?
Just leave it to me!
HuhEh? Uh... yeah!
There she goes.
What?! You gonna quit being an Undine?!
I can't believe this ocean wasn't always here.
Right!
I found you, Akari-chan!
Long ago?
so because of that, it sank into the sea.
Hey, Akari-chan! Come here! I've found it!
Well, things have been a little hectic after getting sent to Aqua so suddenly.
Wait. That place...
Nothing can stop that cat.
But I never imagined that one day I'd get the chance to actually go to Neverland!
I can't believe I just received this! It's an invitation to Neverland!
The sender isn't written.
And it also says to bring a swimsuit.
Could that be it? Is that Neverland?
I thought it was this way, but...
Nope. That's impossible.
I wonder who's behind all this.
AhOh... Maybe today we'll have to use our survival skills.
It gets your blood boiling and your muscles twitching, doesn't it?
Why are we running?
And it's not just any special training!
I understand. Also, my name is Alice.
Yeah.
This place isn't Neverland. It feels more like Never Give Up Land!
All right, then...
Oh, I'm falling.
My, my.
Both of you need to keep your balance!
The last exercise will be a competitive race!
And now, you're going to say something sappy.
Good question. For the afternoon...
What! She found such a cool place like that?!
I'm kind of tired...
My skin's rough and my body's aching.
When was it?
This one's good too. So's this, and this!
OyHey!
My, my, my, my.
You're really sexy dynamite!
When I was little, I believed Neverland was a real place.
The world looks wonderful when it's reflected in the eyes of a wonderful person.
Akari-san, I made a buttered baked potato today.
Did something happen?
Huh? What do you mean by that?
I found her abandoned three days ago.
so that just leaves you, Akari-senpai.
Oh...
Maa-kun, don't cry.
Oh, so this is the Athena-senpai I've heard so much about!
Mr. President, we're back.
Hm?
Well, I've got to get to school.
Please take it easy, Senpai.
yes, it was only 150 years ago.
That couldn't be. There's no use in assuming the worst.
We're sorry.
Athena-senpai did that?
But still, thanks to that, I stopped feeling so bad and felt warm inside.
We can ride on Akira-san's gondola?
Enjoy yourselves while you still have the chance.
I had plans to go out with my friend's family,
Plant one leg on the deck as a brace, and hang on to the posts firmly.
Akira-san! Over here!
No, actually, she was the one who insisted any gondola we ride in would have to be yours.
Who are these girls?
They're adorable! I definitely want them to come with us!
Oh, your uniforms are all different.
Wow, so lucky!
That building over there is known by all as the best theatre in Neo-Venezia.
Sir, how about enjoying Neo-Venezia with your own eyes for a bit?
How about you mind your own business!
He had a seat because he got on at the first station,
Fine.
She doesn't seem like the Akira-san I saw from before.
That's a big package, isn't it!
Please do your best!
hhUm, well, I was just really happy to see him...
OyEnough!
Wow, that's impressive, Aika-chan! You're good at explaining things.
Looks like Undines have it pretty rough.
Gondola, coming through!
Gondola, coming through!!
Hooray!
All right! And we have to get back to training.
Yes!
This season is the most difficult time of the year for us Undines.
UhAh, Aika-chan, it doesn't look like we can get through this way either.
Okay, then that way!
Dunno.
When you become Primas, no one will be there to help you.
Akari, let's go!
Here we go.
Right.
I'm worrying enough for all of us.
HuhOh? Aika-senpai?
Oy!
Next time is a double feature!
Ribbit.
Akari-san, somehow, it's like you've managed
It'd be nice if heroes like that were real, wouldn't it, President Aria?
Hey! You dropped something!
What should I do? I have to stay with these packages.
Ah! That pudgy-wudgy tummy.
Yeah. Since we Gnomes work underground,
President Maa!
All right, just keep your balance.
Wait! You can't! It's already so late.
Hurry up, you two, or you'll get left behind.
there's a bit of break from the usual workload.
President Aria?
I'm sorry, but could you please move out of the way for a moment?
Aw...!
Please don't look for me.
Let's make him ours!
I'll start preparing dinner, then.
A revised version of President Aria's special stew.
This?
But even so, there are all sorts of preparations we have to make for winter.
Sure! By all means!
and all the balls and stuff ended up rolling away.
President Aria, you're amazing.
Right...
Ken-kun came back!
Mommy, I don't care if he's dirty,
Akari-san, maybe President Aria really is a hero!
I want to meet her, I want to meet her!
No, it's not that.
she was the one who reigned at the top of Aqua's water guide industry for more than 30 years.
Wow...
Wow...
She's known as Grandmother, and is honoured as the legendary Great Water Fairy!
This will help if you're feeling tired.Alt: take away your tiredness
Nope, I have a bookingsomeone scheduled for 8 o'clock tonight.Alt: "Nuh-uh" Feels childish when reading.
Our skills are going to fall apart at this rate!
Please tell us how to be great Undines like the legendary Great Water Fairy!
Well, why not ask her yourself?
What? I wonder if I can do that.
What a superb view!
I'm Aika S. Granzchesta of the Himeya Company.
Yes ma'am! We're on it!
Ow!
All right! I'm gonna get more too!
Did you gather a lot of them?
Yes.
What should we do next?
This is important training as well, right?
Now, look here...
Even though it's autumn, the sun is bright today.
It's also full of Grandma's love too.
Okay!
Yeah! That was a great bath.
I've always slept in beds, so a futon will be new for me.
Huh?
You're a real pain!
so that Alicia-san could become the number one Undine star on Aqua, right?
Even though it's such a simple thing, everyone forgets it.
Do you find sculling your gondola fun?
Well, there you go, there's nothing I can really teach you!
Don't tell me you made it past three times?
And me.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
That's right.
You aren't good in cold weather either, are you, Akari-san?
I wonder why the trees haven't dropped all their leaves yet, even though it's so cold.
It's said they live under ash tree leaves in the spring,
Go on back to your friends, okay?
It looks like it's going to be a tough winter this year,
Yeah...
That's right. I've only ever seen them in holograms.
All right! Then we'll all go to the hot spring!
Oh...
Some of the houses have started using their fireplaces.
Right.
Thank you for your kindness!
WhaEh? Huh?!
Supposedly, when the hot spring appeared, they just let part of the house turn into a bath.
Yeah. It looks like the house of a fairy that you'd hear about in a folk tale.fairytale
My, my, my!
To tell you the truth, even on a vacation like today,
I feel like, as a Single, I should be practicing as much as possible.
This almost seems wrong somehow.
and the fire in the fireplace, I think I could come to love winter.
I can even go to a hot spring!
Hot springs are like warm gifts from the heart of Aqua, aren't they?
There's a place here that you need to see.
My heart's really pounding.
Here we go!
She does have a point.
Senpai?
Come in.
Athena-senpai.
No way!
I'm sure you'll see each other again next winter.
I'm glad.
In Neo-Venezia, they say the departure of the snowbugs heralds the first snowfall.
Because it's so cold, obviously!
So cold, especially today.
It is really freezing.
Ai-chan, this second winter I'm spending here in Neo-Venezia
Have a seat, please.
I suppose it's all right, but...
That's true.
What about it?
so I came, even though I didn't want to!Italics??
It's obvious she was embarrassed about doing it.
I hear there's a really talented girl our age over at Orange Planet!
OhEh?
Oy!
Of course! She may know that Single everyone's talking about!
Here you go, President Aria.
You don't know, huh?
Um, to your left you can seefscx150
Well, I'm a little embarrassed, but I'll sing one song.
I wanted to be better at handling my oar and talking to people,
It almost seems like those memories aren't real.
I thought those days when we trained together would last forever.
We should say, the old days were fun, as well.
I'm for it!
OhAh, President Aria's awake now.
HuhEhh?!
But Aika-chan, I didn't say anything!
I wasn't talking to you.
Huh? Sure.
Stop it, Akari!
Aika-chan...
Aika-chan! Alice-chan!
Quit it!Alt: Hey!
The things that change are important.
The things that don't are also important.
Nope, not a bit.
But not in a long time.
Yeah.
and I thought it looked like a wonderful bridge.Alt: "and I thought 'this looks like a wonderful bridge.'"
Why not go?
Oh, not at all.
Those are unusual clothes.
Yes. I work as an Undine there.
No.
Sorry to intrude.
OhEh?
Wow, that's amazing.
I have my tea out here on warm days.
Okay. This one should do. What do you think?
It looks okayfscx150
I got your hopes up, and they turned out like this!
Really?
Once the climate stabilizes a bit more, I'll be able to grow vegetables without a greenhouse.
so I bought this new card recorder, but I've dropped it twice already!
OhAhh, Akiko-san, you're a schoolteacher?
And this is President Aria.
Everyone, cut that out!
Aqua, before water flowed through the city.
Even this town will become lively.
People who never gave up despite countless failures.
It's the beginning of so many wonderful things.
How is it that water can refresh everything, even your heart?
So am I.
That's why so many people on Aqua keep cats as pets.
Akari-chan's so late.Alt: Akari-chan's taking a while.
What is it, Akari-chan?
That Sideburns has some nerve, she's late!
Sorry we're late.
The result is an incredible amount of festivities.
I wish I could show this to Ai-chan.
Yay! President Aria! Long time, no see!
From Akari-san's emails.
What a cute little kid!
I'm so happy!
I think your big brother might be a little cooler than you.
Oh, the gang's all here, huh?
What are you doing here?
I came to spend New Year's with everyone!
Hey, Akari! This girl needs to be reined in!
Yeah!
Akari!
Yeah.
That's really unclear.
Throw away?
Auguri means best wishes, and buon anno means Happy New Year!
Otto!
Quattro!
It's Aqua.
Aqua-chan?
I hope this year will be as wonderful as the last.
The baby has gotten a lot bigger from when we saw her in that photo.
Let's do our best together.
So I'm saying, why won't she go easy on me for a change?
I'm really taking it easy today.
What with all those naps you take.
and if we do things differently on this different sort of day,
Huh?
HuhEh? Why not?
It feels like you're saying I'm like an old lady.
HuhEh?
Thank you.
So you've been studying, haven't you?
Sorta.
All right.
Why should I have to apologize? Let's go, Akari!
You want to stay over?
What happens if you can't go back
Salt.
Akari! You've got rice on your face!
Man, if Akira-san were here, she'd be all...
And it doesn't end there.
but I'd sooner call her a devil.
A devil?
Well, they're all business rivals, aren't they?
I ran away like I did today, but I had no place to go.
Back then, Alicia-san was still a Single.
She secretly gave me a ride in her gondola because I was so sad.
Quiet! Knock it off!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
Okay.
That's right, the walnut bread here is Akira-san's favourite.
Akira-san just suggested the race for my sake.
I'm basically the heir to Himeya.
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
All that not allowed, not allowed stuff sounds a lot like Akira-san.
Here! This is a token of my apology!
I actually won the race.
It seems like, if the everyday scenery changes,
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
Good morning.
When you hear all sorts of sounds, you really feel that the day has begun to move, don't you?
Why do you interfere, Pigtails?
I'm not Pigtails...
Hello, thank you for your call. This is Aria Company.
Umm... I want to ride Alicia-san's gondola...
Well, hurry up, let's go.
I used to live on Man-Home too.
Ah, no, you wouldn't be.
Umm, Aika-chan, isn't it okay to be her friend?
Yep, I love it!
That's all it was, but...
Now I like Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
A wonderful miracle.
Buttered potatoes?
It's completely different to eating one on Man-Home!
Umm, isn't that...
Ah, she is Ai-chan. Umm, our friend.
I thought if I came for myself, I would like it,
They were all the same.
Especially to those you love.
That's what it is, isn't it...
I'll do my best.
They look so happy.
I bet you're dozing off right now, aren't you, Akari-san?
What with all those naps you take.
When the water reflects the blue skies of Aqua,
I think I'll probably be back by nightfall.
Well then, let's go!
This isn't working!
Then that kitty is President Hime, just as I thought!
Would you quit talking nonsense and just come in already?
WhatEh?!
Who knows...
Right...
All right.
What?!
Goodbye!
Shouldn't you go too?
You want to stay over?
After making something that looks so delicious, you might really be hired into Aria Company!
You're quite the cook, aren't you, Aika-chan?
she's one of the Three Great Water Fairies,
Yeah! And you know that very well too, Aika-chan.
Huh?
Well, they're all business rivals, aren't they?
My, my.
I'll name some right now!
My, my, my!
When we were childhood friends, I decided to be an Undine, and you copied me!
My, my! Hee-hee!
Not allowed!
Okay, go!
What do you suppose will happen?
Would you like some tea?
It's all right.
Let's just relax and head back by the scenic route.
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
She idolizes you so much that she might really try to win.
Safe!
something important that you can't normally see is revealed.
Aika-chan, who is she?
What's your name?
When did I open the window?
namioto ni yurarete While rocking to the sound of the waves,
You're right.
I'm not Pigtails...
That Wonderful Miracle...
A-ka-ri.
Undine: Water guide  Gondolier.
Umm... I want to ride Alicia-san's gondola...
Well, let's start practicing.
I know.
I'm your friend as of now.
What?
Huh? She's the one who just called...
Did you come from Man-Home by any chance?
I used to live on Man-Home too.
Are you alone--
I'm with Mom and Dad.
Why did you get on my gondola?
Are you checking up on me?
Huh? Why should I?
Right?
"Precise times and fun talks" is Himeya's motto.
Today it has been reborn as a watery planet.
I want her to come to like Neo-Venezia before she returns.
Now I like Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
Miracles?
On Man-Home, they're normally cut up.
Sure sure, thanks.
That means you're my friend, too.
I don't really like it when she boasts.
Right now I want to talk to my sister about today.
Because of you two, it looks like I've come to like this city without realizing it.
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed! For myself!
I had fun, too.
My my, I remember these two!
They started fighting in the gondola...
That's right.
yasashisa wo atatamete sotto slowly warming your kindness.
My my, is there a day that isn't fabulous for Akari-chan?
People who stand above others are tough on themselves.
Huh?
Acqua Alta?
If Aqua's blue sky was reflected in the water,
Ah, it's the gondola society meeting, isn't it?
Yep, so I'll leave things to you, Akari-chan.
Well then, let's go!
Wha...?
Splash, splash...
Huh? I don't think this is the right street.
Wow, that was sudden.
Then that kitty cat is President Hime, just as I thought!
Stop saying stuff I don't understand, and come in.
Is that the President's food?
Okay, pop quiz!
Thank you.
Ah, umm... well, today's the Acqua Alta...
Aren't you from Aria Company?
Even though you're a Single, you let a customer on...
Yeah.
Bye.
Yes!
Really?
That's right, a demon.
Aww, I thought I could spend the night with Alicia-san...
but she's staying somewhere else.
You think?
Here, done!
Well, do you feel better?
For a girl, when she changes her hair style, it changes the way she walks.
I'm serious.
One!
Alicia, why are you here?
If you have something to say to me, I'll listen.
What do you dislike?
Sure there is...
There it is...
"My my"-s aren't allowed!
My my!
My my!
My my!
Ehh?
Hey, Aika-chan...
Maybe...
Hey!
Here is my apology!
Safe!
I hope I can be like that with Alicia-san too one day.
I'm taking it easy today.
It's a flood! The floor has been flooded!
Yes!
Wha...?
...splash, splash.
I got lost.
But...
I'll take it!
Well, please do.
Don't mind if I do.
I wonder who first decided that having a blue-eyed cat as president was a symbol of assurance.
Ehh?
Wow, harsh.
Come...dian?
Geez, there's a limit to how soft that Alicia can be.
She's always been like that,
What?
If you like Alicia that much, go to Aria Company!
Shouldn't you go too?
Excuse me.
Geez, if Akira-san were here...
Orange Planet: The third most prominent gondola company in Neo-Venezia.
My my my, you must've really liked Aika-chan's cooked rice.
Aww, I thought I could spend the night with Alicia-san...
I was really down,
So to me, Alicia-san is a special being.
Swap with me, Akari!
What do you dislike?
That over-confident side of yours.
Be quiet, shut up!
Your "my my"-s are annoying too!
My?
You can eat more than me, and not put on weight!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
A race?
Eh? Why did it turn out like this?
Sure.
Walnut bread?
What...?
I didn't know this square was so beautiful.
she's straightforward and kind with all her heart.
Here is my apology!
My my!
demo furidashita ame mo But don't worry about the rain that has fallen,
ikutsumono niji koete yukeru yo Pass over the many rainbows,
I think that's probably because you haven't smiled recently.
Even though Aika-chan told me before,
On days like this, you just quietly do some easy practice.
so the difficulty is higher.
It's different to our sad Pair days when we had to wear two gloves.
Wow, amazing.
She's really good!
Interesting!
What's your name?
Hey, hey, stop, stop!
Well, yeah.
I told you embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
before you came, though.
Welcome to Orange Planet!
What a lovely gift!
Ah, Alicia-san is on the front cover this month!
She really works hard, doesn't she...
So you like this city, Undine-san?
Have you forgotten?
He was my first customer.
I'm saying, they aren't pigtails...
It was originally built when the migration to Aqua began...
Ah, that's...
Salamanders protect us day and night without rest, don't they...
Ah, yes... But I'm not Pigtails...
Akatsuki-san... To kill time during moments like these, it's good to observe people!
How can you be amused at things that don't matter like that?
Yes, well, it's something I'm good at.
Wow...
Undine girl...
Well then, guide me to the rope-way.
Not fighting the current...
Be thankful and eat.
hoho wo naderu yasashii kaze The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
The course we chose today is designed for those who are more advanced,
Fourteen.
I can't lose this one!
but they already have over 100 establishments like we do.
before you came, though.
Oh, good morning.
Excuse us, could we...?
Ah, she's leaving! What are you going to do?
I just turned her down when she asked me to sign something.
He was my first customer.
You speak too much!
Yeah, I suppose.
Ah, Alice-chan!
It's an expression of affection.
Do you wanna come too, Alice-chan?
This is the Marco Polo International Spaceport.
as the Minister of Immigration's palace for processing the people who had migrated.
It's said to represent Marco the Evangelist.
and you can find 14 of them just in San Marco Square alone.
Is it okay that you're not doing homework?
But I must meet with him!
He's unusually slow.
What are you trying to look cool for, huh?
the secret behind this person's smile.
Not at all.
If you'd like, why don't you come up to Ukijima?
Want to do some sightseeing around Ukijima?
How's your first time on Ukijima?
Nope, not at all!
chiisana hikari hoshi ni negai Wish upon a small shining star,

That Undeliverable Letter...
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
Sure.
Who are you?
Yes! Thank you very much.
I'm glad.
Ami, do we have a guest?
My my my!
I had a good look into it, but...
Hmm, that's impossible though...
One of them had the same name as the place in that address.
Thank you very much!
Do you have a handkerchief?
Item to be delivered, okay?
Yes.
Well then, take off!
I'm sure pike and mackerel feel like this when they swim, don't they...
I'd prefer you thought of it like a mermaid, if they existed, yo.
Our job is to help by riding this guy and delivering treasured feelings.
It's unbelievable that this sea didn't exist once.
There's nothing here, is there...
Let's go see, yo!
I wonder where the base is.
Only on paper though, so it was a little dangerous in the city.
And the people who were here?
I wonder why that girl had such a letter.
I don't know.
Well then, President Aria, if you please.
Only a little more until the predicted levels.
Things have been a little frantic since suddenly coming to Aqua,
I'm sure in our children's time... Aqua will be overflowing with laughter.
Ah, wait! Don't do that, Ami!
Like "The Big Embarrassing Remarks Tour"?
it's possible to deliver their feelings.
This is the ability of a Single!
Hey, wait!
Woody-san, have you finished work today?
Ai-chan, not only does Neo-Venezia have Water Fairies and Fire Keepers,
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
me wo tojite mietekuru I close my eyes, and can see...
nee tsutae you Hey, tell me...
kono tokimeki kaze ni naotte Can this yearning be healed by the wind...
Make sure you deliver it, okay?
Before telecommunication was possible,
Since Neo-Venezia still has mailmen like us around,
Thank you very much.
Eh? Ah, we should go that way?
Oh, it's you!
So when you find out the address, you'll have to deliver it straight away, right?
That address isn't used anymore.
Kai Tak Base?
Thank you very much!
Akari!
Be careful not to fall from the bike!
Yes!
You're really treating her like a child...
Yes!
Showing her panties, too...
Then where is the person from the address?
Maybe someone put it away, and she found it.
You promised her, didn't you?
Well then, President Aria, if you please.
The truth is, I want to come and see you right now... if I could.
demo furidashita ame mo But don't worry about the rain that has fallen,
kokoro ni wa itsumo ai wo The love that's always in my heart,
I wonder when you stop believing.
I have no idea.
"Come to the second shining beach on the right"?
I saw your gondola on the beach, so I thought I might meet you.
I thought I was going to be drinking iced tea on a terrace overlooking the sea.
Wow! It's a bright white sandy beach!
All right! Now that everyone is here, let's start.
Travelling over the waves and walking across the island has trained your lower body.
Listen up... To row a gondola, a strong lower body is important!
Aika, what happened to your smile?
Can you lend me your oar?
I hate to admit it, though.
Ehh?
That's right, in the afternoon...
Ah, yes. It's no longer possible to swim in Man-Home's oceans,
Attack!
I'm a wee bit tired...
It's good when there's nothing around as well, isn't it...
Grilled rice balls are cancelled!
When I was a child, I believed Neverland really existed.
I wonder when that happened...
It's a little sad, though.
I think it's okay like that.
it's not like you've thrown them away, right?
You can't throw away what's important to you.
They're kept deep within the drawer in your heart.
The sea made me remember.
Perhaps, the very planet called Aqua might be Neverland.
...to me.
hoho wo naderu yasashii kaze The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
karada no naka hodokete yuku yo I can feel my body relaxing.
kono tokimeki kaze ni naotte Can this yearning be healed by the wind...
To That Island That Shouldn't Exist...
That's right, it's intensive training until you vomit blood!
Listen up... To row a gondola, a strong lower body is important!
Hey, don't forget your balance! Your balance!
Think we should show them the ability of their seniors?
Eh? Really?
Yes.
I hate to admit it, though.
Lying together, that kinda thing...
I get the feeling that something embarrassing is about to come next,
Well then, it's lunch time!
Make sure you eat lots.
so this will be my first time going into one!
Does it feel good?
there are many, many wonderful places like this that haven't been found yet.
It's like a small paradise, isn't it?
This happened once before.
This one is done.
Make sure you eat your vegetables, too.
Huh?!
Yeah, yeah!
It's a waste to sleep.
That's right.
Thank you for inviting me today!
Eh?
The world appears wonderful in the eyes of wonderful people.
What's wrong?
It's the ribbon I lost.

Unnoticed feelings are hidden in places you can't see...

I wanted Mom and Dad to eat something yummy,
Should I help you out, since I'm older?
It's completely dependent on the right hand.
and does it with a face as if it's natural to do so...
It doesn't try to do anything.
That's why you asked me for advice?
I'm not anyone suspicious!
Umm...
I'm Mizunashi Akari of Aria Company.

Ehhh?
Umm, when did you get this water?
and presses the hang up button herself while on the phone.
Really?
It might be similar to my left hand.
Really?
Punishment.
I wonder if Maa-kun is asleep.
I'm glad.
Eh?
Well then, I'm off.
Maa-kun!
Eh?
I'm... even worse than my left hand...
I couldn't even protect Maa-kun.
Athena-senpai...
Did you notice? Even though they are small, and it's hard to tell...
It's mysterious.
Ai-chan, we all might be relying on someone without knowing it.
Join us for a fabulous time!
because they have your feelings in them!
karada no naka hodokete yuku yo I can feel my body relaxing.
The truth is, the left hand is worthless.
It's completely dependent on the right hand.
I see...
It's my roommate, Athena-senpai.
Yes, that's her.
Akari-senpai, are you going to stay over?
Umm, when did you get this water?
Really?
No.
Yes, I know.
Maa-kun!
Eh?
I'm... even worse than my left hand...
you sang then, too, didn't you?
I talked to the company...
He is going to be... Orange Planet's new president.

You won't be so happy about that later.
Join us for a fabulous time!
Akari-san, listen to this...
Akira-san! Over here!
Is it okay for them to ride with us?
Ah, you're Alice-chan, right?
You were in Mensile Undine!
Umm...
President Maa, that's a no-no.
Gallery seating is available, so you can enjoy the opera at a lower price.
It's not in any guidebooks.
Well then, we must say goodbye here at Marco Polo Square.
We will participate in the training too!
If anyone can easily become one if they are courteous and can row a boat,
All right! Let's start the individual practical training!
Yes!
Please do your best!
Wow, that's impressive, Aika-chan.
Don't forget there is a speed limit for gondolas!
Gondola coming through!
Will we be okay?
It's another corner.
fs43Gondola coming through!
All right!
It's a special caramel tea from my favorite caf.
That way is a real dead end!
It's really unexpected.
I don't know.
Yes...
Instead of saying that, why don't you tell them what to do?
Ah... The "look for locals who know the area" strategy?
And we have customers who are on their honeymoon, don't we...
All right!
I wonder if you can pass through here with a gondola...
Hey!
I might feel a little down after being scolded...
His flabby belly?
Yes, yes, I know...

Here you go.
This is certain-death customer teasing.
I'd love that!
Yes!
Umm... Can you guide us around in the afternoon as well?
Why should we?
She's kinda scary.
This is normal...
It's today's biggest, yo!
Hey!
This building is a reconstruction of the house Marco Polo grew up in.
Gondola coming through.
Gondola coming through!
My my.
Eh? Ah, no! Because she was on the front cover of the magazine...
Anyone would fall for her after seeing Alicia-san's photo in this magazine...
The most difficult time for us undines is during this season.
You're all such hard workers, aren't you...
Yes...
I'm glad, I'm glad.
It's really big!
You lot have...
to make up for getting really angry at you, she really accepts you.
but those words are filled with warm feelings...

Hey, you dropped something!
Young lady, you dropped something! Hey!
Are you shopping?
so we don't feel the effects of the seasons...
Oh, I see.
Do you know of a shop where I can rest and have a nice cup of tea?
Should I... go with you?
Err, what are you doing in that weird costume, President Aria?
Huh?
So you don't lose to that cat.
Mama, it doesn't matter that he's dirty...
Welcome back, President Aria.
I don't know. I'm not really sure myself.

Okay!
Whaa?!
it seems the happy atmosphere that surrounds Aria Company has made it all the way here.

Ah, that flabby belly must be... President Aria?
Should I... go with you?
AN EVIL ORGANIZATION AFTER OUR HERO?!
All right, keep your balance.
Mama, it doesn't matter that he's dirty...
I won't drop you anymore, okay?
I'm glad.
OF ALL THE SUNSETS SEEN BEFORE.
President Aria might really be a hero!
Just kidding.

If I'm going to grow old,
I'd like to reach a wonderful age!
I'm sure you'll be fine, Aika-chan!
Should we... be doing... this?
Don't you think that the combined training has been a little repetitive recently?
I've heard she was twice as good as any other undine.
The Legendary Great Fairy!
Ohhh.
No, I have a booking for eight o'clock tonight.
so I have to learn a lot before I return.
Hey, Akari!
Okay then...
Ah, I understand!
I really can't wait!
Sweet Potato-san, Sweet Potato-san.
Wow, it's delicious!
Okay, you three. Follow Grandma.
This feels good.
You'll sleep well tonight.
Goodnight, Grandma!
I'm sure we're all so bad that we're not worth telling,
you can only see this starry sky tonight.
Umm, Grandma, I have a request!
so you can enjoy anything.
Ah, a shooting star!
If you say a wish three times while a shooting star is falling,
U-Umm... The best in Aqua--
I want to become a wonderful woman like her one day!
Me too!
Because Akari-san's smile shines just as much as the stars in the night sky.
Hot springs, huh? I wonder what kind of place it is!
Even if they don't now, I'm sure--
You're sighing.
Yeah!
Ohhh.
Eh? I wonder if I can do that...
You have to take this seriously, too.
It's all yellow!
Pleased to meet you, Great Grandmother.
Ah, but...
The truth is, we desire to rid ourselves of our idle daily life,
Therefore we called upon you so we could receive your gracious guidance.
Okay then...
Ah, I understand!
Wow, there are lots of fallen chestnuts!
That's it! I understand!
Did you get lots?
Yes!
Unlike Man-Home, this is Grandma's hand-tended field.
Grandma is a kind person, isn't she...
Is it ready yet?
Let's do roasted chestnuts, too!
Ah, that's really--
It was really delicious!
I can smell the wood.
There's so much I want to ask...
Aika-chan, shall I wash your back?
Yes! It was a nice bath.
Not only did we miss finding out the key to becoming a great Prima...
You'll catch a cold.
Ah, thank you very much.
You're really nosy.
It is true that I did guide her, but...
But if that's it, what do you do in hard or sad times?
It truly is a wonderful thing... living each day.
You're too slow, Akari!
Me too!
mitsuketano kawaranu omoi wo You find an unchanging emotion.
It must be hard having to row a gondola in this season.
I'm gonna get up.
It really is cold.
If we can't handle this, we'll never become great Primas!
Yes?
they return to the Japanese Ash trees again to bring on winter.
Why don't we take this one back with us before they get there?
Let's buy a little more food than usual.
and Alicia-san.
Yeah...
Well then, it's about time to go home.
Yes.
My my.
Wow.
The old couple who own it have style, don't they...
Akari-chan...
It's the proper manner.
and instead of my loud, harsh senior, there's Alicia-san.
It's okay. I'm happy, so leave me alone.
Normally we would have finished our tasks and be preparing dinner, wouldn't we?
I think I can start liking winter!
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
This way.
I know a special place!
Yes, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.
Senpai...
Yeah...
It has a sweet smell.
It's kinda like a dream, isn't it...
I've really enjoyed it.
All night?
My my.
Join us for a fabulous time!
Hot springs?
Huh? You go in with other people.
mada shiranai takara mono wo the undiscovered treasure...
It's cold...
Yes, since it's become quite cold,
There will be lots of them flying around the city soon.
Yes!
Nah, when it's winter we get busy too,
so it's best to get everything out of the way now...
That's right.
Really?
Yeah, wanna drink?
Wow, I'd love some.
Do you want to knit too, Akari-chan?
Let's knit President Aria a hat and a muffler, too.
Wonderful, isn't it...
Put everything you take off in there.
Wha?!
I'm going ahead.
Eh? Ah!
Wait.
Slow and clumsy girls aren't allowed.
It's degraded quite a bit since it was a house, but...
Yes!
it's the much anticipated dinner time!
because they said we can enter the hot spring three times.
Are we there yet?
Here we go!
I think I might fall asleep again.
I've really enjoyed it.
No way!
My my.
They are returning to the Japanese Ash trees...
It's okay. I'm sure you'll meet up next winter.
Ai-chan, it's true that Aqua's winter is cold,

Don't stop halfway.
Athena-san, Akira-san!
Thanks for doing your combined training, even in this cold.
Yes.
Thanks for waiting!
Here you go.
Do the three of you always practice together?
No, that's what we should be doing.
Right?
Athena, you're laughing too much.
That's right! She might know about the rumored Single!
and it became natural for the three of us to do combined training together.
Perfect, isn't it?
We've already gone past it.
All right! Let's do canzone for today's practice!
Okay, first up is Alicia.
Okay. It's embarrassing, but I'll sing a song.
How long has it been since we've had Alicia's cocoa with fresh cream like this...
I knew that.
But... at least I'm content with how things are now.
I'm sure they intend to talk until morning.
That's the first I've heard of the three of them doing combined training together.
Goodnight!
They talked like this when they were Singles, didn't they...
hoshi tachi no uta ga of the song of the stars.
Athena-senpai, you're treating it like it's your own home.
No, there's no problem at all, but...
these two would never get around doing anything.
No, that's what we should be doing.
Just like Aika-senpai.
Faceplant?
Are you okay?!
I am Athena.
Your arms.
My arms?!
From that point on, we started practicing with Athena-chan,
Umm, to your right, wait, left...
No, it's the right, isn't it?
After that, Akira-chan started super-singing training, didn't she...
Because I wanted to be better at handling an oar and speaking,
Certainly I don't think you'll be able to stay as you are now...
since time is something that can be kind, and also cruel by changing everything.
But... at least I'm content with how things are now.
Yep, it's just like Athena-chan said.
If we were caught up in the fun of the past,
I'm sure things that are truly fun can't be compared.
If you are able to capture each of them...
I'm kinda hungry, too.
He really likes his food, doesn't he...
Wha?
Isn't it okay since it's been so long?

When I go out with President Aria,
Is this Neo-Venezia?
It's snowing again.
There's no helping it, is there...
Yesterday you said there was somewhere you wanted to go, didn't you, Akari-chan?
Have you ever been there, Alicia-san?
I saw a picture of it in a book yesterday, and I thought it was a wonderful bridge...
What's wrong, President Aria?
I'm Hoshino Akiko.
What do you think of Aqua?
Eh?
Wow... That's amazing.
I can imagine.
I'm going to pump some water later. Will you help out?
Huh?
I'm really sorry!
Hey, you said you were an "undine"?
Eh? Ah, well, we're open but not getting business at the moment.
It only snowed a little bit days ago.
Ukijima's output has been unstable recently...
A card recorder?
Ah, pleased to meet you. I'm Mizunashi Akari!
Don't poke him! It's cruel.
Gachamon?
It's so soft.
It's okay. Aqua will become a wonderful planet covered in water.
This city will finally be lively!
Delicious bakeries, small cafs...
Stay well, Akiko-san.
It's said that cats are animals that connect the past and present.
Akari-san, next time I come to Aqua,
Auguri! Boun Anno.
Next time: "That Bright White Morning..."
Are you exhausted?
This is it, isn't it...
Ah, same here. Pleased to meet you.
Sure!
Come on in.
Umm, who's Pete-san?
So it feels like I have twice as much time...
You'll stay for lunch, won't you?
What do you think?
Even though it's small, it tastes good.
Thanks.
Oh, I see.
Eh?
Yep, it's delicious.
I baked it this morning.
Is that... a job?
Eh? Ah, well, we're open but not getting business at the moment.
which is why it's been strangely warm.
It's okay... since Sensei and I are here.
Did I?
I believe it will.
Delicious bakeries, small cafs...
and cute florists... Lots of shops will be possible, won't they?

Akari-san, I came over!
Yay! Long time no see, President Aria!
Eh? Did you know that Ai-chan was coming, Alicia-san?
My brother Atsui-san won't be here until tomorrow afternoon because of work.
Pigtails...!
How is she cute--
It makes me kinda happy.
Beans are a symbol of money,
and we do that in this city, too.
E-Ehh? Ai-chan?
Demon instructor?
Hey, Aika!
I'm Al the gnome.
Umm... Gnomes regulate the gravity from underground...
Ehh?
Ah, so she's Grandma.
Thanks, Aika-chan.
A cat?
Well, that means if we follow this light, we'll be back where we started.
I'm sure they're stopping off at places along the way.
Huh? What are you saying?
Okay!
and irreplaceable precious times...
Yeah, Ai-chan!
I just woke up, too.
I wanted to see the first sunrise with her on my beloved Aqua.
My my my.
I hope this year will be a wonderful year, too.
I think so too.
It's a very bright, white and brand new world!
Have a safe trip.
Yes.
It's really nice that she brought her baby here with her, isn't it...
Auguri, Boun Anno!
So it's decided we'll do that to round off this year?
Even though it's cold, the air feels nice, doesn't it...
Ah... When I was living on Man-Home, I'd spend Christmas with everyone.

Well, I'm gonna go.
Wow, even though it's so far.
Grandma!
Have you been well?
Ai-chan?
Akari-chan, Ai-chan.
What's wrong, Akari-chan?
Nove!
Yeah, Ai-chan!
Uno!
I just woke up, too.
I've come to pick you up, Ai.
Ah, she's cute!
Aqua-chan?
That's a wonderful name, isn't it...
The sun's light is so warm.
We're going to meet up with Atsui-san in the afternoon, right?
Yeah, see you.
Have a safe trip.
Alicia-san...
Auguri, Boun Anno!
May the year that is about to start be filled with happiness!

The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
Im not Pigtails...
Since the day I arrived on Aqua, 20 months have flown by.
Dont worry about me.
Today is not so good, Im afraid.
Well, Im the only one here...
I see... Thank you.
Ah, umm...
I know.
Kidnapper... someone... save me ...is what Ill scream.
Did you come from Man-Home by any chance?
and you have to maintain these gondolas yourself too.
Aika-chan!
But since she came all this way...
Yup, I love it!
the feelings of the people who wanted to build a city gave birth to...
Do you want one?
Not really.
Ive eaten them at home before and didnt really like them...
I do.
It was delicious!
Hes gone.
Its okay, Akari has a trump card!
Fast!
I apologize for taking such a sudden, unannounced action.
My my!
Is that so? Yeah, thats right.
Ah!
Can you give this to Alicia-san later?
but if you can do that, the one you love becomes an important person.
I close my eyes, and can see
Im off.
No, youre Pigtails,
Aqua: Formerly known as Mars.
I see... Thank you.
Eh?
Ah! Yes, well...
Well, hurry up and lets go.
Thats right.
Im with Mom and Dad.
Because there are no cars, you have to walk everywhere.
Can I ask your name?
Eh, really? Thanks!
President, were going.
Ah, she is Ai-chan. Um, our friend.
Ah, thats right.
That miracle is made with effort, isnt it?
But dont worry about the rain that has fallen,
Well pass over many rainbows.
Ehehe!
People who surpass others are tough on themselves.
Tough on themselves... thats right!
This is the first time youve experienced an acqua alta, isnt it?
so everyone spends time at home relaxing.
But because of Akari-sans e-mail, a blue sky has spread through my heart.
Yes, be careful.
Yes, sure thing.
you might make a new discovery!
Oh dear!
Huh? Oh my!
Whew, that was sudden.
The acqua alta is amazing, isnt it?
Because the town looks completely different, I got lost.
You have a dignity about you that makes it feel like youre not above me.
Eh? No way!
President Himes blue eyes are always beautiful, no matter how many times I see them.
UUmm...
Well yeah, but...
But going out in a gondola on a day like this
You dont have to say it like
Aika-chan!
Well, not really
but I had nowhere to go.
Gah!
Three!
My, how unusual.
My my!
Im first!
You can eat more than me, and not put on weight!
My my! giggle giggle
Did she say childhood friend?
Not allowed! Not allowed!
Aika-chan, what are you going to do?
Want some tea?
Umm, Aika-chan, I dont think we can get through this way.
Akira-san is like the acqua alta.
Even though she is a little difficult and stubborn,
So? Just why have you two come back together all relaxed and friendly?
Suwa!
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
Youre really loud.
The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
I close my eyes, and can see
Can it ride the wind,
Yes, be careful.
you might make a new discovery!
splishity-splash!
splishity-splash!
I wonder if we can make it back.
Huh? What are you doing, Akari?
But...
Here you go.
So you have been studying.
You dont have to say it like
Aika-chan, calm down, okay?
Aika-chan, youre really good at cooking, arent you?
You really think thats the case?
My my my, you mustve really liked Aika-chans cooked rice.
It must be because of business rivalry.
but I had nowhere to go.
Eh?
Eh?
She secretly let the depressed me on her gondola,
So to me, Alicia-san is a special being.
then I would definitely have joined Aria Company!
If you stay here, my my will rub off on you.
Like Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia-san, or Alicia
My my my.
Youve always been like that!
But if she wins, she can do whatever she wants.
Eh? Why did it turn out like this?
Thats right, the walnut bread here is Akira-sans favorite.
It doesnt really matter.
When we return, its right back to practicing.
I have the feeling you can see something important that you normally cant see.
slowly warming your kindness.
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
Next time: With that transparent girl...
The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
Eh, I wonder if I can do it...
What are you saying? Were great Singles now!
Whaat?!
This is Aika-chan from Himeya.
Pleased to meet you!
I cant lose this one!
But you didnt need to pick this many!
Shes said to be a genius at handling an oar.
She admired you.
Lets go, Anna!
If youre going to be rough with an Undine, Ill tell the tourist society!
Eh?
In other words, umm, Akatsuki-san is an acquaintance
Pigtails was only about to show me around.
Please look to your right.
to be the Minister of Immigrations palace for processing the people who had migrated.
Well, I am training...
Continuing on, this is San Marco Square.
Ah, thats...
This city is dotted with them, and not just in San Marco Square either. There are 14 of them in total.
Thats why Akatsuki-san and others like you are Aquas guardian deities.
Ah, Akatsuki-san, please dont stand up!
Huh? Well...
You must have some really important business.
Do you think he will make it to his destination in time?
You!
Heres the money.
Not fighting the current...
Im sure it will come naturally.
Theres still some time before the final outbound departure,
It really is.
I might be able to fly in the sky too.
I close my eyes, and can see
Come, lets row toward the shining waves.
We soon break into a smiles.
Eh, I wonder if I can do it...
Ill show her the ability of a Single!
Im an eighth grader in middle school at the moment.
Lets give those flowers to Alicia-san as a gift!
Are our earnings top class?
Welcome!
What a lovely gift!
Oh, shes the one from before!
She really works hard, doesnt she.
Okay, lets have our snacks when we get back.
Not at all, this is nothing,
If youre going to be rough with an Undine, Ill tell the tourist society!
Pigtails was only about to show me around.
It was built... umm... huh?
Umm... err... umm...
Oh, shes a real lifesaver.
Continuing on, this is San Marco Square.
Ah, yes, yes.
The lion is one of the four winged beasts that appear in the Old Testament.
This city is dotted with them, and not just in San Marco Square either. There are 14 of them in total.
Its just like Akatsuki-san, isnt it?
But I must meet with him!
Pigtails...
Im late... Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You!
But Im surprised you waited; you usually disappear if the weathers even slightly warm.
Eh?
Theres still some time before the final outbound departure,
Its amazing.
Its like Ive become a bird and Im flying through the sky.

Ah!
Are you okay?
Eh? Me?
Please.
Is it that old?
Ill check into it when I get back to the post office.
Eh? Ah, we should go that way?
Oh, its you!
so wait just a little longer, okay?
My my my!
Yes.
Mailman-san, how did it go?
Yeah, unfortunately.
I know the approximate location.
Well, here it is.
I think theres definitely someone waiting for this letter.
Yes!
Ah, thats right.
So that means people must live around here.
Thats right, I looked up a few things from the Kai Tak Base era.
That kind of accident wasnt unusual,
So Ill forgive you.
The truth is, I want to come and see you right now, if I could.
You once said that Neo-Venezia is made of miracles...
Join us for a fabulous time!
Yay!
Since when have you two been such good friends?
UhI think youve mistaken something...
Woody-san, have you finished work today?
I can feel my body relaxing.
I close my eyes, and can see
Please wait, President Aria!
Who are you?
Eh?
Please.
Since Neo-Venezia still has mailmen like us around,
What a bright sun.
Youre the only one who has noticed me.
A gift.
My my my!
Mailman-san, how did it go?
That address isnt used anymore.
Your set of gourmet cat food is here, President.
Leave it to me!
Yes, I have it.
Well then, take off!
This feels good, doesnt it?
Ah, thats not going to happen.
Okay! Lets keep going!
It looks like the Kai Tak Base has sunk into the sea.
I wonder why that girl had such a letter.
President Aria.
What that girl wanted to deliver were these feelings.
even if its got nowhere to go.
because Ill always be by your side.

Join us for a fabulous time!
I wonder when and why you stop believing.
I never thought of it as a fairy tale.
But I never thought I would really be able to go to Neverland!
The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
Wow!
Come to the second shining beach on the right?
Well, lets go and see.
Ah, its this way, this way!
No, it has to be this way... or not?
Eh? Alice-chan!
Yup, thats impossible.
Since this is an uninhabited island, we can train you to death as much as we like!
So youre prepared?
Thats right.
I dont care if I dont improve; I just want to play!
Its really... mysterious.
Yes!
Good, Alice. Keep it up!
My my...
Im sure just being together is fun.
It sure is!
Umm, what kind of intensive training do we have after this?
Make sure you experience the real sea here at Neverland, okay, Akari-chan?
Attack!
Here we go!
Does it feel good?
Do you want to go for a walk under the sea?
Ehh?
Wow, its high.
Ah, thats right, Mom said shed buy me new ones.
Aika-chan, do you have
All right, its almost done!
Its almost like a mans cooking
Whos a man among men?!
Grilled rice balls are canceled!
No, I was just joking!
All right!
When I was a child, I believed Neverland really existed.
I cant remember.
That might be true. Its hard to imagine that humans made this landscape.
It sits quietly on the palm of my hand,
I just received this! Its an invitation to Neverland.
I have no idea.

They lure us out with the promise of showing us a dream, but then throw us into the depths of despair.
Huh?
Whats wrong, whats wrong?
Well do our best...
Akari-chan, you dont have to be so tense.
Wow, I would have liked to meet her.
Eh?
Eek! Im sorry...
Because running... barefoot on the sand... somehow feels good.
I shouldnt have come.
Youre lacking spirit! Spirit!
Good, Alice. Keep it up!
My my...
Just to rub it in, should we show them the ability of their seniors?
Eh? Really?
But its kind of nice, isnt it...
What, you say? Well, getting blisters together, lying together, that kind of thing...
We made lunch.
Its the best!
So this is the sea, right?
Since the Neo-Adriatic Sea has many islands,
Huh? Under the sea?
Embarrassing remarks arent allowed!
Lets go, Akari!
Were first!
One, two...
Im a little bit tired...
I lost one of my favorite ribbons.
What a strange feeling.
Aika-chan, do you have

No one went that far...
I wonder when that happened, when I began to think of it as a fairy tale.

I think boat rowing technique is more important for an Undine.
Its completely dependent on the right hand.
The problem is that pets arent allowed.
Probably.
Come in.
Its my roommate, Athena-senpai.
Alice-chan, dont you think Athena-senpai will find Maa-kun?
Most of our food is served here.
Sweet!
President, were back.
Maa-kun, food time.
Say, Alice-chan...
Solo Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The left hand always loses, obviously.
Eh?
Everyone must know about Maa-kun because of what happened yesterday.
The left hand has been supporting me from the shadows quite a bit.
Maa-kun!
Eh?
Thats Athena-senpais song.
Maa-kun looks relieved.
Im glad you found him.
When I first came to the dorms and couldnt sleep because I was lonely...
The blue-eyed guardian deity.
The usual scenery reflected in the water,
you find unchanging emotions.
the bluebird will one day be flapping its wings.

The truth is, the left hand is worthless.
Umm, how is that a problem?
Its really problematic!
I see...
Eh?
Wow!
Are you lonely all by yourself? ...is how it went.
I see...
Its my roommate, Athena-senpai.
Ah, this is our President Aria.
Of the Three Water Fairies, Athena-senpais canzone is especially famous.
Eh? Is that okay?
Huh?
Umm, when did you get this water?
President Aria will be staying with us in your room tonight.
Is it good, Maa-kun?
I wonder if hes lonely in the dark.
Alice-chan, the left hand might not be that useless after all.
The left hand has been supporting me from the shadows quite a bit.
Maa-kun?
Akari-senpai!
Maa-kun!
We heard a cat crying from your room, and we opened the closet.
Im worse than my left hand...
When I left them in the kitchen, Dad ate them before I realized, and he left me a note.
We can ride on Akira-sans gondola?
If its lunch youre after, we have our own right here.
the direction the wind is taking.
Id rather be instructed by Alicia-san.
While doing that, be careful that the gondola doesnt float away.
Either way, make sure you do it gracefully.
Yes!
Pleased to meet you, maam.
Come, your hand, please.
President?
Okay.
Huh?!
Im truly sorry, but in the afternoon I am doing practical training with the girls.
But well be able to see the Undine training for ourselves!
Aika!
Youre good at explaining things, arent you?
Suwa!
Aika! Im always telling you, arent I?
This is the narrowest place weve encountered so far.
It looks like were going to collide!
My my.
Eh? Ah, no! Because she was on the front cover of the magazine...
All right, well go back to the training, too.
Eh?
Just after she said that, were stuck.
I dont know.
Please be quiet and wait until its over.
Its all because I kept saying I wanted to participate.
Akari? Did you think of a good method?
It looks like well have to wait until the water level goes down after all.
I think its around dawn.
its very weak, but there seems to be a current. From over there.
Im glad.
Huh? Aika-senpai?
Oh?
Aika-chan is a crybaby!
Im glad.
A special pizza Margherita.
No! Not at all!
Even though she is so kind to customers.
Thats right!
That depressed president... That cool hero...
Yes, yes, I know. Becoming a pro is a very tough thing to do!
Aika-chan, we should be thankful that Akira-sans training is so tough!
but I was slow getting ready, and we were late.
Ai-chan, it looks like Im in the same boat as you.

Akari-chan, hey!
Sure!
Now its used as a small museum that displays articles of the deceased.
Youre good at explaining things, arent you?
It seems pretty hard for Undines too.
Hmm? Yeah...
Yup, your rowing is impressive.
Your voice is quiet.
Alicia-san!
Im so happy I get to have tea with Alicia-san!
Wow, Im so happy!
Suwa!
The most difficult time for us Undines is during this season.
Its no use after all.
And we have customers who are on their honeymoon, dont we.
Here I go.
You just concentrate on rowing carefully.
A dead end...
Im glad, Im glad!
Geez, really.
Thats right!
but those words are filled with warm feelings,
That depressed president... That cool hero...
Ai-chan, in the time between the summer and fall tourist seasons,
Its a perfect chance for Aria Company to do some cleaning!
I close my eyes, and can see
It would be nice if tomorrows weather is nice as well.
Okay!
President Aria is reading it again, isnt he?
The Nyan Nyan Pu picture book.
She cant hear me?

Wow, thats amazing.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Im already really excited to find out what kind of person she is!
According to Alicia-san, Grandmother should meet us at the station...
The truth is, we desire to rid ourselves of our idle daily life,
and become great Primas as soon as we can.
Aika-chan, youre speaking strangely.
Not really.
Ill do my best!
Yes!
Lets see...
Its fun, isnt it?
Is it ready yet? Is it ready yet?
Is it ready yet?
Ah, thats right!
Geez, Akari, you big idiot!
Its like the mountains are on fire, isnt it...
Lets eat!
This feels good.
Theyre all good girls, arent they?
My my, theyre still up.
Because Neo-Venezia is a city, the surrounding areas are bright even at night.
Youre really nosy.
but the reason shes reached her present status lies elsewhere.
Thats right.
Ah, a shooting star!
But Akari-san is wonderful too.

It seems this is recognition ability training to help instantly pick out the best from identical burrs.
Thats it, thats right!

This is really exquisite too!
Thanks for the food.
It was really delicious!
You have really sensitive skin, dont you, Aika-chan?
Sleep here tonight, okay?
Wow, tatami mats!
Youll sleep well tonight.
Its an early start tomorrow, so make sure you dont sleep in.
Im sure were all so bad that were not worth telling,
and Grandma has abandoned us.
Its true; its warm.
that she has become Aquas number one Undine star, isnt it!
Isnt it okay to think of those times as the seasoning that lets you enjoy life?
It truly is a wonderful thing, living each day.
Even though its a very simple thing, everyone forgets it.
Enjoying everything?

We Undines are professionals who fight against various degrees of hot and cold on the harsh waters of our workplace.
It we cant handle this, well never become great Primas!
My my, welcome back.
Yes, since its become quite cold,
Thats right; because the Salamanders are heating up the atmosphere from Ukijima,
All right. Well then, lets all go to a hot spring together!
Shes in a world of her own, isnt she.
Well then, its about time I went home.
Akari-chan, first hold the needle like this.
Not at all, I knew a really nice hot spring.
Ah, Alicia-san!
Ehh?
The old couple who own it have style, dont they?
Wow...
Im warm, taking it easy, and not practicing...
I was so relaxed that I fell asleep...
Being able to take it easy is the magic of hot springs.

Dont you think this is enough?
I need to sweat a little more before entering the hot spring!

Once we pass this bridge, well
Ahh! Wait!
Shes dense. Too dense...
First up is rock...
Okay, its embarrassing, but Ill sing a song.
I wont be able to practice with Akari-senpai and Aika-senpai every day or see them like I do now, will I?
Thats right, isnt it? I knew that.

lets search, Undine.
Itll warm you up.
Thank you; please excuse me.
So we decided to get together for the first time in a while.
If it wasnt for me organizing events like this all the time,
Is something wrong?
Since Aria Company always liked to keep things on a small scale,
there wasnt another apprentice in my time either.
Just like Aika-senpai.
But if there was someone like that, we shouldve found out right away...
My my my my.
It happens all the time.
Ah, my name is Akira.
I am Athena.
So you dont know? Well, you dont seem to care much for rumors.
Ahh! Wait!

Can you really bring out your voice, Athena?
Note: According to the official soundtrack, the lyrics are made up nonsense.
Because I wanted to be better at handling an oar and speaking,

If you want to schedule a gondola ride, I can-
Still, the customer might not be satisfied unless Alicia came along.
Okay, then, let's go practice!
Huh?
It's rocking, though.
Do you like gondolas?
Wait... Is this the girl who called before?
Did you come here on your own? No, wait. That can't be.
Still, it makes me happy to know I can do all that on my own.
Uh... No.
So she's a freeloader.
Then would you row, please?
Why should I?!
Because you're my friend.
All its inconveniences, how slowly things happen... Everything.
It's the baked potato stand.
Oh.
Uh, this girl's name is Ai.
You knew?
But, every place they took me was so boring.
When I get home, I'll have something to brag about to my sister!
I'm really sorry for any trouble she caused.
What? I really promise.
Yeah. So...
Someone you treasure...
so everyone just stays home and relaxes.

Splish...
Hey, Aika! What's the idea, lazing around the house like this?!
Right...
Aika, maybe you should calm down a little.
Aika, apologize!
I'm sure she'll hire you into the Aria Company after making something that looks so good.
Wow, it looks amazing!
Oh? Well, I'm not that good.
"Being an Undine isn't just the techniques!"
She's a totally different type than Alicia, huh?
Akira can be a bit severe, but the truth is she's actually very kind.
I ran away like I did today, but I had no place to go.
I never should have joined Himeya!
I'm serious.
Oh, Aika...
Anyone home?
Or else I'll drown you in the Neo-Adriatic Sea!
Two!
If there's something you want to say to me, I'm ready to listen.
I'll name some right now!
Oh, there it is. That impish little smile you specialize in.
Not allowed! Not allowed!
That's what she said.

Beyond time and space?

Agh! Now I've got brain freeze!

Who knows? There were countless bases.
Hm? And this other one is? From an orthopedic specialist?
Alicia must have bought these by mail order.
You really can't say no, can you?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Just leave it to me!

And here we are now, swimming in it like fish!
I can't believe this ocean wasn't always here.
I think I just saw something in the ocean!
The pioneer base must have sunk into the water.
Then, where could the addressee be?
Maybe that letter was mailed before news of the accident reached the writer,
But why would that little girl have a letter like that?
I don't know. Maybe someone threw it out and she found it.
Okay, President Aria, if you'd do the honors.
I haven't forgotten what you told me when we came to Aqua, Allen.
There are a lot of tough things to deal with right now,
I tried to find that canal again.
But maybe all of Aqua itself was made from a gentle miracle."
I never considered it a fantasy story at all.
"Please come to the second 'Sparkling Beach' to the right..."
It's gotta be this way! Or maybe not...
Yeah.
What should we do, Alice?
I was hoping to sip a glass of iced tea on a seaside terrace!
You're really rude.
There's no place like this, even in Neo-Venezia!
All right, now that everyone's here, shall we begin?
Um... Begin what?
In her absence, I hope you do well, Orange Planet apprentice.
Oh? I wish I could have met her.
Sorry...
Just watch your balance and row as hard as you can!
C'mon! Balance, balance!
Behold, the willpower of a Single!
What? Really?!
I hate to say it, but...
At least, that's what Alicia says.
I'll enjoy the ocean as much as I can!
Ah...
Huh?
Huh?
Aika, don't you think that's...
All right! It's just about ready!
You can't take food that's too hot, can you, Akari?
The grilled rice balls are canceled!
But when I grew up, I understood it was fantasy.
You think so?
Maybe this island really is Neverland.
Not with sadness, but with the feeling that everything was just so wonderful."
If someone's sitting there staring at your face, most people's response would be:
Exactly.
"Akari, today I made a buttered baked potato.
Alice, Alice!
Is it something that someone older, like me, can help with?
It leaves everything for the right hand to do.
Oh, and another thing...
This is Maa.
I named her that because she meows "Maa!" all the time.
I found her abandoned three days ago.
Athena, didn't I ask you to knock before coming in?
Um...
Oh, and this is Aria, our president.
Oh, so she's that Athena?!
In that case, please change into our uniform.
Um, this water... When did?
Oh, there it is.
Athena, you poured all the gum syrup into your drink again, didn't you?
Neither of them are bothered by it at all.
Oh, Athena? Could you take your bath first, please?
Is it good, Maa?
Maa looks a lot like your old president, huh?
Playing rock-paper-scissors by myself.
Sure!
the large-scale Aqua migration project began.
Maa!
Maa?
Where could Maa have gone?
What?
I couldn't even protect Maa.
Welcome home, Maa.
He left me a note about it.
I stopped feeling so bad and felt warm inside. Weird, huh?"
Enjoy yourselves while you still have the chance.
Huh?
C'mon, let's get going!
I'd rather be instructed by Alicia.
Understand? When your passengers board, have them get on one at a time, slowly.
Right. Right.
Aika, give it a try.
Sorry.
Anyway, let's be off.
There it is, her sure-fire method of flustering customers!
Brilliant.
In a streetcar on Manhome.
but he was always offering it to someone else.
Neo-Venezia is filled with many inconspicuous yet wonderful things which soothe the spirit.
In the role of customers!
That's fine with you, isn't it?
Aika, I've told you time and again.
Looks like Undines have it pretty rough.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
It... It's just because she had that article in the magazine.
The photo of Alicia on the cover... Anyone who sees it would stare at it!
Wh-wh-what'll we do?
Listen, you three. When you become Primas, no one will be there to help you.
I wonder if we'll just have to wait for the water level to go down.
Anyway, for our customers' sake, right now we'll do our best...
We really found our way out!
Thank goodness!
Miss Akira is a very strict teacher, isn't she?
but as often as she gets mad, she also acknowledges when you do well.
What defines President Aria?
That he's President Maa's favorite snack?
What a pretty sunset! Right, President Hime?
Well, that does it for the cleaning.
It'd be nice if heroes like that were real, huh, President Aria?
and all the balls and stuff ended up rolling away.
Ken came back!
I wonder who could have brought him back?
I want to meet her, I want to meet her!
If I have to get old, then I want to be a wonderful old person.
Even if no one looks up to you now, I'm sure one day, uh... Hmm.
and our bodies have gotten used to the feel of winter clothes.
I don't know. I just don't feel motivated.
At this rate, we'll never become great Primas!
Yeah!
Wow...
I've heard she's so perfect at everything that no other Undine has ever compared.
Right!
She's known as "Grandmother," and is honored as the legendary Great Water Fairy!
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
...and are on our way to meet the now-retired legendary Great Water Fairy.
Akari, Aika, and Alice, right?
Welcome, my dear Undines.
The truth is, we've all been getting lazy in our routines,
No matter how rigorous your training may be,
Huh?
I'll bet this is all a recognition judgment exercise...
This is some really tasty training she has!
Incredible!
We have to dig the potatoes out of the ground without damaging them.
Isn't it interesting? This is my homemade field, unlike what you see on Manhome.
It produces potatoes of all shapes and sizes.
Are you ready yet?
Aika, you let a sappy line through.
There's so much I want to ask her.
You're ticklish, aren't you, Aika?
Really ticklish.
Wow! Tatami mats!
Get lots of sleep tonight.
but this has turned into a vacation where we just fool around.
You're really obnoxious.
The way the stars twinkle makes it seem like they're speaking.
Look, Grandma, I beg of you!
but the reason she's where she is now is entirely different.
That... That's all there is to it?
Yes!
What?! Really?!
Oh, it went out.
No, it went out while I was saying it the third time.
Yeah.
Me too.
Your smile shines clearer than the stars in the night sky...
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
and on cold mornings, I wish I could just hibernate.
You're lucky you're a Pair. Both your hands are covered.
My, my! Welcome back.
Yeah!
The snowbugs on Aqua are many times larger than the ones on Manhome.
Everyone's getting ready for winter, huh?
Oh, Mr. Mailman!
Hello!
Okay Akari, first, hold the knitting needles like this...
Oh, not at all! I just happened to know a really nice hot spring!
This way, please.
Right!
Wait! Wait!
Right.
Usually, we would have finished work and have started dinner by now.
but with this cute snowbug,
We're here!
Alicia, don't tell me you've been to this hot spring before?
I invited them.
Good evening.
Maybe we should stop...
Shall we go back inside?
Someday, when we're no longer Singles...
On a day like this, I expect those silver angels to appear again..."
Ah, it looks like they're back.
My, my, my!
Shouldn't we be here?
Wha?!
Here we go!
What is with you?!
Hey!
She goes at her own pace, doesn't she?
You shouldn't lie down right after eating.
The food might end up in weird places.
Gondola, coming-
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, just stop!
My, my, my.
All right!
You're the Single everyone's talking about!
So, Athena was the Single you'd heard about.
Yeah.
Someday...
No... sappy lines...
Shall I make us some more cocoa?
Akari, say goodnight to Akira and the others for me.
You two are really loud.
Maybe what others see as just an old bridge,
Your president is a cat? And what's an "Undine?"
No sappy lines allowed.
Do people say stuff like that to you?
I built this wood deck myself.
So welcome, to my sunny caf.
With a menu of sincerity and tranquility, right?
Of course. I'm making stuffed cabbage.
What? You don't know?
I think so.
Oh, I knew an amateur like me shouldn't have tried this!
I got your hopes up, and they turned out like this!
Oh! Um... Sorry.
So, you're an Undine?
I give tours through the city on a gondola.
It's been really cold lately, since Ukijima's output has been kind of unstable.
but I've dropped it twice already!
Uh-huh!
Gachamon?! Gachamon?!
It will. Aqua will become a beautiful world covered with water.
Akari.
You'll be able to run them all yourself, Akiko!
I feel like the planet's finally saying it's okay for us to live on this world.
We've been accepted by Aqua itself.
Well, it's about time for me to go.
Take care, Akiko.
I will.
That's why so many people on Aqua keep cats as pets.
Akari's so late.
Okay.
Next time, "That White Morning..."
It's a little sad that it's all over,
My second New Year's Eve since coming to Aqua has arrived."
But in Neo-Venezia it's the opposite. Christmas with family, New Year's with everyone.
My, my.
Yay! President Aria! Long time, no see!
Oh, you must be Mr. Akatsuki the Salamander!
Why does she know so much about us?
...to keep Aqua comfortable for the people who live here, right?
Oh, boy...
Oh, the gang's all here, huh?
What's this all about, Aika?
Uh, it's just a misunderstanding! Akari, what do you put in those e-mails to Ai?!
Akari, this girl needs to be reined in!
I'm so happy for her.
Oh, what a darling little girl. A friend of yours, Akari?
Yes, this is Ai. She's from Manhome.
That's our respected elder, the one who founded the Aria Company.
Mr. President!
President Aria!
Let's go, Ai.
I'm glad.
Same with me... Even though I don't know anything about that time.
We're back!
Where did you go?
Huh? What do you mean? This whole planet is Aqua.
Then I'll... throw this.
I wore it because I was coming back.
I'm a spoiled person, aren't I?
Uno!
Ai, look behind you.
How do you do? What's her name?
Aqua...
My, my! That's great, Aqua!
No sappy lines allowed.
I'm sure it will be.
And the colors it will be painted with are up to us.
See you later, Akari.
Yeah. See you later.
Hope to see you again!
Take care!
Ai and her sister seemed very happy.
Yes.
Yes. It's wonderful how both our families have grown since we last saw each other.
May this be a good year as well.
...I say, with my heart full of thanks:
Today is Carnevale...
I think, for you...
For the sake of justice, Lai Lala Lai Lai Lai!
I don't think you were invited.
Gachapen?
For some reason, you remind me of it.
He was also a writer, and an adventurer who's famous to this day.
You're probably just overwhelmed by all the excitement.
You'll feel better in no time.
Ai, you're heading back to Manhome tomorrow, right?
One of the child attendants who was parading with Casanova...
There's no one here.
Aika?
Alice?
Oh no! Are we lost, Akari?
Huh? What's this?
Do you think it's okay?
Let's go!
Zun-taka poko-ten zun-taka pon!
Aika!
Hey, have you seen Akari?
No way!
My, my.
Come to think of it, Casanova wore jasmine cologne.
Well? Well?
Did you find out Casanova's identity?
...if you let your inhibitions go and open your arms wide,
Because humans aren't the only ones looking for new encounters.
We'll sail the seven seas to find our treasure!
"Ai, after you went back to Manhome,
the days continued to be cold and wintery in Neo-Venezia.
What should I do?"
Yay! A break!
Something just caught my attention.
What? Is that a door there?
Calle?
It's also right near here.
It's really intriguing, don't you think?
Look, there's the long boot shop.
Nothing.
Huh?
Isn't that an old person's hobby?
Wha?
It's really a mystery.
Huh?
Huh? What, what?
I could never bring myself to go in...
Thank you for waiting.
Huh? That old man...
The sun deteriorates the flavor of the wine, so in order to avoid that,
M-Me too!
Yes, you could drink it all day.
Yes, almost every day.
Is something wrong?
Ah, no.
Please excuse me.
There it is!
Yes, thank you!
There it is!
I wonder how many more there are?
He's running?
It's that tummy...
Look! It's the exit!
...really on the mark!
Not at all.
Compared to yesterday, the temperature is...
Umm... then gravity...
It's quiet and cozy. It's a nice place.
It's close by. Let's go!
Please, don't worry about it.
I'd forgotten about that.
Oh, the hot pot looks ready.
Huh?
Let's do that, let's do that.
It's fine!
Yeah.
Good evening!
We're wandering in search of the meteor shower, so that makes us...
Um, that was supposed to be an old pun from Manhome, using "hoshi" and "hoshii"...
Aika, is something wrong?
Akari, what's gotten into you?
Zun zun, zun zun!
Oh...
Oh, so you wouldn't see it if there wasn't any air.
That's right.
It's amazing...
I can sort of understand...
Aika?
No sappy lines allowed!
Huh?
"Akari, the gravity part was a little complicated, but...
Or letters requesting a duel?
...to me, this job is more like a hobby than work.
It's two birds with one stone!
I'm here to help Mr. Mailman today.
It smells like ink.
You're welcome to join in.
Not bad at all for your first time!
Thank you very much.
We have deliveries in the afternoon as well.
...I also wrote "I'm sorry."
Sora! That's a nice name.
I'm going to back-paddle.
Yes.
Okay!
Hope you have a happy life, Ayano!
Thank you!
Miss Ayano, congratulations on your marriage.
Wishing you all the happiness in the world, Sora."
Yeah, thanks.
Yes.
I wonder if I was a good teacher to him?
Sure. Take care, Sora.
Yeah. For some reason, the people in this city still prefer to send letters.
It's probably because the heart doesn't catch up when it's sent in haste.
It brings back that excitement from when you were a child.
Signed, Mr. Mailman."
That's amazing!
He's the guardian deity of this shrine.
But be careful...
What's wrong, Akari?
It's called a "sun shower."
Another wonderful name? I wonder what it could be?
Let's find some shelter first.
It's not my imagination.
Something has been following us for a while...
Good morning.
I feel like we're an exploration party. I'm so excited!
Wha-? The entrance?
My, my.
It's time for lunch, President Aria!
What is it, Akari?
This is kind of wonderful...
Ahh... They're so tiny, but they're hardworking flowers, aren't they?
Shall we start heading back?
Sure.
Akari!
We found it!
I'm envious of you too, Akari.
Morning!
Morning.
Morning!
Alice!
Hmph.
Wha-What!
Aika, we should head out soon.
It's so beautiful, I bet fairies gather here to have a secret ball at night.
It's cold...
Huh?
Our company has events from time to time, as well.
They were so courteous.
As you can see, they're Pairs from our company.
I'm going back to my room.
It's quite the opposite.
Even if you can't get on the bed by yourself, you're still President Maa.
Ah, off you go...
Besides...
I already said it's okay.
I see.
It is fun.
I can relax and have fun when I'm around them.
Of course you can.
Smile at them.
You did it, President Maa!
Maybe I'll try a little harder, too.
Huh?
Good morning!
Okay. I have to go to school, so...
Aika, my cheeks...
Ai-chan, this is my second summer since coming to Aqua.
and before I know it, I'm dripping with sweat.
On days like this, you want to take things easy, and not exert yourself.
I'm an eighth grader in middle school at the moment.
They're gonna hold onto it too.
The new issue's out, huh?
Doing her gondola practice while on her way to school every day...
Smile?
Come on, let's get home and have these as a snack!
because Alicia-san is with us.
That's the person from this morning.
Trouble?!
I keep telling you, they're not sideburns...
It's okay, really.
Continuing on, this is Piazza San Marco.
Huh? OhAh, that.
and they protect the peace of the places where they appear.
... and regulating the planet's weather so it's comfortable is your job, right?
Sure, although my name still isn't Sideburns...
Huh? Well...
Sideburns...
Alice-chan laughed!
Now I get it.
for sure, it will come to you naturally.
That's the first time you've used my name, Alice-chan.
I've got employee tickets.
We still have some time before the last ride down.
This is my first time to Ukijima.
So? How do you like your first visit to Ukijima?
Was that a little too sappy?
I'd still really leave it alone.
Ah, that's right.
Are you here?
Alice, how was the Pair party?
Well, I guess you could say I did...
Wha-!
I'm not gonna lose to Junior here!
Huh?
Ah, that's right.
Aika, let's not do this today.
Huh? I don't see President Aria.
Talk about a narrow canal.
I don't know...
Is this where the cat meeting is?
This place is abandoned! There's no one here!
Ah, you're right!
Anyway, let's keep following him!
You've never come this way before, right, Aika?
Maybe we really should turn around...
Well, someone's calling me, so...
I wonder if we'll ever be able to go back home?
I wonder if we're being punished for trying to see the cat meeting...
We probably weren't supposed to come here...
He'll be fine.
That's true...
What a beautiful day.
You're going to the Gondola Association meeting, right?
Yeah.
Because today is the day when a man gives a single rose to his love!
You fool!
Hey.
Hey, Sideburns!
Yeah.
Wait a sec, Pony-boy. Those roses...
So that's how you want to play?
Hey, Akari! Hello!
Akira's amazing, isn't she?
Sorry, put it on my tab.
That's right!
So that's how it started...
What a poor fellow.
Both the lady and young man lived hundreds of years ago, but...
It is, yeah...
What is it?
Ah, I see Akatsuki is with you, too.
Whoa, what's all this, Akatsuki?
I saw Woody earlier. He was delivering a bunch of roses to Akira from her fans.
Hey, Sideburns!
Yes?
I'll see you later, Aika!
Uh... Umm...
Say, Alicia.
Is the Gondola Association meeting over, Alicia?
I wonder if I interrupted something?
She can't hear you...
Akatsuki...
Here.
Ah, that's right.
I'm sure the red gem will look lovely on you.
Red-boned ribs! akai baraniku
Jeez.
S-So, shall we head back, then?
You never know when the advancement exam might be.
Yes!
But I'm surprised you noticed!
But why does it make this sound?
Well, yes.
Ah, yes.
What was that, President?
Um, I'm really sorry.
Y-Yes!
There, we're done!
Why don't you go take one too, Akari?
The bathroom is out of this world too.
Don't you think it's fitting for a tea party that's out of this world?
It's a match made in heaven.
There are so many things I still don't know...
Always continue to burn that small, warm flame.
We've been talking for a while.
Alicia!
...somehow it feels very wondrous and mysterious.
But...
You can really feel the city become lively."
Voila! I found it!
Yes, thanks again.
Of course, and thank you for the salad!
Ah, that's right. I have to leave after this.
Aren't you curious about how she makes friends when we're not around?
Really count me in.
I'm going to Burano Island to do some shopping.
Do you think we'll find out the secret behind Akari's mysterious personality?
You know... I'm getting kind of sleepy.
Yeah...
Hmm, how do I describe it...
It's from the mystery book I read yesterday.
H-Hey!
It's fine to make friends with people you don't know, but...
I think we should.
You're right. Okay, then let's...
We have no choice!
R-Right. Let's split up, then.
Thank you, President Aria!
What he's doing?
I saw it when I was little...
The doll and the traveling man...
It was really fun...
We followed Akari and stumbled upon on our own forgotten memory.
How should I say it...
When you look through the Akari filter,
She's so mysterious, isn't she? That Akari...
What are you guys doing here?
Huh?
"Ai, something amazing happened today!"
Huh?
Ah, no, I'm fine.
It really happened!
I'm not actually looking for a tour guide.
...your gondola moves at a snail's pace, and is the slowest gondola in all of Neo-Venezia.
That's why I came to ask you.
The delivery is tomorrow...
You're off to a good start, Akari.
Yes.
Yeah, it doesn't compare to the real thing.
This must be the workshop.
Then why don't we check the contents of the finished boxes in the meantime?
Glass is very delicate.
No thanks.
Ow!
Akari.
It's very beautiful, how they sparkle in so many different colors.
My, my. You've never had it before, have you, Akari?
I'm glad I baked it, then.
But it's impressive that people are already requesting you.
It's kind of embarrassing when you say it like that.
When Manhome's Venice was submerged,
I'm sorry about what I said back at the workshop.
Yes! Thank you very much!
Next time I'd like to go to the workshop and see the plates and glasses, too.
It's hot.
Goodbye!
Yes.
Ah...
They say cats spend two-thirds of their lives asleep.
But when it's this hot, you can't help but feel light-headed.
Huh?
Hello.
When I looked around, everyone in the city was gone. I thought I had wandered into a dream.
But there's nothing to worry about. You'll be cool here...
This is our secret hideout during the summer.
Iced milk in the afternoon...
Night-shine gems are only found in Aqua's ocean,
You picked one already?
This inexplicable feeling came over me.
No sappy lines allowed!
You came to buy one too, Alice?
Mmm, it's cold!
And sweet.
Let's row out tonight and say goodbye.
Here you go, Alicia.
Tante grazie.
Tante grazie.
My!
Huh?
Why am I...
My, my. Aika, Alice.
Good, I'm glad. You should smile, then!
I'm going to succeed today!
Athena.
...you sing that a lot lately.
Yes.
...while staying on the lines between the stone pavement.
I failed before, but it's the challenge that keeps me going!
I didn't know you had such a rule...
Umm...
Alice, where are you going?
I'm going to redo it!
This is dumb.
I wonder if that was also because of Athena's song?"
Maybe I'll try to make it home by only stepping on shadows tomorrow, too!
So then, so then! What color do you think I am?
Shall we start heading back, President Aria?
Now that you mention it, you're right...
I had a very successful corn harvest this year.
Ah! I'm sorry, President Aria!
Let's give it our best, President Aria.
Yup, I will!
Do I have paint on my face?
Good work.
Someday, after I've retired...
She may have retired as an Undine, but...
...her heart at the time she drew that design, was here to guide you.
That will never, ever change.
It represents you as you are now, Akari.
Now, now.
Wha-!
"At the request of a cat-loving customer, he's working with Alicia.
It's so beautiful...
The weather's really nice, isn't it?
Yeah.
But, after looking at it for a while,
I begin to feel like I'm all alone in the middle of the sky...
Akatsuki!
Oh, yes... That's right...
That sounds nice, too...
Say "ahh."
Ahh.
Now, now, now, you two.
You're amazing, Akatsukin!
We want to play, too!
Really?!
Why you! Just who are you?!
I challenge you to a duel!
Right now, this very spot...
Well, see you down there!
This is awesome!
Hey! Hurry up!
Are you okay?
That's too cruel!
...at a pathetic loser... like me...
It's obvious that I lost, no matter how you look at it.
This is for Aqua's peace...
Understand? Listen up...
...I wonder what's doing, wherever he is?
I should have known that lovely little lady was you, Alicia.
...m- m-my h-h-heart... w-w-would r-r-raceee...
I was just thinking... how nice it must be.
Akari?
...that large circle never changes, and it surrounds this city and those within it.
Yes! I'm sorry!
You didn't realize it?
Hmm...
If you have an encounter, there'll always come a day when you have to say goodbye, right?
That's what would make the gondola happiest, don't you think?
I'm sure that will make the gondola happy.
Wow, a real gondola!
Weather, good!
Have a safe trip.
Akatsuki!
...so it's getting replaced with a new gondola.
I'll retrace the route we took on our first ride, Akatsuki.
Akari, you have a customer?
Junior and I are the next guests on the tour.
Okay!
I had no idea back then, either.
Sir, if you please!
I've really come to love this long, relaxing moment.
You can see all of Neo-Venezia from here.
Really, Alicia?
Yes.
Huh?
Huh?
It's the same as when I sculled this gondola for the first time.
Thank you very much for today!
Akari?
Alicia, that's the gondola you'll be using.
It's as if you're gliding above the water.
A rainbow!
Yes!
Hey!
Right!
Ah... Uhh... Umm... Er...
It's true! It's the same photo!
Yeah.
I'll go get the camera, then.
Who else would it be?
When I met you for the first time...
When I first came to Aqua, I didn't know anything...
...but you gave me countless "firsts."
Yes!
That's not true!
What's with you? You're already exhausted.
Is that okay, though?
Well, why don't we start cooking, too?
Yes.
Here come the vegetables!
What?
I might just discover a new me!
Wha-!
Here, hurry up and eat. Here you go.
My, my.
Take-our-time!
Are they ready?
Do you smell something strange?
Huh?
Sorry! Please excuse us, too!
It's really good.
What about the grilled rice balls?
Yeah, but...
Oh, whatever...
but it'll look awkward if it's not lined up with the part that was burned, right?
Go for it.
Aika, that's a good look for you.
It's impossible for you to be Alicia.
Understand?
You have to make yourself the greatest Undine there ever was in Neo-Venezia!
Ow.
It's kind of a do-over, but please enjoy.
Aika, you look wonder-beautiful!
What's the matter, Aika?
You really have bed hair.
But it was fine just a minute ago!
Good night.
I started to feel better in the evening, but...
At this rate, I'm going to get boredom sickness!
This is the best!
Go home!
You mean you weren't serious before?
Do you want to have some with us?
Junior doesn't have school today,
See? You look lovely.
...more than these two.
The quiet and unsociable Alice...
...she's so scatterbrained, she goes straight into "wonderful mode."
...today, I'm the one... who's feeling scatterbrained.
I have to stay focused until we finish practice!
...I've been wanting to show Al.
And, umm, umm, also...
We'll be fine so please just go already.
Why do I want Al to see my new hairstyle? I don't really know, myself.
Did you come all this way to see Al?
It-It-It's nothing important!
...I'm also kind of happy.
No sappy lines allowed!
No scary stories allowed!
But really, it's not cold at all.
But we can appreciate cool things because it's hot, right?
President Aria.
It's important to rest up, especially when you're getting over a cold.
Aika.
I don't want to hear any scary stories! They're scary.
If a city gondolier happened to be alone at night, near the pillars,
I'm sorry I'm really late.
Huh?!
Good practice.
All the other gondolas seem to have finished for the day.
Well then, where would you like to go?
"You must never go with her."
You really are a good girl.
Then...
My, my.
But it might have been a dream...
Did you know that there's more to that ghost story?
Yes.
It doesn't make sense!
Huh?
Not many people come this way, so it's a great hidden spot, don't you think?
Akari, make sure you're careful!
Akari Mizunashi?
W-W-Wha-! Akari!
Then what kind of guy is he?
Somehow, I just feel at ease around him.
He has a very fine coat of fur...
He's much bigger...
It seems dangerous.
...my mysterious encounters, and Cait Sith...
Akari, you want to encounter the many mysteries and wonders of Aqua.
You're all set to go, aren't you President Aria?
You're the one who saved me on the graveyard island, right?
Maybe he stamped you, hoping you wouldn't forget your encounter?
"Ai, it was an excitement like I've never felt before!
Imagine if you somehow got yourself drawn into that world...
For example, there could be a world full of adventures.
I thought I just heard a familiar scream...
Eh? Really?
You can still reverse the damage!
We just happened to bump into each other...
Wha? Knock it off, Pony-girl!
Now, now. Both of you, calm down.
What's the matter, President Aria?
What's the matter?
My, oh, my. May I try, too?
I was worried because he disappeared so suddenly.
But the 'what if' situations I usually think about involve my future.
He's been really helpful with things like this!
I doubt that.
Ah.
My, my.
I'm home.
Whoa, awesome! It's BariBari-kun!
I'm making sure mother hasn't been kidnapped and replaced with an evil alien.
Welcome, Akatsuki.
Yes.
Hey! Sideburns!
I can't wait!"
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
If you don't mind, I might just do that, then.
Umm...
Umm...
and then the Doge drops a ring into the sea.
They use a special ship called the Bucintoro for that.
What a selfish little man.
A gondola and music...
It's not all right!
She's a busybody girl.
My!
I'm not the only one.
Hey!
It reminded me of the Marriage to the Sea.
You're always saving me, aren't you?
Neo-Venezia has always been, and always will be...
Y... Yeah.
Maybe precious feelings are something that you have to nurture over time?
...but I'll try praying that she gets better soon!"
The long summer has finally come to an end,
"The days are gradually becoming shorter,
Here for the usual rainy day study session?
Let's start, let's start!
Ahh, yeah, reports are a pain, so people tend to put them on the back burner.
Ow!
Yes!
That's exactly right.
No sappy aliases allowed.
We were just getting into our study session, so...
So when they inherited an alias, it also meant they were inheriting the privilege to do business.
We understand.
You're really famous!
Never mind that. We have to organize those files!
Wow, we're finally done.
That really was a lot of work.
Jeez, I can't believe she made us do all this.
Like we didn't know that already.
Akira's wonderful, isn't she?
Hide, hide, hide...
They were looking at Akira, and badmouthing her.
She started from nothing and became a Prima at Himeya by her own strength.
Hey, Aika.
...it's also painfully competitive.
Dealing with that is also part of my job.
...the guests could only think about that fall.
The bride was thoroughly depressed.
You crying for me is enough.
Because I'm...
Yeah, lots more!
I'm sure that's it.
But Redentore festivities go all night long.
You three will be the ones doing the inviting.
It's your chance to show us that you can handle entertaining a lot of people at once.
Did you come directly from school?
I'll do my best too, Alice!
Mr. Mailman, Akatsuki, Woody and...
Eh?
I totally agree!
Yeah, Redentore is in a week.
What if... no one comes...
Thanks for the invitation!
Welcome!
My, my. Good evening.
Really?
Ah, Al!
Here, these are muscat grapes from my garden.
You're right...
Akari!
I'm sorry. I brought her along on my business trip, but we ended up arriving later than we expected.
I'm Atsushi, her husband.
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Wow, it looks delicious!
You guys did a pretty good job with the presentation.
Cheers!
Ah, that was supposed to be a pun using "kamo" and "kamo"...
Aika.
Thanks to the three of you, we had a very enjoyable Redentore.
The scent of Aqua...
It's because everyone has something beautiful kept close inside their hearts.
It's as if the entire city has been given a new coat of paint for the approaching new year."
Here. You too, Alice.
Hello? Akari?
What?
Why don't we go for a walk, Akari?
Alicia, when you were a child, what kind of adult did you want to be?
Huh?
Alicia?
I'll help.
Thank you.
It really has.
Ah...
Thank you very much.
Here we... go!
It'll be incredible, no matter where you put it!
It's a dead end, isn't it?
Yes!
We're sorry! We'll move it right away.
I'm sure your hands are cold, too.
Once it's done, we'll decorate it with these!
Yes, it's really nice!
Well...
To this planet, which has given me so many precious encounters...
Yes, it's just another peaceful day on Aqua.
Old Man Apa, I was given some delicious rice cakes.
Hey, Aika. Want to go get some pizza?
You're always mellow, though.
Things were really lively right up until yesterday, when it ended.
I guess I still have a long way to go before I can become a Prima."
Gondola coming through!
...I've been working nonstop these past few days, so I'm really... sleep... y...
Yay!
We're having a study session today.
Get another cup for us, too.
Here's a glass of water, Akari.
...that the city is gradually changing its colors.
Yes!
Seeing Neo-Venezia after Carnevale...
Did you catch any fi...
My, my. Welcome.
This is the first time I've had cherry jam.
And straight across is the Piazzetta of Piazza San Marco.
Neo-Venezia really is a wonderful place, isn't it?
My hand?
Oh, my!
It's beautiful.
Listen, would you just...
Whoa!
Y... Yes...
If I had snapped then, they probably wouldn't have remembered their vacation as fondly.
Yes, about how you're really clumsy.
Thank you for having me!
Right?
Their own brilliance...
Maybe it's best to just cherish yourself and the long journey ahead, and have fun along the way?
Do you remember?
You're really strict, Aika.
We're definitely going to become the brightest stars!
Yeah.
Okay!
If you're ever in trouble, just shift your "wonderful" power into overdrive and do your best, okay?
That was really fun!
It's just that I couldn't decide today's route until this morning.
This customer could be the legendary surprise examiner.
Please try not to fail, okay?
Okay. Thank you, Aika, Alice.
I marked my chosen guide route on a map yesterday.
Found it!
Pleased to meet you, too.
Please watch your step.
Excuse us.
Why don't you sit next me?
I've visited this city several times, so I've already seen all the major sightseeing spots.
No, I'll accompany you.
Please notice the statue on the roof.
Akari?
Well then, allow me take you to our next destination.
Thank you very much.
Everyone's a big fan of Neo-Venezia.
It's delicious.
Does it taste bad? I thought I chose a good new butter, but...
Our scheduled time is almost up.
Ah, yes. It is, isn't it?
Ehh?! N-No way!
This is the back garden of a convent,
which was submerged and abandoned when the water level rose.
Akari.
You showed me so many places today, and I was able to feel your heart in all of them.
I guided Ms. Amarantha when I was a Single, too.
No, as though all of Aqua was watching over me."
Maybe it was Aqua itself that sent her to you.
It smells delicious.
My, my, President Aria. You're in a good mood this morning.
Speaking of buildings brought over from Manhome, Caff Florian was brought over too, right?
Yes. You can really get a sense of its long history from the beautiful rooms inside.
Oh yeah, last month they started restoration work on this building too, didn't they?
Wow... Those are such big paintings...
Because in a sense, the wraps will be the city's face while they do the restoration.
Are those bottled sweets?
Each room has its own theme, like the Room of the Illustrious Men and the Room of Seasons.
It's really delicious.
The entire caf is like an art museum.
But, but! There is a difference!
He was staring at Ca' d'Oro just now, as well.
I'm going straight to the Gondola Association for a meeting now.
This place never ceases to amaze me.
Huh?
There's something I'd like to give you.
Miss Undine!
They're so cute!
Please, pick any two you like, for you and your cat.
So they're that old...
It's just a simple phrase, but there's a lot of meaning in those words.
they're both the same because they were made with love!
I see...
Thank you for treating us.
Don't worry! I'm sure Alicia isn't bothered by it, even if you are useless.
President Aria...
She only gets one day off a month, if that.
What's the matter?
I want to be even more useful to the company.
Singles from different companies are paired up, so it's something of an attraction in Neo-Venezia."
Yes! I'm still just an apprentice, but!
Huh? Where'd everyone go?
When you're nervous, having something in your stomach helps calm you down.
Hmm... Yeah, perhaps.
and whoever's on shore will give her a lecture?
Ah, yes!
Even though she's disappointed every time, she continues to challenge herself and retake it.
A mentor from your company acts as the examiner, so the difficulty varies,
It doesn't, though.
The traghetto may serve as a training ground for Singles hoping to become Primas,
Someday if I do get to take the exam and I happen to fail it...
Okay!
Be careful on your way to the office, okay?
Besides, we're the ones who should be happy.
You really helped us out.
Cut it out, Anzu!
You end up unable to absorb anything.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
The traghetto.
I'm back!
My, my. Welcome back, Akari. Good work today.
"You sculled a traghetto, huh? I'd like to give it a ride.
Hey, what do you think of Akira?
"Dear Ai, it's been so warm here in Neo-Venezia lately that I find myself breaking into a sweat.
Oh yeah, Akari.
I heard you worked on a traghetto recently?
After it was over, it motivated me to work even harder.
I can't afford to lose to you!
Now that we've changed into our summer uniforms, let's give it all we've got during practice!
Her voice is wonderful, no matter how many times you hear it.
Her voice truly is heavenly, isn't it?
True, Athena's voice is one in a hundred...
Is something wrong, Aika?
Yes, thank you very much!
...or a hard worker.
I'm... not... going to... help...
How can you...
It was difficult, wasn't it? It was painful, wasn't it?!
That's all.
Wasn't it hard for you?
...and they're also my friends.
Thank you.
Yup! Leave it to me!
The sky is so blue...
Clover?
Am I really one of the unblessed?
You don't have... what you don't have...
I like this kind a lot better!
I'll treasure it!
Now, please take my hand.
The scenery here never seems to change.
The rain finally let up yesterday, so I think we have a good chance.
It's full of laundry, just like we thought!
Honestly...
Here's your chitarra.
Okay!
Why don't we try going this way?
Huh? She's gone.
Which way did she go?
I guess I lost her.
What is she doing?
Then I'll send the RSVPs for both of us.
Huh? It won't open.
I will!
Want to go see?
But strangely, no one ever notices this spot.
You see this person in secret?
Ah, but President Aria is with us, too.
Let's make this our secret base.
And President Aria's, and that guy's, too!
Now now, don't mind us. Go on, go on.
Hold it right there!
I'm sure that I will, too."
This is really a mystery!
Hey, Akari! No playing around allowed!
Th-that's right...
Huh?
Nope.
W-What are you doing, Alice?
A-Ah, yes...
I'm happy for you, Aika-
Alice?
But...
Same one, please.
Now that you mention it...
Isn't it strange, considering how long we've known each other?
W-W-What do you mean?
I knew it, she saw right threw me!
In that case... Go for broke!
I was wondering why that is.
Ah, yes...
I wouldn't shout, "Not that way, not that way!"
I'd keep shouting, "This way, this way!"
If I kept shouting, "not that way," President Aria would become afraid of making mistakes.
Eventually, I don't think he'd be able to move.
As a mentor, when you instruct your apprentice...
Please scold me.
"I wish my mother was like Alicia.
President Aria, come to think of it, how long have you been with the Aria Company?
When you're gazing out at the sea, surrounded by the sound of waves...
...you lose track of time, don't you?
So lace was developed from the art of weaving nets.
Long time no see, Alicia.
H-Hello.
Mom's getting lessons from her right now.
Not at all, Anna. Congratulations.
It was a happy marriage, wasn't it?
Getting married and moving was fine, but life here was completely different from my life as an Undine.
My, my, President Aria.
This looks amazing!
Okay, let's dig in!
Yummy!
I see you have your feet firmly on the ground, and cherish every day.
Thank you very much.
Are you lost, by chance?
We're all looking forward to your Aria Company, which will be unlike anything we've seen before.
Yes, I'll do my best!
My, my.
...because of the thoughts, wishes and kindness of many people.
Yes! I wish I could gather every single one and keep them in a treasure box.
You're going with Athena...
Yes, we're going tomorrow.
I invited Athena.
Well, I guess picnics are nice once in a while.
Me too.
Yes, yes.
President Maa, it's still a little early, but let's go take a bath and warm ourselves up!
It's not her fault...
Akari, I'll clean this up, so could you get it please?
Th?
Here.
And one for you, too.
Athena-
Who might you be?
My, my. Did it seem like magic?
Now that I've calmed down, I just had a scary thought.
Really? I'm looking forward to it!
That was delicious!
I was lying.
Huh?
Athena...
Yes, I was really surprised.
We're just like any other girls, after all.
To everyone I've met along the way...
...from the bottom of my heart...
Here you go.
Ah, no fair! I want one, too!
What a loud voice!
Yeah!
Ma'am, the truth is, I get to practice every day with a friend who has the best smile ever.
Please enjoy this other face of Neo-Venezia, which is typically known for its port-town scenery.
Hi!
So just hang tight for a little bit, okay?
You're really amazing, Alice.
I'm always worried I'm not singing loudly enough, or wondering if I'm singing off-key...
Yes...
And there's the man from the water elevator...
Your words brought back the feelings I had back then.
The Gondola Association, in recognition of your extraordinary talent, and with great hope...
From this day forth, you are a Prima Undine!
"Alice really is amazing, isn't she? I kind of admire her for it!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was in the guidebook.
Thank goodness.
I'm sorry, President Aria!
Right! We just happened to see you while you were working and decided to watch...
You've been watching me for that long?
Well, my thought was that you looked like a toy robot.
You're a Prima now.
Why don't we have a moon-gazing party tonight?
Moon-gazing...
You can't beat me!
The season when warm drinks taste great is finally here, isn't it?
I invited Al so you could catch up!
He might be lost somewhere, too.
Gazing up at the moon like this...
Honestly. No overworking allowed!
...it's that now, we have the still of the night all to ourselves.
It's fine, it's fine!
Huh?
Hey, President Maa! Go get Junior!
Just a little more!
or a lion, or a woman's profile, or rabbits pounding rice cakes...
Not allowed!
and it flies around in a geostationary orbit over Aqua.
...and revolves in a very close orbit, only 5,900 kilometers above Aqua's sky.
Yes.
The small moon that got too close...
It may seem like it's just the moon that's affected by Aqua...
What's ruined?
I'm so glad we found you, Aika.
If you're afraid of getting close and just flail around, it makes you hungry!
Yes.
I'd love to join you all next autumn!"
Two weeks ago, she was promoted to Prima even though she was a Pair, right?
Do you think her cheerfulness is just a front?
By any chance, did I give them wrong information during the tour?
Yes?!
Here's your limone.
Thank you!
Aren't you going to have one, Akira?
You were there, too?
I'm completely free that day, so I'm going shopping with Al.
"Queen Selfish."
Orange Princess!
Since I became a Prima, every day has been frantic.
This is the Bridge of Sighs.
Let's go see it later.
I'd be happy to.
Marco Polo was a famous Venetian merchant and author, and this is a replica of his home.
Next time we come to Aqua, we'll be sure to ride with you again, Alice.
Ah! I'm so hungry!
The usual three...
There you go again! You were worried about something like that? That's a bad habit, Junior.
I don't have anything...
I'm going to do my best to catch up to you, Junior.
What?!
Thanks. I knew you'd say that.
and Aika will be working there as the branch manager.
Your Prima Promotion Exam will take place tomorrow.
so even though it's the middle of the night, I'm going to go practice for a bit."
Thank you for keeping me company, President Aria.
It fell in?!
It seems like it might stop in the afternoon, doesn't it?
Akari...
We're going to win it next year!
Well then, let's continue on.
Alicia, isn't this canal...?
I can feel the deep, calm, melodic waves of the water.
...and firmly pushing me forward.
It was slow and gentle, as if the gondola became one with the water.
Now for the final course.
After all, it's up to you to decide what kind of Prima you want to be.
Say, Akari.
That is my goal.
Yes?
Yeah.
but for the future of the entire Water Guide Industry.
So?
I'm sure...
Huh? I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Akari.
I'm sorry.
It's buckwheat tea.
Oh!
How's it going? Are you done with the preparations?
Akatsukin, are you crying?
My, my.
I see.
...secretly, she's still the same crybaby.
Why yes, thank you.
Geez, she's such a thorn in my side.
...it's easy to tell that she's happy, and proud of Akira's achievements."
she attends various lectures, ceremonies, meetings, functions, all sorts of things.
This the first time just us three have gone to a hot spring together, right?
Come to think of it, you're right.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
You and Al were eating ice cream together the other day, weren't you?
He told me to keep him company while he waited, so we chatted for a bit.
Yay, me too!
That was a nice bath.
Aika, you just drank coffee milk after getting out of the bath.
Y-You think so?
Then, do you think she'd go for Akatsuki's brother? He's older than Akira.
Hmm, I wonder?
D-Do you think she's seeing someone?!
Huh?!
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Huh? About what?
"Because Al and Aika are in..." The part after that.
Huh? Natural tennen?
No really airheaded remarks allowed!
It's the first time this has happened since it opened!
That's right... why did she have to buy pork buns for lunch?
Sure are. My favorite rice ball shop was having a special sale.
Okay... here you go.
Wait a minute.
Um, that's because...
I don't even feel like getting angry anymore.
About these chocolate buns, this store that was famous for chocolate back on Manhome...
She just happened to be at the shop and answered the phone.
All right! We have an extra person now!
That means...
They're not costumes, they're uniforms!
It's a 3-on-3 mini-soccer charity tournament sponsored by Neo-Venezia's Tourism Association!
It's a 3-on-3 mini-soccer game.
All right, Akari! First, let's practice stopping and trapping the ball.
Okay, now it's your turn, Junior!
Receive the wonders! Receive them, receive them!
Gondola coming through!
Ah!
Gondola Coming Through Shoot!
It went in!
Picture Drama Episode 4 is...
Having an abundance of funds, and with manpower as their weapon,
That planet was...
There's no need to worry.
But of course.
Allow me to accompany you!
I'm sorry.
Aria The Origination.
...Alice's Ghost Story.
You mean we're early?
See? The waves begin to sound like chatter, and it almost makes you forget the time.
Yes.
It's no fun at all.
A few years ago, right on this coast...
Levelheaded people like Akira tend to be even more scared of things like ghost stories and mice, I think.
I wonder if Al is okay with ghost stories?
Of course he is!
Well then, a few years ago, three girls came to this coast on the night of a fireworks show.
Ah, thanks.
Huh?
Dan-da-dan dan-dan-da-dan!
Could you go on an errand for me, Akatsukin?
What did you say?!
...and ate one of the walnut breads.
But you couldn't have eaten it, so...
Picture Drama Episode 7 is...
Thank you for worrying about me and coming to visit.
Things aren't going as smoothly as when Alicia was here, but thanks to the locals recommending me,
If the mugwort rice cakes turn out well, why don't we take some to Alicia?
Well, I think it's fine to go see her.
There was a time when Alicia used to suddenly show up at my house, too.
...I was rather unyielding, even though she pleaded for me to stay.
Like a stain, that moment remained in my heart.
Ai!
I'm...
Coming!
...and the day started as it always does.
I don't know when that will be, but in order to face that day with a smile,
I have to practice hard today, too!"
It made me kind of happy that I appeared in your dream."
I'm sorry...
However, I got to see those fine sideburns instead, so I'll let this one slide for today.
Okay.
No sappy morning talk allowed.
I'll eventually have all of Himeya to worry about!
That's true. I'm really glad that Akira is my mentor.
I'm an Alicia fan now!
My, my. Thank you very much.
Good work.
But...
...you were no longer there.
Please stay!
Even after Akira and Athena became Primas and took on apprentices...
All right!
You're the heir to Himeya.
Yes, I know...
It does.
But despite that, the people of Venice rebuilt it every time.
we'll have to walk away from our gondolas someday, too.
My, my. Why?
Huh?
So this is what it looks like inside!
You're still growing, so you must be hungry after training, right?
but they get as much business as companies that are 100 years old.
Welcome to Orange Planet!
The new issue's out, huh?
Hm? Ahh, her!
She's said to be a genius at handling an oar.
I don't autograph things.
I feel sorry for them.
Sorry!
You work above the water, don't you?
Are you okay?
Huh?
I guess I wouldn't mind either way.
She says she doesn't like it, so please stop calling her that!
You're really nosy!
This does seem to be really important to you.
Yeah... Well, that is...
Using the water as best you can.
Good work, Sideburns.
We still have some time before the last ride down.
So how about some sightseeing up on Ukijima?
This is my first time to Ukijima.
Just say thanks and eat.
Unless they're really big feelings.
Bye!
there are wind messengers called Sylphs too!
Sure!
Please wait, President Aria!
Still, why would such a little girl be sending such an old letter?
Okay, I understand.
It's you!
You promise you'll deliver it?
I'm glad.
Ami, do we have a guest?
Is the heat getting to you?
Postman-san, how did it go?
Where is it?
Even if it doesn't exist, can you still tell me?
Yeah, I suppose so. That particular place was...
One of them had the same name that's written on the letter.
Yeah.
I'm gonna speed up a little.
q2But when you Undines guide people in your gondolas, your job is to create those precious feelings.
Somebody worked hard, because they believed they could make a dream come true!
It looks like the pioneer base has sunk into the ocean.
Alicia-san, what are you doing out here?
This base dug up more water than expected,
But why would that girl have a letter like that.
As you can see, I'm fine.
Wait... That place...
I wonder if we Undines could do it too.
There, see? That's the power of a Single!
Isn't it a beautiful sunset, Alice-chan?
Wait just a minute!
What a wonderful job!
No sappy lines allowed!
Where are you going, President Aria?
That girl must be the sender, right?
Let's ask the postman about it tomorrow.
Oh, there's a data card inside.
Although, as long as there are postmen like me in Neo-Venezia,
I'll look into it when I get back to the post office.
Maybe it's for her grandpa or grandma?
It's pretty narrow.
I never even knew this place existed...
I want it delivered so badly.
The postman's looking up the address for me right now.
You promise you'll deliver it?
Ami, do we have a guest?
Bye. Please deliver it.
Is it break time already? Welcome back.
Thank you.
Postman-san, how did it go?
A pioneer base?
Hey there! I have a delivery for Aria Company!
Well, is that everything then?
It's all right.
Just leave it to me!
Right!
It feels great, doesn't it?
Fish?
I'm gonna speed up a little.
Woody-san, what's that over there?
Are these... gravestones?
Then, where could the person from the address be?
Who could that be?
Alicia-san, what are you doing out here?
Accident like that happened all the time.
And the year he died is the same as the cancel stamp on the letter.
I'd rather go on a laid-back tour.
Why? When do we stop believing in them?
You still really seem to have a lot of faith in them, Akari-senpai.
Could that be it? Is that Neverland?
Aika-chan, you too! But why?
You guys got invitations too, huh?
I knew it!
And then much more where that came from!
Hey! Put your backs into it!
This... is... really... hard!
All right, then...
Behold, the willpower of a single of a Single!
Maybe it's about time we show them what the pros can do?
We're going to show you how it's done now.
The last exercise will be a competitive race!
Still, it feel kinda good, in a way...
All right then, it's lunch time!
I made us some boxed lunches.
Mmm! These sandwiches are great, Alicia!
It's the best!
Has anyone seen Alice?
Wait! Aika-chan!
I wonder if I lost it while I was swimming?
I lost one of my favourite ribbons.
Grilled rice balls are cancelled!
Can't sleep?
Maybe this island really is Neverland.
That might be true.
Akari-san, you used the word wonderful 34 times in your email today.
I want to meet Athena-san right now!
Go, team!
That's what makes his life pathetic.
Are you okay?
Hello.
Good for you.
i1She's smiling.
an8This is the KBC, the Kazamizawa Broadcasting System.
Akira, can we join you?
My belly is about to touch my back.
Oh, so this is where you were.
Who's that?
He's on the soccer team!
Didn't you see him when you were out practicing?
Isn't he cute?
The meet is coming up soon.
Don't worry about it at all.
Oh, hey there
Be careful about body odor, eavesdropping, and making unfunny jokes.
See you tomorrow!
Uh...
Tsubu!
Come in!
I'm hungry.
Welcome home!
Yep.
Does your mom know that you're here?
Sure.
Do you have plans to go anywhere?
Are you going anywhere over summer break?
Well, probably read some books.
It's Tsubu!
It's really hot in here.
I see.
Yuuto! Bring some barley tea!
Okay!
i1I was pretty sure that it ended on the day we went to see that movie, but apparently not.
I used to have a Djungarian hamster too.
Yeah?
Please take these vegetable scraps for Tsubu!
i1It's not like I've changed.
Here are the orders.
Tsubu!
That's dangerous! There's so much traffic around here!
I'm hungry.
All by yourself?
What!?
Yeah!
That's amazing.
Anywhere you're planning to go?
What about when you're not reading books?
I can't keep him! I'm too busy with work.
I promise that t-shirt is clean, but you don't have to wear it if you don't want to.
Let's see that shirt now.
It's all right. Where's Tsubu?
Thanks.
Careful not to slip!
I see froggies! Come back, froggies!
Huh? Oh, great.
I made you a list of things Tsubu-chan will need.
I figured.
Seriously?
You're too fast!
When I'm running, the only thing I hear is the sound of the wind, and it feels like I'm melting into the sky.
Oh?
Pure literature ones.
What?
Luckily, this is the biggest library in Yokohama.
i1Actually, it's more like...
I'm about to leave.
Oh, she's hanging out with someone.
Oh, I believe it.
but my dad says middle schoolers shouldn't take the train alone.
Akira, you're aiming for Kazamizawa High School, right?
Look at this one! It's so cute!
Please stand behind the yellow line.
You know Kirara-chan in class 4? When they did their seat change, she got put next to Naoto-kun!
Have fun at practice.
i1I should have time for one more.
Can't you slow down?
How can you keep running like that?
Excuse me!
i1He's wearing glasses...
Books aren't something to be recommended casually.
It's practically an ocean of books.
i1and more like an aquarium.
i1Let's not get carried away.
I got a photo book and Botchan by Soseki Natsume.
Is that the book you want?
i1Right, Chihiro?
Keep it up!
Tachibana!
But man, what a coincidence running into you like this!
Please enjoy.
...just like I said!
We'll bring you another right away.
Seriously, I can hardly stand to watch.
Is everything okay?
Finally done! Now for this!
You don't have to apologize so much. It's okay.
What a wreck. Fly wide open, shirt hanging out...
What the heck?
Is that all you're having for lunch, Akira?
Sorry, sorry! Excuse me.
What's up?
Well, among the ones working here...
This is harder than I thought.
Table six is waiting on their order.
Oh, I see you're looking to take a lot of hours again.
He has a flip phone.
Huh?
Was the book you borrowed interesting?
I'm sorry.
you always appear out of nowhere on a rainy day.
Youthfulness can sometimes be rough and vicious.
Am I not good enough?
Quite the oppositeI'm grateful.
i1This feeling...
i1It'd be too frivolous to call this feeling love.
Get home safely!
You mean like an app?
Sounds convenient.
Dude's a lost cause anyhow. He'd never get the hang of it.
how did you like the book you got? Was it interesting?
Just your average belles-lettres.
The friend who wrote the book's the amazing one.
I'm heading to work.
And as if it couldn't get any worse, Nishida-san's off today, too.
Oh, okay.
Did something happen at work?
Tachibana-san,
Youth can be like that. Reckless, sometimes even brutal.
Even though it's hard to imagine that now.
i1yet only they can grant shelter to.
i1I want to stand with you in this downpour, and be drenched in it together.
i1A prayer only I may offer.
This is what you get for going out in weather like that!
i1Divorced once.
Here's the order.
What? But you just said
Huh?
Yoshizawa, what's wrong?
Wh-Why don't I cut your hair for you, then?
I guess this'll do.
Oh, hi there.
You used to hang out with that girl with the almond eyes.
Ouch!
I'm all right.
It was because of an injury, huh?
I'm sure she wants to run.
but I want to play soccer as much as I can because I like it.
But it might not be something that easy for talented people.
Oh, are you doing your summer homework?
Oh, sorry.
Modern Japanese.
Oh, in that case, it's another story.
That person was an old woman who was pulling out the hair of the dead.
A courage to become a thief instead of starving to death.
The thing he thought of as something evil became a virtuous reason to live.
Is there a sequel to that?
I never thought about it.
would you have also become a thief like him?
What?
i1I wonder if it's okay to invite her.
Akira Tachibana.
That's right!
Hiya Akira-chan!
I'm in trouble. I think the boss's gonna fire me.
It doesn't matter how you start.
All that excitement made me hungry. Time for lunch!
Oh, well, I...
Anyway, bye.
I guess it's only natural for an athlete who's been injured to drift away from their team, huh?
It's for a make-up class.
You mean Akutagawa's Rashomon!?
Yeah...
His attention was drawn to a large pimple irritating his right cheek."
could they perhaps be good, if done to stay alive?
Where does the story go from there?
What?
Sorry. Hard to think about, huh?
I'm so glad!
Have a good night.
OP
Seriously, he's such a smooth talker.
That'll be 200 yen.
This brings back memories.
Akira.
Hey!
How come you guys are crying?
Because...
Sorry, Akira! I gotta go!
Thank you.
Why did you choose this place?
Oh, and...
Yeah, this is what I wanted!
You look good, as usual.
What?
That wasn't me.
This brings back so many memories!
I haven't actually finished writing one in four or five years.
It's not like I have plans to show it to someone either.
Come on, drink!
Excuse me!
That place is a true friend to college students.
Kondou, I'll drop you off halfway.
Then I'll walk too.
Are you all right?
That was horrible!
You're going to walk, right?
D-Don't underestimate the manager of a diner!
Huh?
The world better be ready for me!
Akira!
Really?
Do you need some help?
And...
i1The team?
i1Oh yeah.
also had a friend in the same club who I was close to when I was a student.
i1Even if I feel anxious...
Step right up!
I need the potty too.
Excuse me?
Red, huh?
Then I'll try for red too!
A-Akira, I just want to say...
Wait, seriously!?
"You never say hi"?
Enjoy!
but some of my fans do happen to be young girls.
You actually went out and bought it!?
He and I disagreed so much over these movie reviews that we used to come to blows!
I scribble a thing or two... from time to time...
Nah, I kinda want to walk it off.
Yes, I am!
Are you okay?
Man, that was horrible!
See you around!
C'mon! Next bar! Next bar!
Look out, world!
And so a new semester begins!
What's gotten into Kiyan?
Appreciate it.
I had an argument with my friend.
Oh?
Oh, um, okay.
I thought it was because we're both grown up now,
even if you and your friend had a falling out,
I think he's my type of guy.
One ice cream and one chocolate parfait.
I'll cook it up with love!
Please stop.
Hey, I have a good idea.
Soft and chewy cheese bread.
I'll go check on the customers.
Huh? But what about the rest of the things that make your heart flutter?
253 yen is your change.
Well, once he realizes, he'll come back for it.
We'll keep it for him.
i1If he gets held up at the next traffic light...
By the way, what is Tachibana like?
Well, that was amazing!
Crap! Don't fall!
an8I broke the dishes!
That's it?!
I'm promoted to manager?
Um, Manager.
All right.
What?
I'll go back later to pick them up.
No worries at all.
Thanks.
i1Call me if you need anything.
Part B
My mom is at work.
I'll come again.
i1It's not his fault anyway.
No, it's just a pedicure.
When it's your hand, it's called a manicure.
Oh, I see.
Does that mean...
Can somebody take our order?
an8The train will remain at this station momentarily while an express passes by.
New order.
Your change comes to 253 yen.
Well, I'm sure he'll come back for it.
Huh? You and Tachibana-chan go to the same high school?
What is she like, anyway?
Actually, all I know about her is that she's really fast.
Oh, this? Forget about it.
Yoshizawa? Why?
Oh no, not at all.
I'm bored.
Oh! Tachibana-san!
I'll just try again some other day.
I'm the one who decided to run after him,
Oh no, not at all! But I really feel like I should at least meet with your mother
Are your nails also red because of the injury!?
I was just thinking you give off a much
It felt like I'd seen this scene before.
Thank you for waiting. Your sweet rice dumpling parfait with brown sugar sauce.
Huh?
I know.
I didn't know you were going to have a stall here!
I won't let it go out of business.
Oh?
Wow, sounds like you're still a romantic.
I think he'll be back soon.
Come on, old man. Please make it cheaper.
What?
It's to thank you, and also to apologize for today.
Okay.
So Akira isn't going to undergo rehab and return to the track and field team after all?
The writer, Kujou Chihiro.
i1And I hurt the people around me.
because it gave up trying,
Forever and ever.
Oh, here. Thanks for this.
would likely even forget about looking up at the sky.
i1any place where you won't get wet from the rain...
i1Thanks.
What are you up to?
l-like I said in my text,
Well, what do you know! Never thought I'd see you with a stall out here!
Oh, Pops here runs a used book store I used to frequent in college.
My buddy who runs an antique store asked me to sell 'em.
You see, Hugo and his publisher were so close and had such a deep mutual understanding
So then, Pops, can you cut me a deal on this one?
What? Not a chance.
Here, I'll throw in one of those antique postcards for free instead. Deal?
Eh?
I'd like this one.
No, none to speak of.
Yes.
That's a pretty tough question.
i1I used to be the same.
Looks like it's seen a lot of use.
See?
We did?
What!?
Seeing as this is a restaurant I can't say she was wrong, but it sure was sad.
Manager,
Eh? You do?
I want to hear more, and eventually I'd like to read what you write, too.
My writing?
Whatever novel you write, I'm sure I'll love it.
We're giving the track to the soccer team soon, so let's all run it one more time.
Sundays too?
I have to go back.
Haruka.
I completely forgot.
Oh, I need to get going.
Well, let me know if you want to order anything else.
Hey, it's me.
I heard your novel is going to be made into a movie! Congratulations!
I didn't know you were coming, so I don't have anything.
I couldn't do it either.
Does siphon coffee drip in one minute to begin with?
I was excited every day even though there was no guarantee.
It wasn't like there was something beyond that point,
I can't write anything anymore.
But your work is helping a lot of people.
Gross.
You don't even know where the finish line is.
But I wanted to stay true to my dream and my writing aspirations.
i1if I keep holding on to this feeling,
i1does it mean I can find my way there one day?
Rain's gonna start any minute.
i1Seems like it's gonna rain.
Honestly. Why not leave a little earlier instead of dragging his feet?
Sure!
Whoa, holy smokes! A movie adaptation?
Don't surprise me like that. Quit showing up out of the blue like that.
I live to surprise you!
I know, right?
My old one broke, so I bought this. All it took was one click online.
Good, it's really going now.
Of course I am. Ain't that right, Tsubu-Tsubu?
Haven't got any. But I will get some cups.
What would grow from the seed that he carried?
I wanted to see you because you knew me back before I'd taken a single step.
That to do so would be a betrayal of your past ambitions.
What's really getting in your way is you. 
I wanted to imbue my writing, even just one line of it, with a deadly poison.
Do I?
OP
Keys: check.
Academically speaking.
Yep, I am.
Huh?
I'm just gonna go to college for now and figure out what I want to do later.
And they'll assign a new manager to this place.
That'd never happen.
but let's take out the hurdles.
It's so cold!
Let's see the wind here together.
What?
Yep!
A promise you made to yourself but have forgotten?
Akira?
Seriously?
He's actually going to be promoted.
I've been taking strict lectures at the head office almost every day recently,
Take a look. This.
Tachi
i1Every time I see the sky after the rain.
Oh, uh,
Wow!
Wow!
And the one who made me realize that was
It's okay to trip. You just have to get back up and keep going.
So I promised Daddy that even if I fall behind, I'll make it to the goal,
but I wanna be number one!
It will help your feet move faster too.
I appreciate it. He was so thrilled he couldn't talk about anything else the whole drive home.
But I'm having a blast writing it.
do you also have a promise to yourself that hasn't been fulfilled yet, Tachibana-san?
What!? Oh, I'm sorry! My sincerest apologies
Yes, understood... I'll make a point of it...
wherever I am,
We can use the field now, so take out the hurdles.
Kaza High!
Kaza High!
That'll be for me.
I'm very sorry.
Oh, he's coming this way.
Uh, well, you have to be careful not to overcook the stone-roasted bibimbap.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm done!
My apologies!
Hey, Yuuto! It's echoing through the restaurant!
You can't practice it here!
Oh, Dad. I can play it now.
I'm going back in.
My apologies!
I'm sorry.
My belly is about to touch my back.
Yamamoto!
Well, for example,
You're kidding, right?
Hey, Akira!
No problem.
The meet is coming up soon.
It'd be easier with you on the team, Akira.
an8Hey, you guys!
As for me, it saves me a lot of trouble, so I'm really grateful.
Do you happen to have one of those social media apps on your phone...
OP
Yoshizawa is funny.
A black cat with white paws.
Soft and chewy cheese bread.
i1Something that makes my heart flutter...
Thank you very much.
No!
You should calm down a little.
Lie down on that bed.
Manager.
What?
Let's take a look at your injury then.
Thanks.
Whose number is this?
i1Yoshizawa told me about it.
i1A black cat with white paws.
i1I'm sorry that I didn't realize it earlier.
Maybe I'll go to the convenience store.
There's no need for that!
i1It's not his fault anyway.
Are you sure?
You mean a manicure?
That's totally the wrong thing to say.
Um, is there something wrong?
i1That's a nice setup they have.
What?
i1said...
I like you, Manager.
OP
Her leg injury is recovering, though.
You're right.
Well, I feel like I might not perform that well.
I'm sorry.
Huh?
Yep.
Please, join us.
Don't come.
You might even be able to compete with the guys.
Just five shots.
I just have it taped up because it feels a little weird.
I like you.
i1Tachibana's coming back to work today.
i1Was that a dream?
Hilarious!
an8They tasted really good.
i1What did I do to deserve this?!
Oh, right, the soft red bean jelly.
I don't even like karaoke.
Tachibana, I'm 45.
It doesn't matter what other people think.
But...
We won't get wet here.
I like you, Manager.
i1The smell of wet leaves.
A 45-year-old without any hopes or dreams.
Huh?
What? Uh, well, I just meant...
Huh?
Yes. It won't happen again.
Yeah.
Oh, English, huh?
I'd like a sandwich, please.
I haven't seen a high school textbook in ages.
Hello! How many?
Certainly, sir. Please take any table you like.
Please don't tell anyone.
Huh?
You went back home once to get changed?
Yes.
Will you be okay?
It's empty because it's a weekday.
Hurry up and...
You're going home already?
Aren't you hungry?
I got depressed about it at that time, but I feel fine now.
But isn't it creepy that he's a 45-year-old man?
Wait.
Yes.
That can't be true!
Hey, Angelica! It's me! You remember me, right?!
Certainly.
Certainly, sir.
Oh, do you come here often, Tachibana?
Well, occasionally.
Hello.
Speaking of which, that movie we just watched...
What, seriously?
Wherever you want to go, Shun.
Is that so?
Sorry, Tachib
Sorry.
I don't know.
I'm really worried.
Come over here.
Sorry about the mess, but please make yourself at home.
Yep!
Did you come here on your own?
Nope!
Yep!
It looks good.
I wanna do radio calisthenics!
Really?
It's really hot in here.
What?
so there's no way I can have pets.
Sorry, but you're gonna have to keep it at your mom's place, okay?
Okay!
I'm...
I'm sorry.
It didn't seem like it was going to rain at all today.
Let's just hope it stops soon.
Thanks.
I don't remember having an umbrella like that.
What?
A frog!
A frog!
Oh, hi there.
Thanks.
I used to have a hamster too, so let me know if you have any questions.
Oh, I might still have some toys at my place.
What is it?
You, um...
Considering all that, you've been speaking to him a lot today.
i1I wonder why I feel so strongly about those things these days.
Oh, never mind.
That'll be all.
Okay.
i1Apparently, he likes a certain kind of literature.
You two have a fight?
Also, don't talk to your older sister like that.
Thanks for waiting!
Sure.
Shinsugita.
Akira, you want to go to Kazamizawa High School, right?
Yeah.
Seriously?
When you have Mukihiko, you can become closer to the person you like.
Kirara likes Naoto?!
Akira.
Why do you always run ahead without waiting for me?
When I'm running, the only thing I hear is the sound of the wind, and it feels like I'm melting into the sky.
Wait...
i1He's wearing glasses.
You like pure literature too?!
If that person happens to not like that book, it becomes a chore for them to keep on reading it.
They have everything here.
Do you want to borrow that book?
Okay.
i1The manager seemed a bit down that day.
Really?
But you read a lot.
There are millions of people who read books.
You don't want to lose something that's fun for you again.
I'm not the kind of adult you think I am.
Huh?
i1Right now, I'm the only one who can protect that.
Okay.
ED
Hello.
i1We're friends.
Part A
Well, uh...
Hey.
Akira, you're friends with Yoshizawa, right?
Oh, sorry. That's a weird question.
But I've always wanted a chance with him.
I'm sure you will.
you'll gradually find more connections with him.
And if you have many chances to get to know each other,
I think that friendship can turn into a romantic relationship.
I heard that's something that happens to people a lot.
Can you keep this a secret?
I'm going to get back to work.
Thanks.
i1Summer...
i1Summer is...
What?
You like sunflowers and curry?
I'm letting off some steam.
What?
But it might not be something that easy for talented people.
It's homework for my remedial class.
Which part do you not understand?
What's the question?
This is a bad question.
I don't think this is a good question because you can have different answers depending on that individual person.
Oh, sorry.
In the previous version, it says the servant ran out into the rain toward the town to commit a robbery.
but I think when he was writing that sentence,
If you were that servant,
Manager!
Yes!
Let's go.
Fish!
Okay, okay.
I'll go for the red one too.
Pathetic, isn't it?
He's so old!
I'm supposed to meet a friend here.
Chihiro.
This was our favorite place.
an8Oh, I've already ordered something to nibble on.
Well, your book was rather interesting.
I borrowed it from the library.
Like I said, it wasn't too bad.
Right?
I can't believe you still have this.
We just talk on the phone sometimes about our son.
No, not anymore.
You're lying. Your face says that you still do.
I haven't talked to anyone about this in a long time.
Yes, sir!
I've had a bit too much to drink.
Kondou, I'll drop you off halfway.
That's why I told you to take a cab.
The moon, huh?
The station isn't far from here.
i1That rush of excitement we used to share.
i1Those miso tofu balls from the other day were so good.
No, I can do it.
Did something happen?
I might not be able to patch things up with her.
Oh, okay.
i1Oh, isn't tonight...
Hello.
My wishes...
but things kind of got awkward between us, and we grew apart.
for the first time in ten years.
Huh?
Looking at the moon?
Yeah, kind of.
Part A
I'm sorry for asking you out on such short notice.
Oh, I didn't know you had a daughter this big.
Of course.
In other words, because Hugo and the publisher had such a close relationship,
I'm sure that even within this short letter,
there were many thoughts only the two of them understood.
What? Did I sound like a romantic just now?
He can't hear anything when he's like that.
I've been doing this job for a long time, but there are few people who are as much of a bookworm as he is.
I'm sure it happens to everyone.
No way.
How about if I give you an old postcard for free?
So Akira isn't going to undergo rehab and return to the track and field team after all?
I've lived my life alongside novels.
Well, I hope I can keep on writing things that make you feel that way.
Thanks for the food.
i1It used to be like that for me too.
The other day?
I should return it to the store, right?
There was one bird that had trouble flying.
My words?
That's the same injury that Tachibana has, right?
Poor soccer team.
It's my shift request for next month.
Okay, okay.
Tachibana.
Hey, Akira.
Huh?
Part B
I heard your novel is going to be made into a movie! Congratulations!
I brought something good today.
I buy everything online.
Let's see.
What kind of seed did they bring?
Does siphon coffee drip in one minute to begin with?
I don't know. It's just an approximation.
That novel is shit.
Otherwise, your younger self would be disappointed in you.
That room isn't about your regrets; it's about your obsession.
Someone left this behind.
Hi.
Keys: check.
Huh?
It's normal...
It made me feel like the time has finally come.
Nishida.
Huh?
What made you decide you wanted to become a hairdresser?
Yep.
What?
What?
Seriously?!
Yep!
I wonder how I can get faster at running.
Teach me.
That's it.
Like this?
I did.
He usually quits everything halfway through.
I haven't been able to write smoothly at all, though.
But I'm really enjoying it.
I suffered from that promise, and I learned from it too.
The one promise I made myself was to spend my life together with literature.
Oh, Tachibana.
Well...
See you later.
Thanks!
Finally.
I have to retake the test.
No, it wasn't.
It's the eyes.
Don't cry!
Tachibana?
Here.
Go, team!
i1No matter where I am.
Thanks!
Snacks really hit the spot when you're feeling depressed.
I'm refreshed like these chocolate sticks.
Actually, never mind.
She's right.
I'm sorry.
Ishii! Great job!
You are?
Just five shots.
Okay.
Get set!
Anyway, you should come inside.
i1He went on half-listening to the rain
Tachibana?
i1It seems to be the same as usual.
I like you.
i1Th-That was a close call.
Manager.
i1What did I do to deserve this?!
i1Even though I'm a 45-year-old man, I feel like crying.
an8I like you.
I'd like to know your answer.
I'm old enough to be your father.
I like you, Manager!
Huh?
I like you, Manager.
i1a 17-year-old girl saying that she likes me.
i1I don't remember the last time that happened either.
It's not even lunch time yet.
So? What's up?
Tachibana-senpai!
Well, it turns out I'll be competing in the next track meet!
Akira?
Really?
What?
It's really pouring.
I love you.
i1Aimlessly he had been listening to the pattering of the rain on the Suzaku Avenue.
i1How should I act when I see her?
i1Yeah. As if she'd ever fall for an old guy like me.
Manager...
i1Maybe it's about time for a smoke.
and thank you for the sweat bean jelly.
i1What did I do to deserve this?
an8Were they tasty?
Manager, I love you.
How do you feel about me?
I have a bit of a fever, and...
Not to me.
i1the scent of greenery, wet with rain...
i1a sweaty shirt collar, clinging to my neck...
Just try going on a date with me.
Situated on a thoroughfare as important as Suzaku Avenue,
an8Hello.
Thank you for your call.
I saw it on the new shift roster.
Oh, yeah, I do have that day off.
Is it someone in high school?
Oh, English, huh?
Right.
i1A junior in high school.
i1She's calm for her age and is impassive most of the time.
It's on the house.
You don't want me to?
Thanks.
Huh?
Didn't you have school today?
Yes.
You can squeeze my hand if you get scared.
Let's at least go have tea.
I'm sorry if I've offended you.
You call this a date?
Do you want to answer it?
i1I'll think of something then.
Part B
Oh, I have a different hair style than usual.
Okay.
Hurry up and...
My god, Angelica!
Well, that was a great movie.
Oh, do you come here often, Tachibana?
Oh.
Um...
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
i1Above all, I just don't want to get hurt.
Um...
They're both the same.
You'd go on a date with me!?
Since the Rashomon stands on Suzaku Avenue, a few other people at least,
Cool.
I saw the new shift schedule, and...
Go where?
I've already got one at the moment, but...
Yeah. Uh-huh. Tutoring? What's it pay?
Why'd you even call me if it wasn't a girl!?
Man, what a drag.
Whoa! Seriously?
Hey Kase-san, wait 'til you hear this! Ootsuka-san spent
i1Quite a portrait.
Studying for something?
Yoshizawa-kun never shuts up about how fast you were.
You call this a date?
Hey!
Let's see...
O-Oh... I guess I'd better think of something, then!
It's never gonna work out between you two.
I'm just saying there are better options you could be pursuing.
This looks like it was quite a movie.
i1No, she's bound to show up while I'm gone if I do.
It was so amazing I could watch it over and over!
Boy, my eyes just aren't what they used to be.
What, me? Uh, 45...
that receipt...
Hello? Oh, hi.
Then I'll see you at work next time.
Which one is from today!?
No! They're different!
RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES JOINT JOB INTERVIEW

This concludes our interview.

Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
So please, drink up.

That's not funny.

How am I supposed to get 5 million yen right now?
I'll let you hear their voices one last time.
There's no way this is a scam!
I'll go by car.
do you have any better ideas, Dad?
That's enough.
Bring that knife and come this way.
It'll only take a minute. I'll explain later.
Aegis.
Grandpa, do you mean...?
Relax.
Which room?
Out of the way.
Let's carry the chair too. It'll be faster.
-Hold that part over there. -Got it.
I'm on the ground?
It's what your leader decided!
If you get serious about it,
-Catch them! -Yes, sir!
Stop, you guys! Over here!
are you going to leave your father and brother and run away?
is the same one from before?
Accepting momentary despair Good night
NEXT MOMENT
one eerie man stood firmly.
That old man can control it, right?
There's no reason not to use his power.
It's always better to have more strength.
I got it. Then let's do that.
Great! This is it!
THE TENTH MOMENT
I want you to evacuate him to somewhere safe.
But...
Don't say anything. I know.
If it's possible to control the Herald from far away, then as long as you're somewhere open,
Anyway, I'm going to protect Makoto! That's what I'm going to use the Handler for!
Hey. Makoto, you want to stay with Grandpa, right?
giving him time to replenish his energy would be a fatal mistake.
So this is what unconscious control feels like.
He moved!
If all they're going to do is appear close by, then I have the advantage.
I thought I told you not to go alone!
Hey!
-Dad! -Takafumi!
I'll let you live just a little longer.
Catch him!
Makoto! Crush him!
-I'll go! -What?! Hey!
His body got bigger?
Wait! Don't go alone!
-Grab him. -Yeah!
Consume...
He turned into something scary!
That's not recovery.
and remain here alone?
-The reason this happened in the first place-- -I'll let you out.
I teach people how to use their consciousness.
it's possible to enter and leave Stasis by controlling the Specters.
You've almost reached that point.
It's up to you to decide whether you believe me or not.
Sometimes, faith is what's needed to make things turn out well.
"Faith" is what makes it possible to even sever yourself from
Anyway, today,
Every religion has a pillar,
Liar. You know you're not supposed to use chemicals.
Fatigue and emptiness Meaningless morals and hesitation
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
I'm also cutting ties with this religious organization.
You'd better make sure you've calmed down by tomorrow,
Junji.
Juri, I'm begging you. Come back.
Are you hurt, Juri?
Dad, what were you doing messing around like that?
Seriously? He just charged straight in and stabbed him.
-Get something to tie it off with! -Hold onto this!
You're right.
I think that the Heralds are composed
But drawing in the particles requires energy too.
Well, just sitting here watching him isn't doing any good.
She's not mad?
He'll be okay. This will be his good-luck charm.
I feel sorry that Miyano ended up like this.
-I'm going to go back to keep an eye on Sagawa. -I'm going too.
Dive! Mole attack!
No matter what you say, I'm going to stay here.
No. It's dangerous here.
Family problems?
I'm thinking about having you guys leave too.
Come over here and look.
There's nothing there.
He's extended them this far?
There's something I want to try.
So what?
You're gone
then
Lift your face.
Hey. When do you think
I should send him back to the other world?
Makoto was about that age too.
We have to explain everything to Mom and my sister.
Dont try to push me suddenly from behind, like you did before.
but if I practice hard...
Tomorrow...
Im starting to understand you.
Hm? What? Do you like it?
Flo-wer.
Say Hello, Sanae.
That's right. Its almost been half a year already.
Hey, you.
itd get stuck in your throat. Thatd be dangerous.
No depressing thoughts.
Weird.
Why?
Because... after all... I want to go back...
This was the first time I was pulled in.
Oh. I calmed down your Specters, so youll be okay now.
Who are you?
I see.
In 1880.
Ive had a Specter in my body from birth.
I often brought him to Stasis.
To me, its just like breathing.
I dont have my phone or any money.
-Please be careful not to miss this train. -My feet hurt...
He said youd definitely come home tonight, so we should stay up and wait.
Hurry up you two! Hurry!
Education Department! NIce to meet you!
Crazy now crazy now
Don't stop no turning back Flashback
My sister, Sanae, had Makoto without knowing who the father is.
Are you telling me to support the family with my mother while I'm still only 22?
Go, Tsubasa.
Juri. What's...
gotten into you?
Outside Line Call komadori Preschool
You don't know him?
-Based on Makoto's reaction, -Tsubasa, why are you
Who is this guy? Is he really his guardian?
I'm only going to say this once, so listen up.
Building B, Room 102.
Hey, say something.
Stop, Juri.
That's enough.
Bring that knife and come this way.
What about air friction and force?
You know that's too much for me!
That's how people in this world end up.
I'm sure they would at least lock it.
The ones who called?
Hey, you!
Damn! Old man!
What are you doing?
Stop, you guys! Over here!
I would've wanted you to fill me with your voice
Autumn passes right by
Several Months Ago
And others ridiculed for being old-fashioned.
the power of Stasis described in the Great Circle Scriptures will be ours.
Crazy now crazy now
Crazy
Look up realizing it's all past
If you don't, I'll stab this kid!
You can't boss me around like your disciples.
It's disappearing...
That huge monster...
I told you. It's The Handler.
What do you mean? what do you mean Tsubasa and Makoto will be okay?
That's why it appeared when they tried to hurt Makoto while he was stalled.
I don't know what exactly triggers them to appear.
and then they would attack us.
There's no way that could happen.
Hey, that's right! Grandpa, that thing!
-That thing? -That thing just now, instant teleportation!
Wouldn't it have also been better to show the others?
The grandpa's instant-teleportation power Is a bigger problem.
No way...
Yeah. Stay back. It's better if you didn't see this.
Shibata, let's capture the father.
Yeah. Chasing after the old man was a mistake.
I see.
The teachings were true.
that we now know that The Great Circle Scriptures isn't just a fictional tale.
Redo the spell.
and immediately use the spell again,
That's right, Grandpa! do that thing you did before!
Sorry. I can't.
I'll save Takafumi.
Well, at least the disciples believe
It's been 17 years...
It looks the same...
It's not here!?
Makoto...
Painful happiness comes over me
Goodbye
Juri's life is under threat.
Crazy now crazy now
It wasnt me.
Hey! Whats wrong?
Merging with Specters allows us to enter Stasis and move around freely.
Hey! You!
What have you been doing up until now?
were supposed to be known only by the Genuine Sagawa family,
What? Imoto?
Effort
Shell turn you into one of The Stalled!
You idiot! Do you think we have time for that?!
As long as youre sure that you can leave Stasis with your own will,
you can continue to use the nature of the Specters, which are the natural spirits of Stasis.
In other words, the Heralds uptime is limited.
Where are we?
Kidnapping?
Right? Are those scary guys gone now?
Kids adapt to new things so easily.
What am I supposed to do...
Hey, come back!
You havent been out of the house in a while. you should take it easy.
What do you mean that the second daughter has the power to expel Specters?
About your home situation, your economic situation, and your lifestyle.
I have something to talk to you about, yukawa Takafumi.
Huh? Shh!
Hey. Thats the girl we saw in the documents, right?
I have to go home and check to be sure
Now Im getting a double bonus!
What are you doing?
After them!
What, seriously?!
Surround them! Well get them for sure!
Anyways, we have The Stone.
You're gone
Autumn passes right by
Next Moment
Grandpa!
Don't stop no turning back Flashback
Look up realizing it's all past
Too fast I feel torn, ah, ah...
Hey... Grandpa...
Grandpa, go back by yourself.
That was the first time Ive ever felt that Stasis was like hell.
I thought it was dangerous to teach you the spell.
Yes. Ive thought about it so many times that Ive lost count.
Are you okay? Breathe! Breathe!
-I think I'll pass. -Then Ill go first.
Smaller tits!
Could it be...?
Anyway, we have to get Dad out of their building.
Im talking about Stasis.
Personal benefit?
Manpower. An information network.
They would take The Stone and run far away.
Wed be exposing ourselves to those two, when they could be anywhere!
What do you mean? I was strangling her. Like normal.
It wont move anymore.
The Herald marks the intruder
Dont hurt The Stalled.
the power of Stasis described in The Great Circle Scriptures will be ours.
There is no need for more words of teaching now.
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Don't stop No turning back Flashback
From before...
Makoto and Tsubasa will be protected by that since they can't move.
I don't know what exactly triggers them to appear.
That's not possible.
Like you said, the existence of The Herald is our biggest obstacle.
Then it won't protect Dad?
Yeah. Stay back. It's better if you didn't see this.
Hey, stand up.
But what would happen to Dad in that case?
If that happens, then we'd end up leaving Takafumi in this world.
You just try to fly there.
-Fly? -Fly.
So, what are we going to do?
So, what are we going to do? What's your plan?
Since we can use fire, you brought a gun, right?
Ma-tan?
Then we entered this world...
Then we were suddenly attacked. And then...
Don't cause a scene, you bitch!
We're supposed to make it look like the Yukawa family disappeared.
I wandered into Stasis with my family.
We were caught up in the Yukawa familys stasis spell.
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Crazy now crazy now
Crazy now crazy now
Look up realizing it's all past
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Ah ah...
Flashback
Stop it. Dont say such creepy things.
You did step on them! you slammed them real hard!
Nao!
This feels so good.
Yosuke... Wait!
Even Sagawa doesnt know how people turn into Heralds.
If you're in a situation where youre unable to leave Stasis,
You idiot! You come over here!
Im sure it wont be easy.
This is all Dads fault for hiding something so convenient like the Stasis spell.
Those arent people who can be reasoned with!
It just looked like a mummified body.
Sako-san.
I plan to capture the Grandpa when he shows up.
Lets try it.
-Let me know immediately. -Sure.
without crossing the permitted boundaries, the Heralds wont do anything.
Increasing intent to kill little by little is hard.
Uh... thats... huh?
Your intent to kill must have been too weak!
then we would have seen Heralds of this size many times already...
Do they really exist just to protect The Stalled?
-You were just hired by Sagawa, right? -Thats not what I mean.
-Do you have any idea the resolve we've-- -Stop! Both of you!
Uh, Ill tell you later.
Staying with you helps me hold on to my sanity better than following those crazy guys.
Fatigue and emptiness meaningless morals and hesitation
But she had no time to relax. something strange started to happen to Tsubasa...
The Sixth Moment
Ma-tan. time to change.
Coming in coming out
It's full of noise you can't see me but you hear me loud
Flashback
Ma-tan...
So, what are we going to do next?
Dont tell me you dont have a plan!
Dad!
Youve gone soft.
if Grandpa and I left you just now and disappeared?
What?
Dont tell me, What? come on.
It really is him! hes moving.
-Dont touch-- -Tsu...Tsubasa!
Lets go to the Yukawa residence.
and this is how you end up?
I cant believe it.
But I cant forgive you for what you did.
Are you relieved?
Keep your promise.
My intent to kill has to be clear all at once!
Itll be fine. trust me.
No way!
That would be faster anyway!
I just wanted to have a feel for it.
-You idiot! What are you doing? -Go! Grandpa!
-Hurry up and run away! -You can do it!
Expel it from the big one too!
Dont you want your grandson anymore?
You're gone
Next Moment
He's warm...
Ah ah...
Well, when we leave Stasis,
That's good news.
-So, first off-- -Hold on.
What?
What? "Only"?
But, do you think you could beat those guys on your own?
He's also one of the hires, but his standing is a bit different from ours.
He's rather dangerous.
Right in front of our eyes.
It must have been when Anan died and the Specter came out.
I agree.
I'm not interested in a future like that either.
If you help me, I will leave you in charge of The Genuine Love Society.
If it were up to me, I would seal away the Stasis spell.
How was it?
As long as there's a chance of the Yukawa family returning, let's keep a lookout here.
-He betrayed us. -What?
Grandpa, I'm thirsty!
-Give me back my money! -Grandpa, you're so funny!
of The Genuine Love Society!
I want to hide him somewhere safe.
If no one else became Heralds after my family,
Is everyone here?
Even if it does involve some risks!
I bet those guys are planning to dispose of the Stone without telling me.
Guns don't kill people, people kill people!
Hey. We can ignore Sagawa's instructions now, right?
Was someone here?
and the experiments and studies he conducted Inside Stasis.
We requested radiometric dating for The Great Circle Scriptures once.
The Founder lived for 500 years, and wrote the Scriptures.
By "I want to watch the world for a long time,"
I found The Master Stone!
If you're not interested In making the world a better place,
What is it like to be completely controlled by a Specter?
I hope I can give you a good demonstration.
Goodbye
Accepting momentary despair good night
This is my last sermon.
Its a little earlier than I had planned,
but I hope Ill be able to give you a good demonstration.
Look around you
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
a movement that I performed of my own will.
What is the main characteristic of a Herald, Yamai?
Huh?
Its
I dont mind if you run away.
The first is whether or not there are any Heralds here in Stasis now.
you harbor towards The Stalled.
I got it!
We'll get behind him,
I cant do any more than this!
W-wait, wait. hey.
Ill go and create a situation that makes it easier for you to save your brother.
I think its not impossible.
Hm? Im sure I could crush it with my teeth If I wanted to,
Then do you need some soy sauce?
or gathering the Specters to the center of your body.
So you admit it.
I see.
Ill bring Sagawa-san right now.
Normally, it would be wrong to do this, but right now, its okay.
Ah! Dont run, Makoto...
Of course no one would listen to me.
No. I can still sense her close by.
Dont make a scene.
Listen. Theres an old saying,
-You should teleport up! -Huh?
The Specters decipher our wills and suppress those physical phenomena.
Then we dont need to engage in a staring contest that goes nowhere.
What if--?!
Whats the point in taking something like that?
Is there a reason the spell wont work without placing your hands on The Stone?
If everything is just like I imagine... No...
If you could get what you wanted just by wishing
Accepting momentary despair good night
Juri resists in vain.
A single miscalculation determines our fate.
I don't want to die.
I want to go home.
Look around you
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Crazy
Look up realizing it's all past
Look up realizing it's all past
Hey, you.
If we lose you, then the rest of us will fall like dominoes.
In order to protect your family.
Let's start in the direction that sagawa and the others walked off towards.
Aegis!
Grandpa!
Even if we found it,
we wouldn't have enough time.
If I lose Grandpa...
Everything's back.
If we have her use her power to expel the specters from our bodies, we can leave. But...
Call me "Princess" from now on.
Sorry that it's come to this.
That's why he attacked me without any delay.
I see.
He's pretty high-powered, isn't he? Damn!
There's a risk
That's right. from the past to the future.
What do you mean?
What kind of social systems?
Sagawa's goal is to witness these truths until the very end.
if we told him we'd forgive him for what happened today,
If we were sure we'd win, then I wouldn't have a problem.
-But-- -And Sagawa wants to fight.
Then we have no choice.
Hey.
But I...
I'm not going to give up!
Stay back! Stop!
What just happened?
Yeah. Hey, Grandpa bought me a toy--
Well, then, how should I do this?
Memories of you I hide them deep in my dreams
What do you think about using that thing to fight Sagawa?
If it joins the battle, we'd have the advantage.
But...
This is a great chance to get more influence!
You know?
Look around you
Don't stop no turning back Flashback
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
It came back quickly this time.
No, hold on.
If it's possible to control the Herald from far away, then as long as you're somewhere open,
And that's how I'm going to fight!
If we give Sagawa more time,
I didn't see it myself, but Sagawa could turn into a Herald
They're watching me.
He moved a little, but then he stopped.
Which way?
The person in charge here right now Is definitely me!
Hey, Grandpa.
and who's controlling that thing, Is you, Makoto.
Don't worry, Makoto. your future is bright!
Neither of us can run away or hide.
Are they bluffing?
Those clothes...
This movement Isn't of his own will.
-Grandpa! This is our chance! -Yeah!
Makoto?
What is that?
Sagawa's body should be past its limit now.
That guy's stomach. It's being eaten.
Juri!
I'm okay.
His body is weak!
I'll let you out
If you hone your senses, you'll feel your blood tickle.
that was based on an old folk religion.
An invisible pillar that supports people and that supports morality.
Good morning.
There are new ones in the annex. let's go get them.
-Junji? -Shh!
You're gone
I would've wanted you to fill me with your voice
Is his story a revelation for the future? or is it a path to despair?
In the end,
Five years later, my father died of an illness.
Look around you
Crazy now crazy now
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
That's the only reason the Genuine Love Society exists.
Go home with your family.
If you choose to say goodbye,
you'll lose the chance to experience each other's pain forever.
Juri, I'm begging you. Come back.
What--?!
No matter what it costs.
Neither of us can compromise an inch.
It looks like I said too much.
He stabbed a fallen enemy without any hesitation.
has been concentrated into those thin threads?
Give this to the doctors!
Everyone! don't touch the threads that Sagawa laid down!
What a nice, peaceful face.
How much time has passed?
He might be sucking in airborne particles.
If that's the case,
It's nothing.
If he does anything weird, I'm going to take you with me and teleport.
This is going to turn into a test of endurance.
My family's problems are none of your business.
Afterwards, the two of us
Whoa!
Hey. I told you to put away your shovel.
We just noticed too!
-I wasn't paying attention then. Right now, I'm-- -Look out! Stop!
I've finally got him.
He'll suffocate to death eventually.
Give it to me.
Autumn passes right by
and The Stone that Juri needs to return, no longer exist.
Do you think I got germs in it?
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
The date.
Well. Its nice going on trips sometimes.
Im glad you said youd stay here with me.
But...
We have to explain everything to Mom and my sister.
-Protect everyone. -Stop.
Okay.
I might figure out how to use my consciousness, just like Sagawa said,
Great...
Sorry.
It makes me sad to think Im going to live like a thief forever.
Its a flower.
She decided shes living for Makoto.
I need a change of pace.
Whats wrong?
No depressing thoughts.
No depressing thoughts. no depressing thoughts.
Im not the one whos crazy. It's this world!
My body is being pulled.
He got older little by little.
Come and play again when you feel like it.
I told you. I used to take my husband here often.
headed towards Tokorozawa.
Everyone must be asleep.
No way...
-Grandpa? -Hm?
Ever-changing memory is therapy
Huh?
Don't stop No turning back Flashback
Ah ah...
Hey!
Mr. Kato!
Being ejected from Stasis by force seems to involve a lot of pain.
Its no good
Dont worry. Hes not participating in the spell.
Hes one of The Stalled now.
Oh well, it doesnt matter.
The fact that its getting smaller means that its using up energy,
I cant let the same thing happen to Makoto!
Right? Are those scary guys gone now?
The phone call for the ransom wasnt that long ago.
The guys that kidnapped us couldnt move either
Whats going on?
Hey! Hey!
I guess so.
But according to Majima, the Specter was expelled from the guys body
About your home situation, your economic situation, and your lifestyle.
Were about to make a deal between the heads of two households.
What are you up to?
That was good! This is the best!
Like this!
Hey. Thats the girl we saw in the documents, right?
We'll finally be considered as the MVPs!
What happened to your neck?
Sorry.
I could have spared you from doing something so dangerous
I dont know why, but no one's moving.
Be careful! They have a weird power!
Ever-changing memory is therapy
Memories of you I hide them deep in my dreams
Too fast I feel torn, ah, ah...
Ah, ah...
Look up Realizing it's all past
Andre isnt breathing.
Wait.
Juri!
I thought that if I taught you the spell, you might use it recklessly...
Thats how I felt.
Take a deep breath!
That busty bitch cant jump alone!
Oh, my God. They piss me off.
Come closer, I dare you! You guys are gonna...!
The reason they kidnapped Makoto was to make us use the spell.
Our enemy is a mysterious new religious sect...
Yeah.
The Handler is protecting them, so the enemy wont be able to hurt them.
You can never be too careful.
The way the restraints were taken off...
We have to make sure Juri and Grandpa are okay.
-You must have been pretty surprised, right? -What?
Thats how we've viewed you guys.
Uh... no...
But if that were true... wed be living a better lifestyle...
Im not sure.
Were waiting for orders from Sagawa.
Im going to see a doctor! My nose hurts!
Oh, I see.
We could live out the rest of our lives with a healthy diet--
But you started complaining about the blood and stuff.
-Knock it off. Shut up. -You were just standing around watching.
Hey. Its dangerous...
Did he get eaten by this thing?!
and became an inhabitant of Stasis.
Like were germs... and this thing is a macrophage?
And you were the first person to run up to this monster just now.
You're gone
Autumn passes right by
Her eyes were filled with the light of despair. What could it possibly mean?
THE FIFTH MOMENT
Ive seen it once before.
We were caught up in the Yukawa familys Stasis spell.
What are these things?!
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Crazy now Crazy now
Ah ah...
Don't stop No turning back Flashback
Oh, but...
But she was mentally weak.
I want to test whether shes able to expel the Specters
Hm? Yeah.
-After...After everything is over. -Right.
I can see how certain types of people are attracted to that kind of guy.
and prevented Sanae from becoming a single mom.
You said you wanted to make her listen to you, right?
Theyre gone.
Oh, sure. Just one.
Im going to propose a settlement with the Yukawa family through Mr. Takafumi.
Then we should just capture the rest of the family and take them as hostages.
and string them up as an example to get them to surrender.
All right, hand me your knife.
Huh?!
Its all right. You don't have to force yourself.
-We dont lose anything, right? -Seriously? Do you really believe that?
If the three of us run away, theyd chase after us and try to kill us for sure.
Hold on, Ma-tan, get down.
Maybe this really is a dream...
Green summer has come to an end
Goodbye
Accepting momentary despair Good night
Crazy now Crazy now
Flashback
Makoto...
I might have been a hostage, but at least I was acting as an undercover spy.
Come on!
Do you have any idea what would have happened
Wood?
His body hasnt changed...
He was definitely here before.
Oh! Juri!
Aim for the moment it appears.
Youre so stupid, Auntie Juri.
Of course.
No...
That would be faster!
Was it that old man who summoned them?
Hey, old man!
Old man!
Im getting down!
You're gone
I didn't even know your name There was no need for words
If you could get what you wanted just by wishing
I saw on the side of your face What looked to be love
How is this journey that felt like an eternity going to end?
THE SEVENTH MOMENT
Crazy now Crazy now
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
There's no way it's okay.
WHITE SESAME TANTANMEN NOODLES SORA SORA
Not bad at all.
I'm going to join you guys.
He's also one of the hires, but his standing is a bit different from ours.
The members of Majima's family, and the eldest son,
You can do whatever you want with it.
I don't have much knowledge about the religious field.
That's the kind of person I'm looking for.
How was it?
As long as there's a chance of the Yukawa family returning, let's keep a lookout here.
Did something happen?
-Give me back my money! -Grandpa, you're so funny!
-He's in the annex at the Yukawa family's house. -Did anything unusual happen?
Whoa, there!
My hand went numb!
Give that to me.
The lock hasn't worked since time stopped.
But you want to seal away the Stasis spell?
I don't believe it.
The Great Circle Scriptures, were all written by a single person.
They all said they were written by the same person.
They pretend to speak about ideology,
and the experiments and studies he conducted inside Stasis.
Experiments?
The Founder lived for 500 years, and wrote the Scriptures.
Most likely, The Founder...
We can't trust him. Just like Sagawa, just a little different.
I've asked Mr. Shiomi to look after my body
It is the power that supports the world.
Green summer has come to an end
Shake Shake Shaken Empty
I saw on the side of your face What looked to be love
Complete control by a Herald.
Look up Realizing it's all past
Look up Realizing it's all past
to leave yourself behind and become a Herald.
In other words, this reflex is my own.
Huh?
This power comes from the muscle fibers the Specters created using my arm as a base.
This is a good opportunity to measure how fast Im able to move.
-You monster! -Sagawa!
How am I supposed to know? Dont ask me.
Well, lets try it out.
Go ahead.
I envy you.
Aim again carefully!
That Grandpas power is a problem.
This isnt his real intention.
I still have a sense of taste.
And here I thought you were going to use me to check for Heralds again.
Did Stasis make Sagawa evolve?
Did this man change Stasis?
-Why do you ask? -I heard about you from Mr. Sagawa.
So you admit it.
I decided to follow the proposal of Mr. Sagawa, my client.
to convince Juri and Dad
is influence!
Of course.
while I stayed back where its safe.
But I know I can do it!
Are you sure it was a good idea to send her alone?
It was her own idea.
If you have 10 times the manpower, then surround them.
you need 10 times the strength.
It was on TV two days ago. The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
were moving at an extraordinary speed.
-How is it? -I think its enough.
Hes played his role as bait.
-somewhere safe. -Hold on!
Exactly.
Whats the point in taking something like that?
The Stone is gone!
What if... Does that mean theyre planning to use Grandpas blood?
What?
Is there a reason the spell wont work without placing your hands on The Stone?
You're gone
Not thinking much Seeing where the city will take me
If you could get what you wanted just by wishing
This can't be happening.
Don't that make you crazy now Don't that make you crazy now
Crazy now Crazy now
Crazy
Don't stop No turning back Flashback
Look up Realizing it's all past
Ah ah...
Flashback
Stand back.
Technically, that's not true for all of us.
Everything's back.
I'm switching over to your side. Take me with you!
This isn't too bad.
We can leave Stasis.
But we won't know unless we try.
Call me "Princess" from now on.
He's pretty high-powered, isn't he? Damn!
we're able to exist in a world where the flow of time has stopped, in Stasis.
Do you mean...?
They're able to stop time
If there is, then what about the next universe?
It has nothing to do with us!
Then we have no choice.
But I...
I could do anything. I could do the same thing that Robin Hood did.
He's dead?
This...
Oh, Juri!
Enough about that!
It's just you guys seem to do this impossible shit regularly--
Painful happiness comes over me
You're gone
Don't be doubtful again I've been patient I wonder if you'll give me your heart one day
It wasn't a dream?
I'll help myself.
No, it's fine.
Are you heading out, Himeko?
That's cold.
At Yamaboshi Academy,
For example,
take Nagase Iori, who figured that choosing one club out of so many would be too hard,
so she let her homeroom teacher pick for her.
Huh? You're the only one here, Inaba?
Taichi, do you have a topic for the next edition of the StuCS paper?
Zip it.
Y-You want me to pick?
3:55 PM.
Huh?
Did you take that down, Inaban?
Well, we figured it would be a good idea to talk to someone else.
I guess...
You see, last night...
Next thing I knew, I was myself again.
Aoki! Don't make me part of your creepy fantasies!
So we had the same nightmare
More or less.
Don't cut me off in the middle of a thought!
Th-These are...
See? Taichi says, I mean...
That's because you guys are putting on such a weird act.
I'm positive that Taichi and Iori-chan have switched places.
Which means you should know information only Taichi would know, right?
Got it.
Big jugs, huh?
I'll find out if this is really Iori.
Are you okay?
This is how I always look.
Oh, are you on your way home?
And you're Taichi, right?
Did three people switch bodies this time?
Yes!
It's sort of exciting, almost like we're a secret society.
Some Fascinating Humans
Oh, I'm gonna keep on eating
Man, I always choke on the first bite
Right, thank you very much.
Is that the same answer Aoki and Kiriyama will give Ms. Hirata?
You're excused.
Oh, I need to go to the restroom.
Enjoy.
Then I have no choice!
restroom.
Huh? Oh.
Sorry about that.
No, nothing's wrong.
Uh, well...
And what's so special about Fujishima?
Iori is a C cup.
Oh, could you stop calling me Mr. Go or Goto?
Heartseed?
I just happen to
And are you able to control this phenomenon?
Yeah...
Good luck then.
I'll be cheering for you a little from
Dammit! This makes no sense!
Got it.
urge to go while in Taichi or Aoki's body, that means...
Yeah, thanks.
Nothing to worry about.
Honestly?
That's true.
It's not safe to leave a girl alone at night.
I never mentioned this,
but I moved away because you're Aoki right now.
Each one of us implicitly has a soul, mind, and personality
the result is identified as Nagase Iori.
because of the personality switching,
I... I'll also volunteer.
Over here!
Taichi!
No sign of him anywhere.
Go!
Club!
I bought takoyaki!
Huh?
Uh, I can just ask them to let go.
Anyway, this girl looks just like Nagase-san.
Er, wait...
Just hurry!
Huh? S-Sure...
Okay, let's try this again.
Tell us your name and age.
Kiriyama Yui! Eleven years old!
an8Thank you.
Maybe...
But I kept remembering stuff
It was almost blindingly clear...
So clear, it's a little uncomfortable.
If this phenomenon only occurs during that time,
We can go there tomorrow.
Wh-What do you mean?
I am Heartseed.
Sorry, Inaban. See you tomorrow.
Mihashi Chinatsu-san.
That's amazing.
I used to.
Sorry, Himeko-chan.
Himeko-chan, what do you want to drink?
Yaegashi Taichi-san.
Oh, you sure look like her.
Technically, I was Inaban,
but it was me on the inside,
Was I supposed to hear that?
What's a kiss?
Huh?
So the words on the board were meant as a hint.
Huh?
But she moved away at the end of the school year.
Are my feelings gone?
Tell me, Taichi...
Sis? What's wrong?
Taichi, can I ask you for a favor?
Can you watch me closely when I'm a kid, just for a bit?
But this phenomenon is bringing our
I forgot to live carefree.
Kako Random
And we'll need hot water.
There, there.
Why are you here?
Start by explaining the baby.
Don't tell me that you had a baby with him?
Into a Snowy City
What happened to the cool you?!
Anyway, she left after we promised to explain later.
We can play games with Nana!
Oh, er...
I'm sorry.
What's wrong, Yui?!
Kiriyama was also fourteen.
I was...
Are you sure you can make it home by yourself?
But you promised...
I remind you of your ex!
Wait! Hold on a moment!
to become an empty shell.
I decided that I would never interfere
You always act like you understand
Back then?
That way, I'll be happy with my life no matter when I die.
Let's hurry.
Why are you in such a hurry?!
There's still plenty of time before noon!
And now, I love Kiriyama Yui.
Is that so wrong?
Nana is Nana. You're you.
I could have explained that I was scared of men, and worked something out!
I used to hate losing,
It even has the character for my name in it.
A-Anyway, I'm...
How come he recognizes her?
Huh?
I thought it was odd that you were the only one
Mom!
I'm...
Kako Random
But you just told us.
It was a mistake to choose you.
I'm starting to remember a bunch of
But now, we can't even step outside,
so I'll have to make up for it later.
Sorry about waking you up.
So that's how I looked.
Aoki and Yui really impressed me back there.
Yeah, he had told Mom that he wanted to get back together.
Calm down, Nagase!
Because I love Mom.
I remember now.
Wait, Nagase!
I won't do anything that hurts the rest of you.
Wait up, you idiot!
Mom!
Shut up! I'll open the door, so pipe down!
Okay, this phenomenon has ended now.
and Number Two are acting separately?
so she can start her life over?
I need you to stop talking.
I wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for
No.
Huh?
Haven't you ever discussed this before?
No, because I just wanted Mom to be happy.
Mom, I can't be happy if you're not happy!
Should we call the police?!
What are you
That was a surprise.
Yeah, he was on his knees outside the door.
And just like that, winter vacation was over,
and our lives were back to normal.
I have faith.
but do I truly love Yaegashi Taichi?
You're about to slip out of the cycle of reincarnation.
But you don't remember what happened there, right?
Come on, come on.
Three days ago, Makoto Kobayashi tried to commit suicide by overdosing on pills.
He's come back...
Makoto!
What's wrong? Do you want to see your face?
Ugh...
This is my father.
Mine was.
Come in, come in.
I'm grateful that you did all this for me.
What is it?
It won the gold medal in a contest.
...basics of the basics that you'll need to complete your duties.
I bet you're just saying that...
As for his mother, recently...
Are you sure you're an angel and not...?
She was going into a love hotel in Futagotamagawa...
...with a middle-aged man.
Only to see another familiar figure emerge from the hotel.
...teacher from her flamenco class.
You're my guide, aren't you? Don't you have any advice for me?
...Puripuri or Poroporo!
You hardly ate at lunchtime either...
Dispose of them.
Hey, the heck was that for!?
Huh? Me...?
It's nice that you're starting to feel like going outside...
It's not my brain!
I thought he died.
Good to hear it.
A horse that can fly would be awesome too, but...
Ah!
Huh? She's from the Art Club too?
It seems you've aroused suspicion, my lord.
Makoto, Mr. Sawada was really surprised with you today.
U...um... It had been a while since you went to school...
That you seemed to have gotten much stronger.
Me too.
You're a third year now.
My grades had nothing to do with it.
What's it to you?
Or...surely not a n...n...near death experience?
...they might start ignoring her too.
Nice justification.
And to meet Hiroka, from time to time.
Shouko's nagging got on my nerves, but...
I put ketchup through it. I figured Makkun...
Mm...well if that's what you think...
Anyway, it's natural to feel lost at times during your training.
It's like Purapura said.
Huh?
Uh...n...nothing...
Later.
Then I'll go. I've got a good feeling about this next one.
...between her father and...another man...
Then...are you going to come to the hotel with me?
I see...
What're you doing? You could've bought an umbrella at a store...
I don't have it...
Hmm...
You've been sleeping for nearly half a day. Since you got back from the emergency ward.
Oh...it's you...
Can I come in?
...l...like Hiroka, don't you?
Some people said they saw you together in Nikotama...
Well...umm...there are lots of b...bad rumours about her, but...
And you took on all the sadness in the world.
I don't want to be in that house.
Heck you made some big ones in your past life.
Do you know about this?
So jealous...
I gave up when the rain started.
Not yet. I'm pretty dumb, so...
This is where the first Nakakouchi Station was.
Nope.
Woah...
Wow...
...I kinda want to ride the Kinuta Line.
Huh? Really?
Wanna go together sometime?
Why don't you try them on?
Awesome... Can't believe they were 40 off.
Hey, want one? A thank you for today.
Really?
You're a man of simple tastes, huh? Getting all fired up over a meat bun.
Laugh all you want.
Huh? The colour looks fine to me.
Hey...
Can you draw me next?
But in the end...
...but I had no idea she had been seeing a doctor about it.
When you took those pills, it was...
I haven't told them yet.
Ahaha...
It's not just me who's sometimes cruel for no reason...?
...and then about once a week I'll feel like running off and joining a convent.
Huh? Oh... Don't misunderstand, your brother's not giving up.
He suddenly decided that it'd be better...
...so he'd be sure of passing.
It says sometimes they invite famous artists for special classes too.
I promised...
We bought shoes together...
You talk to him too, don't you?
I've gotten stronger because of you.
I'll finish that picture.
You're late.
Ah, wait!
If you're lucky, you have a good long life ahead of you.
Purapura!
Onii-chan!
Did you burn yourself?
Right?
Huh? S-Sure. Su-Sure?i take stutters phonetically because it keeps things consistent
Or, for example,
Or, for example,
The title is "A History of Professional Wrestling Through Variants of the Brainbuster."
These days, it's common for a brainbuster to involve slamming from the back,w
q3but originally, it was a move where you slammed them from the head
I only asked if you had an idea.
As blunt as ever.
Like hell I will!
That's not the problem here!
In other words, a miracle!
What led you to that conclusion? overlap
Why don't we have some tea for now?
A-Are these...
It's my first time touching them, but...
a girl's... a woman's...
Yes, let's talk...
but then she realized, "Wait, it's actually Iori-chan!" and stopped herself.
Inaba, you might not believe it, but please try.
Wait, why does it feel like I lost something important?
Wait! Inaban, are you serious?!
I'll accept it.
the latter is far greater.
Onee, are you okay?
It's okay! I already ate.
Why do I have to be in this totally uncute body?
Man, the first bite of hot food always goes down the wrong way.
which is why I let you guys call me Gossan,
but talking down to me is kind of...
Some mini chocolate buns we shared yesterday had gone bad, so we all came in late with upset stomachs.
That's all.
Would they say the same thing?
Well, if you say so. I got no problems with it.
So?
Iori's trying to keep her sane.
Hello?!
I was just trying to find a place to hide!
A-Are you okay, Nagase?
What's your class's president like?
I just got here.
This person is healthier than he needs to be.
q0If you want a name, "Balloon Vine" is something like one for me.
And I will observe you while this happens.
Wait!
Hey!
This is just ridiculous.
q0If you run into someone, act like the person you switched with.
It's a habit.
Um... can I make a suggestion?
It's a big deal if you ask me.
Yeah, you're right.
I was thinking that it might be dangerous to leave a girl at home alone.
Wait... Nagase?
You mean that thing with Kiriyama?
Or are you worried about something else?
Is it anything I can help you with?
W-Welcome back.
Though, I'm probably overthinking it.
What do you mean, "the wind is blowing"?
Anyone willing to do it?
I...
I'm in love with Nagase?
Selfless freak.
I set you up as an obstacle for Fujishima.
What?
you're in love with Iori, right?
And Fujishima's a girl!
Shut up, you hopeless wrestling fanatic.
She's the weakest link in the CRC.
And that weakness is exactly what you want.
I've never thought anything like that.
She needs someone to set her identity.
No, I went a bit too far.
Will you forgive me?
Where'd it go?
Will you go out with me?
I got it.
Inaba-chan is always so direct and manly!
It's impossible to move in this body!
Listen up. If you do it again, you're dead.
Yeah, but she said that she had something to do, then left.
So...
All I can do is lighten the shock.
That's what's so amazing about you!
Well, it's not like I'm thinking anything big.
He apologized like crazy.
Hey, Kiriyama.
I don't really want to tell you.
I want to help you.
Then let me help you!
I'll show you that you can't lose to any man.
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.From preview
Come on, hurry up!I want to hold hands with Yui
Kiriyama, I think this is far enough.
I'm a girl! Why do I have to feel a man's pain?!
But it worked, right?
You even hurt your own body.
Is "I wanted to" good enough for you?
I might be wrong, after all.
Go get 'em, Kiriyama.
I guess good things can come from this personality switching too.
Inaba?!
Inaba, what's wrong?
Hey, Inaba?!
I thought you were going to die!
You're blowing this out of proportion.
How you even got that idea is beyond me,
Yeah.
Wh-What?
Too presumptuous.
The fact that you don't need to joke is more important
than your joke about not having a joke to begin with!
I even changed my tastes to match his.
I think this was back in first grade.
the only thing I know for sure about myself is that I can tell exactly what someone else wants.
Why'd you say it again?
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm guessing it's Taichi in my body.
Like I could leave you here looking like that.
If there's a reason, tell me.
I want to help you!
Don't say "I just want to" or "we're friends."
Isn't saying it that way kind of unfair?
What are you worried about?
Am I your enemy?
but it's not like you couldn't steal a few coins every time.
That might be true, but...
I'm the only one worrying about things like this.
I don't trust anyone in this world.
q0You always see people with personalities they don't like because something tragic happened to them.
You think I could do something so risky?!
you still have me.
that something seems a lot worse than it actually is.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
I see.
Need a tissue?
Taichi, how do you feel about Iori?
I love you, Kiriyama Yui-san.
And you can always change y
You know, I've always been curious.
There's plenty of good things about you too.
But it's mostly just a feeling.
I hate you as a friend.
Is that all you wanted?
I have friends waiting for me.
When I switched with Yui yesterday, I saw a text from Aoki.
See you.
It felt like they were in a different world.
Don't tell me you really can't figure it out!
How do you feel about Iori?
Well...
Oh, just you two?
Nagase-san ran out the main gate.
i1Nagase!
But were you really just pretending?
Not thinking some things through, yet completely overthinking other things.
Yeah. Starting somewhere in the middle.
I love you. Nagase Iori, will you go out with me?
Well, I'll apologize ahead of time.
Wait... What are you...
He'll be here soon.
Are you saying you can control people's lives?
For the next 30 minutes, I'll make it so that
Basically,
Yeah. He could've been lying,
I'm being a selfless freak for myself!
You want to help, but you can only hurt yourself. You're such an idiot. Seriously.
I didn't want to say it,
I, Aoki Yoshifumi, want to switch with Nagase Iori.
I see.
Can I... have a word with each of you before I go?
What did I do wrong?
I love you too, Taichi.
Maybe we...
Who will it be?
Oh, it's time.
There shouldn't be any permanent damage.
It's my way of apologizing.
We've been had...
How much of this was planned?
I think we can do a lot more than you think we can.
Have a seat, Iori-chan.
But with her injuries and the next issue on our minds,
What's wrong, Inaba?YEAAAAAHHH
You're taking your stress out on me, right?
Wait! It's not what it looks like!
Inaba?
What's gotten into you?
Hey, Yui, you're bleeding!
I don't know why, but before I knew it, I called you.
You wanted to talk to me, right?
We haven't had a chance to talk
Your girlfriend?
Well, it might be better if you thought that, but...
Yester
You called?
Let's see.
Hey. What do you think you're doing?
And then Aoki-kun came out of the crowd saying,
It turned into quite the struggle.
Wait, did you hear one, too?
Will you cut this shit out?!
I'm very sorry from around the middle of my heart.
Why not leave us alone if you really feel sorry?
q3Simply put, I'm unleashing the desires you hold in your hearts.
We weren't worried about you in the first place.
Kiriyama's absent again?
Your super-ego would usually stop you from doing something so stupid. But now...
q3Your desires get unleashed, and you just can't help yourself.
Oh? When I wasn't here?
I see two possible ways of dealing with this.
Helping each other out isn't a bad idea.
We'll deal with the situations case-by-case.
And Aoki can take care of Yui
Wait, Inaban, aren't you coming?
I can't work if you're here!
What should I do?
The way they are?
Sorry. I wasn't thinking about that at all.
I think you can see your true self in how you live your life.
I have to do it right.
No! No! No! Don't look!
Her hair's pretty! She's tiny! She's pure!Fades out
I set the scene for you.
Huh?
I'm telling you to bag Iori before Fujishima beats you to it.
Facing adversity to save someone fits you perfectly, doesn't it?
Shut the hell up, wrestling fanboy.
I should probably mention that Iori's in love with you.
Well, it's your problem to work out.
Do whatever you want.
I have a feeling that Iori's in the most danger.
could break any one of us eventually,
Are you an idiot?!
No, I was too harsh.
You're absolutely right. It's okay.
We'll never finish at this rate.
But I can't continue to lie to myself.
Let's take a few more shots before the girls
P-Please stop, Inaba-chan!
a normal life!
Yui-san, are you scared of us?
I kept telling you how I loved you,
Yui!
so I can't blame you for not noticing.
But she's got it pretty bad.
We're talking about the girl I love.
It's scary because I can see you pulling it off.
but don't let it concern you.
I realized that you and Aoki would
Nothing happened though.
I'd rather not say.
Y-You're kinda scaring me.
Grab me.
Yaegashi-kun...
No, it really wasn't anything special.
You need to take care of your own body.
You know, the one in your club.
I'll be sure to lend you a hand! Later!
Hm?
I think it was...
What?
...my mom managed to calm her down and send her off to school.
I texted her, but I need to get her ice cream or
forcing you to act on your desire to sleep a little more.
So Yui was absent again today?
She's childish, but in a good way...
Snap out of it, Taichi!
Iori! Tackle him from the front!
It doesn't look like our desires get unleashed for very long.
He just wants to make waves between us.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Just so you know, I'm here, too!
It doesn't have a camera.
Yeah. The whole CRC.
Are you feeling well?
If not, we can go home now.
I suddenly had a craving to eat a lot of sweet stuff yesterday.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Quit playing the victim.
Do you know what kind of problems you could be causing us by taking the easy way out?!
I'm going straight home today.
Is that why you didn't do anything when Nagase yelled?
So I'm not going to the club room either.
I never thought you'd turn your back on a friend.
Okay!
I definitely want you to spend time with us.
It feels so... empty.
For the time being, we should focus on Kiriyama.
Aoki, calm down!
Who's "playing" hero?
Taichi, stop being so full of yourself!
Aoki, stop being jealous!
Onii-chan, is something wrong?
Good night.
What the heck is wrong with me?
Oh, Inaban!
Kiriyama from Class 1-1.
I'm talking about...
Do you dare deprive yourself of such an opportunity?
Six groups here, too, Fujishima Nee-san!
If you already have someone in mind, feel free to form your entire group now.
Let's be in the same group, Yaegashi.
so you're helping me out this time.
Just get away from me already!
What's the big idea?
You don't have a right to tell me what to do.
I didn't know she was defending our love, too!
Okay?
Two of them!
You're feeling down, aren't you?
Was it Nagase?
Or maybe, Kiriyama?
Oh, don't ask me for advice!
Oh, damn! I sound like a real teacher, don't I?
Could you listen to what Yaegashi has to say?
Huh?!
I was just telling Yaegashi about the importance of talking to your friends.
Conversely, there are probably a lot of things that won't go well if you don't decide.
Leave it to me.
Me?
Everyone is worried about us.
but there's more to this world than just the five of us.
If you're okay with it, can I stay by your side?
and hurting you, too.
can I stay by your side?
I tried so hard to keep us together.
Well, I did give it a lot of thought.
I agree with you. You're selfish.
This is a different kind of "hurt," though.
You want to save Yui, right?
Just us wanting her to come out isn't enough.
She needs to want to come out, too.
But we don't know when this whole thing will end.
If we're really careful and don't back down...
That's like something our grandparents would say...
I think I got it.
I'm so sorry.
It's open.
And not to brag, but I've got a dirty mind.
You won't be in any danger.
Hurting you is the last thing I'd want to do.
q3And just for good measure, you should wear something erotic.
So let's hear this baseless claim.
Why not put some more faith in yourself?
q3It was just supposed to be what we needed for the week,
You're not here to tell me it's over, are you?
Don't you remember, Inaba-san?
So what do you want?
You didn't come here for small talk.
What the hell are you?
Yo.
Inaba!
Her desires got unleashed!
Don't care. Handle it yourself.
Could you stop fooling around?
Hey, Inaba, help me!
Were you born this way or what?
Oh, looks like you've made up.
It's good!
Yeah.
Oh, shut up. I brought my own.
Wait, Nagase...
Inaban!
Inaban!
You kept trying to get me and Taichi together.
I'll always be your friend.
I'd just get in the way of you and Taichi.
Why can't you go back?
How can you lie to yourself like that?!
q3but now you love Taichi so much that you just can't take it anymore.
No matter how bad it got, she'd never give up.
Arrogant to the end, with no respect for anyone,
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.
Yaegashi-san fell.
I mean, you're not going out with Iori yet.
You did it to me once before.
Dammit!
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, yeah. That's what happened.
but nothing's changed between us since then.
What's going on?
And I get a compliment, Inaba-san?
They're back to they way they were as kids.
You think it's Balloon Vine again?
That's the only possibility I can see.
What?
Sorry. I have stuff I need to do, too.
Well, we came close to being in a situation like that,
But not.
If you do...
How are you related to Balloon Vine?!
He's not that kind of person.
q3It's weird enough that we'd talk about something like this,
Seriously.
Oh, my mom's back home.
Some... stuff happened.
What, your boyfriend?
I went up against Mihashi-san in a lot of tournaments.
Yeah.
Nagase.
Now that he's got Inaba? What?
N-Nothing, Kiriyama!
I still can't really believe it...
Sorry about that, Himeko-chan.
Dang!
What were you talking about?!
Crap! They need to change clothes, now!
For now, turn around and close your eyes!
Balloon Vine'll probably show himself and explain all this soon enough, but it's taking him way too long.
Something like that.
Do you think she'd look like me if she were in high school?
What is it?
Aoki Yoshifumi, eleven!
They're so warm!
Is this how Nagase was back when she would change her personality to what people around her wanted?
How long are you going to keep grinning like an idiot,
By the way, what was I like when I was a kid?
q3A pure young maiden can't produce breast milk, you idiots!
op
What are you doing here?
Well...
You had a baby with that guy?
I got Anzu to go home.
q3We get together in the club room and talk or play around...
Quit it!
Was everything you said a lie?
Wait, are you serious?
Oh, right!
She said she got a fun new game
I'm sorry.
Why do I keep thinking that she's Nana's sister?!
But is that because Yui looks just like Nana?
M-Men...
You're distracting me.
Sorry to make you all worry about me.
Shut up!
Before she moved away, Mihashi-san came up to me after a tournament.
If you never gave them a real response, would their feelings change?
If the person who kept confessing just stopped,
what should the other person do?
But now...
We're counting on you if anything happens.
But that's why I decided to enjoy life to the fullest.
It should be around here.
I see.
I need to tell her now! There isn't a moment to lose!
I really loved Nana.
because I was living life to the fullest.
I could've just explained myself, and that'd be the end of it!
I don't know, either!
But I was making excuses! I gave up on everything!
In the end, I couldn't even take the first step!
Thanks to you, I want to be strong again.
See?
Listen, I might not be able to right now,
Of course you're Kiriyama-san.
You do kinda look like Nana, though.
How does he know who she is now?
If school starts while this is happening...
But you just told us...
Did they mention what they'd do if you told us?
I said that you'd regret it if you told them.
I said that I'd make it forever. Remember?
My clothes!
Clothes! My clothes!
Now we can't even go outside, let alone go home.
I-I mean, I don't really want to trouble our families over this...
But my mom and sister are really mad at me right now.
No, I'm fine.
I'll bear with it.
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
You can't help but think, "If only I did that,"
I don't think I'll ever be able to be like them.
But aren't there some things you can do together with others that can't be done alone?
Not good.
H-Hold on, where are you going?
Home.
Because I love Mom.
I remember now.
Iori!
Though, on second thought, it really is something personal...
I've always thought
Why are you showing yourself now?!
But there's something I need to do first.
Huh?
The one you call "The Second" has their own ideas.
What?
I'm talking about your current situation.
I can't do anything about it now?
I've always wanted to be my true self.
So, I...
Could I ask you to keep quiet?
I don't want to do that.
Come on, Iori.
See?
Huh?
No.
I'll be fine.
I've put up with you for long enough!O.O
Who says I have to let you in?!
He promised he'd never come back.
Yeah. And he was crying on his hands and knees by the end.
Yeah.
Sure, he might've been pretty bad,
but I am who I am now because he was there.
And that's a fact.
The next time we fight, it'll be at nationals!
And so, our winter break ended,
He's a great guy, but...
It's morning!
I slept well.
Wow, scary.
What, you two come to school together?
It's almost October, but it's still so hot!
Right?
Or, for example,
Inaba Himeko, who intended to join the PC Club, but soon had a falling out with its president,
But you asked.
Just Taichi and Inaban?
Yeah. Kiriyama and Aoki aren't here yet.
Iori.
Though, the price is pretty fair.
q3No one's looking for that sort of excitement from our newspaper.
Actually, last night, we...
That's not the problem here!
That had to be a bad dream!
It's just a bunch of coincidences happening all at once!
What led you to that conclusion? overlap
Will you two just quit it?!
Guess this is Iori-chan's way of being considerate.
Or is it just coincidence?
Why don't we have some tea for now?
Oh. Sure.
In many ways.
and was going to punish him physically for it as usual,
But I've never seen Inaba so happy before.
Yui, Aoki, what do you think?
Wouldn't you agree, Yui?
I guess I have to accept it.
I will. I mean, with Iori and Taichi like this...
Excuse me, Inaba-san,
Wait! Inaban, are you serious?!
But I guess that's how we grow up...
I'll accept it.
I wonder.
Is it really only a one-day thing?
Onii-chan, stop treating me like such a kid!
Why is your name some obscure plant's?
not him, after all.
I can't take this anymore!
I think that's the least of your worries.
We can't say.
So what were you guys doing?
You can go now.
Yeah. I don't know how she can lie through her teeth with such confidence.
No other choice!
Hello? Taichi?
I'm in the...
N-Nothing important.
What's your class's president like?
Get that look off your face! It pisses me off!
q2The problem right now is Fujishima-san! What am I supposed to do?!
q0If you want a name, "Balloon Vine" is something like one for me.
Yes. Very good, Nagase-san.
Though, I won't watch you 247 for the sake of privacy.
That was hardly an explanation.
I still have plenty of questions for you.
This is just ridiculous.
get in contact with the rest of us as soon as possible so we can grasp the situation.
That's the first thing that should be on your mind!
Could we try going to the bathroom more often when we're not switched?
Perfectly. Right, Aoki?
It's times like these when we have to trust each other.
I'm... sorry.
It's just that you're in Aoki's body right now, so I jumped back.
Is it anything I can help you with?
and that they make us who we are.
But souls, or personalities, are neither tangible nor visible.
Though, I'm probably overthinking it.
Oh, come on. Seriously?
Okay.
Okay. If that's what you want, Mom.
How'd we get on this topic anyway?!
Selfless freak.
That way, no one has to suffer through it.
Shut up, you hopeless wrestling fanatic.
Really?
But Iori's definitely the most vulnerable.
I always treat you so badly because I don't know how to react.
Um...
So, if you don't mind, will you go out with me?
q0But when I see her making such a girly confession... My heart!
Inaba-san, if I die socially, I don't think I can go on living normally!
I'm mad at you too.
Why would you think that?
I...
I'll go and calm her down.
You're pretty sharp, Aoki.
I hurt Yui pretty badly.
You said that I was amazing,
How can we save Kiriyama?
What scares me is that you might just do it.and not think twice.
After this show's over, okay?RINAAAAAA
Actually, could you forget about it?
Kiriyama...
Over and over.
I was thinking that the both of you might not know how to approach me anymore...
That's exactly why.
it's more trouble if you stay afraid of men.
Even just watching is pretty painful.
It might mean trouble if someone saw us.
Come on, hurry up!I want to hold hands with Yui
You really can't do anything after something like that.
One clean hit and I've won!
Go get 'em, Kiriyama.
I thought he might be responsible.
This has nothing to do with Heartseed.
Kiriyama will give us a hard kick tomorrow.
What kind of question is that?
It's not fair to use your poor health as an excuse.
You really have so little trust in us?
Yeah.
Don't decide things like that on your own!
The other day, you were saying how Taichi and I were all...
Plus, I have a feeling that Yui's starting to fall for Taichi.
I almost forgot.
All the more reason to not do it.
I just chose to joke that I didn't have a joke, got it?
Do you mean that your mother keeps getting
"You need to start living your own life."
How can you be so sure?
You swore that I could spill my guts and nothing would change!
I don't think I can suck it all back up.
Iori, you can go back to the classroom.
I'll make sure he gets some rest.
No, don't be.
Don't say that it's because you
I'm the one who needs to change.
I'm in horrible shape today.
my very best friends.
But you could swipe some change or something.
you trust me more than anyone else does.
since the day I was born.
Yeah, you can't help people who don't suffer from any trauma.
So I'm going to tell you
You spill yours, so I have to spill mine?
Yeah.
or in normal society, for that matter.
I'll decide after that.
Perv!
Still...
an8That's the only exception!
Then we're in the same boat.
I don't think it's something I need to be in the infirmary for.
Right?
Especially since Yui and Aoki wanted to come too.
Who cares if it follows?
Threatening me with your health isn't fair!
Right, Inaban?
or feel uncomfortable around her.Help me.
Is that really okay?
Like how you said Taichi and I were...
But you really are "hi-ho, the derry-o."
And you know, Yui might be falling for Taichi too.
Don't forget that kindness can hurt people too.
Inaban, you promised not to tell anyone.
Too presumptuous.
Okay, guess I'll start.
But it's not that I actually didn't have a joke.
I just decided that the joke would be that I didn't have one.
Taichi, you're so easy to bait.
Or rather, I never let it get that serious.
So you're getting along with your mom?
What did I want to do?
Taichi!
You can go back to class now.
Don't say "I just want to" or "we're friends."
So you wouldn't help me if I weren't useful to you?
Isn't saying it that way kind of unfair?
What are you worried about?
You told me that this whole thing is a disaster.
Are you sure you're not the one suffering the most from it?
Am I your enemy?
No!
but it's not like you couldn't steal a few coins every time.
Sometimes I think that I could have as much fun as everyone else if I could just trust someone.
I don't have any trauma like Iori or Yui.
Being distrustful of others is how I've been since I was born,
q0If that's the way you were born, it's probably not a big deal.
I'm sad you'll never be able to trust me,
Nagase, Kiriyama, Aoki,
you still have me.
I'd probably die socially.
Inaba, k-keep it down.
And that's how it is.
Then I make sure he hasn't taken anything I own.
I won't do anything bad in your body.
Well, at least I got a juicy secret out of you.
Nope.
overlapOh, so you did!
Will you go out with me?
No way!
So,
So...
Huh?
Pretended she switched? Why would she?
I don't know why eith
Perhaps it's the way of the world for couples to only be a man and a woman.
She didn't need me.
I even promised you, but...
What are people? What is the "self"?
This was definitely all my fault, anyway.
I'm really sorry.
They're all you.
Yeah. Starting somewhere in the middle.
You're all much too interesting.Sorry if this is a dumb question, but isn't "amari omoshirosugiru" the opposite of this line?
You...
Yeah. He could've been lying,
Either way, we have to deal with the situation.
Then...
It can't be any other way.
Killing another personality and taking their body is a sin.
Taichi...
Thanks.
My problems don't seem as grave after talking to you.
Not really, but I thought you might tell one.
But you're sadder than me.
Who will it be?
I won't ask you to forgive me,
I hope so.
Nagase made a full recovery from her injuries,
Three weeks ago, I confessed my feelings to Nagase,
So, the Yamaboshi High School Cultural Research Club is back to life as usual.
They're both on clean-up duty today, so they'll be late.
We can't do it if you don't take them off.
Why is it broken?
Let me see.
Did something happen?
My body just started acting on its own.
We haven't had a chance to talk
You were acting the same way just now, too.
What are you doing, Yaegashi-kun?
q3This morning, some boys from Akitaka High started hitting on a few girls from our school.
My dad just happens to be pretty high up in the police department.
So Kiriyama and Aoki never showed up today.
Hey, there's something that's been bothering me.
That's been bothering me, too.
Wait, did you hear one, too?
Oh, right. I haven't apologized to Nagase-san.
q3Simply put, I'm unleashing the desires you hold in your hearts.
Kiriyama's absent again?
q3The first is to keep yourself from experiencing any extreme emotions.
And Aoki can take care of Yui
Wait, Inaban, aren't you coming?
but I want to keep our distance right now.
I hate myself for thinking things like that,
That's another part of who you are.
I think you can see your true self in how you live your life.
Yeah, see you.
Sure, I guess.
But the only CRC members in our class are you, Inaba, and Nagase.
Couldn't you tell me that without hurting me?
Shut it, siscon!www
I called her earlier and asked if we could go visit, but...
I'll kill him.
Her hair's pretty! She's tiny! She's pure!
You're right.
I have to save Kiriyama!
Could you guys stop screwing around already?!
You didn't look very intimidating.
It doesn't look like our desires get unleashed for very long.
If you can't act on them right away,
they might just end without anything happening.
But isn't whatever incites our desires being unleashed usually right in front of us?
What does Balloon Vine want this time?
Wait. My eyes don't always look lewd, do they?
You really might be the one in the most danger this time.
Who knows what'll happen if a desire like that got unleashed.
might really die this time.
If we go there looking like that,
It's only me right now.
She locked herself in her room and refuses to come out.
Don't worry about it, Mom.We need a way around this joke.Will try to think of something. Coming up blank right now, though
I'll go back to school soon.
Sorry for coming uninvited.
If not, we can go home now.
There's a huge zit on your forehead
I made a huge mistake!
N-No!
Balloon Vine is to blame for that.
But will Balloon Vine think that's interesting?
I didn't mean to go that far.
Hey. Not going to help her out?
I'm sorry, Setouchi-san.
You don't need to apologize like that.
Later.
Shouldn't we visit Kiriyama today, too?
I know you feel bad about what happened yesterday, but
Don't give up like that!
I keep calling Inaba, but she won't answer.
It's just the three of us heading over to Yui's today!
I'm sorry!
Kiriyama's suffering right now,
But I should've been able to.
OP
Then again, you can say the same about us.
Don't you want to save Kiriyama?
So what?! It beats being useless like you!
It's nothing.
That's no good.
No, nothing like that.
Six groups, please!
If you already have someone in mind, feel free to form your entire group now.
I haven't had any good moments.
You know what I mean!
Nagase!
You're in a group with Watase-kun?
Two of them!
Oh, Yaegashi?
I know.
"If you keep playing it safe, you'll lose something really important."
Leave it to me.
Preview
Hey.
and hurting you, too.
I never thought I'd ever hear you say that we'd need to hurt each other.
But you know, I think you're doing the right thing,
Yeah!
But I was wrong.
I knew you'd beat me to it!
I'm really sorry, too!
She went home before I could talk to her.
Just us wanting her to come out isn't enough.
Seriously?
Yui, it's me and Taichi.
I don't know when or if I'll hit someone.
You'll be fine! I know it!
You'll be able to hold back if you
Whether you want to stop or not won't matter.
With every fiber of my being!
And not to brag, but I've got a dirty mind.
No!
You won't be in any danger.
Stop imagining things like that, you creep!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
q3But it's nothing more than speculation right now. We don't have any actual proof.
What?!
Eyecatch
We didn't know if we should've visited or not!
Really? Sorry.
Hey, did you put on some weight?
You're imagining things!
Now if only Inaban would come to the club room.
All three of you?
Shut up.
Inaba-san, you're practically a shut-in now.
Just to stop me from interfering?
Or at least I hoped you would.
It feels like it's been a while since we talked like this.
ED
Pull yourself together!
Inaba!
OP
This kind of stuff makes for good memories later on.
I don't need memories of doing crap that I didn't need to.
I mean, it looks like Inaba-chan is almost back to normal.
Crap!
Don't underestimate me!
We're done washing the rice.
Yeah.
How could you not?
I'll go with her.
Inaban!
If you're anxious, then tell someone!
I'm not a good person like the rest of you!
If you think...
You don't need to do anything crazy.
No, that's not exactly right.
I...
I'd just get in the way of you and Taichi.
I'm not lying.
I thought it might be interesting I mean, best if I told you.
You're not making any sense!
Fell?
You don't mean... from there?!
I finally made it back.
You wanted to talk to me about something?
I'm really happy that you feel that way about me.
Oh, and I told Iori that I'd be confessing to you.
No need to mind either of us.
He go!
What a coincidence, Inaba-san, Yaegashi-kun.
But no one here knows who wrote it.
Can I have some?
Let's eat them together.
Okay, next question.
I was so bright and breezy.
There's a building scheduled for demolition by my house.
Wait, hold on, Onii-chan!
What do you mean?
but not the Balloon Vine you know.
missingKnight?
If you do...
This has to be a joke.
Promise?
Yeah. Mihashi Chinatsu-san.
What, your boyfriend?
Yeah.
That's amazing!
There! I win!
I'm faster than you!
Oh, right. What about clothes?
Crap! They need to change clothes, now!
Hey, whose is this? Can I drink it?
What is it?
No, no. I don't really want to think too hard about that.
It's really cold outside!
They're so warm!
Then as thanks...
My, you're in perfect sync!
Yes.
Don't mention it!
milk.
I never thought I'd ever hold Iori like this.
I talked to Mihashi-san about how strange you've been acting lately, and we decided to follow you.
Whose baby is that?
Kiriyama lost.
I'm Kiriyama Yui!
I'm in love with Yui now.
Are you okay?
I'm going out for some air.
You're distracting me.
That's good.
You've been out of the house every day since New Year's.
Well, yeah.
Shut up!
But our promise...
I'm doing everything I can right!
Sorry it has to be me again.
My promise.
I'm completely worthless now.
We need to do something.
But I don't think Yui should be here for this.
Back then, I decided...
We were kind of close, so it was a real shock.
It made me think, you never know when someone's going to die.
But that's why I decided to enjoy life to the fullest.
That's your philosophy?
Right. I don't know if it's right or wrong.
It should be around here.
Sorry, I just had to see you.
I see.
I came all this way just to tell you that.
We need to take the overnight bus home.
missingYeah.
It's not about what you look like.
If I don't want to be a side character, I just need to become a main character.you were in taichi's body once
I won.
You might think that phrase means "I'm the best in the world,"
but it doesn't.
but one day, I'll make sure you know that I'm Kiriyama Yui.
But my mom and sister are really mad at me right now.
I'd love to take a bath, too, but we can't right now, right?
Oh, sorry.
Wait, what do you mean?
Because...
You won't depend on us and you're still trying to do everything by yourself.
Taichi, stop talking.
Don't keep it to yourself and do something stupid.
See what I mean?
Go. It's okay.
So what do we do now?
Huh?
You weren't?
It seems I've caused you quite a bit of trouble because I wasn't involved.
and let you relive everything from whenever you want.
All right, then.
Maybe I was...
I didn't mind putting up with him if it meant my daughter was happy.
Hurry it up!Should this be on the top of the screen?
I'll be fine.
I can't
You guys are the reason I'm here now.
So that match didn't count!
and our lives went back to normal.
I already turned you down.
But I still feel the same way about you,
I like him.
Sorry, it's not you.
Can we go back to the classroom and have lunch?
Iori and I switched places.
So...
I'll cut to the chase.
and I don't want to ruin that.
Yeah, go ahe
Move, Fujishi
I'm guessing that you're the one she needs.
That was all my fault.
What do you mean?
tell a joke before a serious conversation
There's no such person!
That just means you like a lot of things.
a club because it looks easy.
That's pure sophistry.
I love you, Nagase Iori.
You can probably guess who I am.
Heartseed...
Nagase!
And they managed to get in touch with Iori's mom.
Hello there.
Yeah, he could have been lying.
If someone has to make the sacrifice,
Right, I'm not doing this for anyone else.
I'm a selfless freak for my own good.
Gentle, awkward, and stupid, seriously...
Please switch me, Aoki Yoshifumi, with Nagase Iori.
I could never bring myself
Oh...
Um...
Oh? You're the only one who doesn't seem too different.
Not really, but I figured
Why are you the same as always?
I don't want to die.
Right after you told me that you love me...
That wouldn't be much of a relationship.
Of course.
i1Wait...i0
Anyway, did anything strange happen?
Sure. Have a seat, Iori-chan.
Right.
It sounds like you stole my first kiss?
A Story That Continued Before Anyone Realized It
Three weeks have passed since that body
by working hard on the StuCS paper.
In any case, peace and quiet had returned to the
Are Yui and Aoki around?
Don't you find it annoying to have to wait all the time?
whoever happens to be around, right?
H-Hey!
Ow...
I-Inaba!
Get off! Get off!
What's wrong? Does it hurt?
A-Actually, I just had a sudden urge to see you, too.
You too?
I still feel the same way I did then.
What?!
Why would the police take Aoki and Kiriyama into custody?
You rang?
Um, I don't think anyone was talking to you.
when asking for a favor, Inaba-san.
Yes...
I'm sure that Nagase-san will be happy with the deal.
Dance practice?
That's all.
It won't come free.
Kiriyama beat up boys from another school, right?
voices in your heads yesterday?
Stop messing with us!
I would like to say that I'm sorry
Our desires have been unleashed?
True selves...
All I have to say is that hiding in your room
could be just as entertaining.
That really hurt, Inaba-chan!
And Kiriyama's absent again today.
Yui wanted to save those girls
Under normal circumstances,
What are you talking about?
But that won't work when our desires are unleashed.
violence against other people.
to avoid any stress build-up.
Hm? Is it a bad idea?
It makes sense to help each other.
Falling Apart
You missed out big time
Oh, so you've got your sights set on Nagase.
why were you late?
Ow!
Falling Apart
Shut up, sister lover!
Say, Taichi...
Yahoo!
I managed to convince everyone that I
"Yahoo!" in the middle of class?
But I can't help it.
I should think about Yui and calm down.
Not good! His desire was unleashed!
Calm down!
or stop this episode if we override
It's worth a shot.
Just like last time,
No way, why?
Along with Inaba-chan and Taichi!
Can we come inside?
Are you Yui's friends?
Leave.
No, I'm just going to say the
I'll let you in, so stop!
It would have been more fun if I got to say more stuff.
Are you feeling sick or something?
You don't get to be the only one who hides in her room.
Do you understand the current situation?
So?
But Kiriyama's hurting right now.
There are times when I'm too busy with my own problems.
Inaba-chan knows that you meant no harm.
And Then There Were None
It feels like we're losing people.
Inaban's a lot more sensitive than she looks.
But if she keeps this up...
Oh, Inaban!
Are you a masochist?
for the main event, making curry.
Limiting the number of members
We want six groups, Fujishima-neesan!
Don't you understand?!
Get away from me already.
I want you and Nagase-san to get along.
What are you doing in the classroom by yourself?
We'll have to do some cleaning up first.
No, not really.
I'm telling you to talk to a friend.
Oh, I know.
everything will work out.
Wouldn't you rather try and fail?
I suppose...
Were you impressed? Eh?
Uh, I'm not sure where to start.
Let me ask you this, Yaegashi-kun.
So you need romantic advice?
Who are you, Fujishima?
Ta-Taichi!
and I realized that I'm a selfish and self-centered person.
So, if you don't mind, can I stay by your side?
that it doesn't matter if we hurt each other.
Yeah, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
This doesn't feel right.
First, I'll talk to Inaban.
It hurt because she was right.
Let's sit down.
Let's enjoy our youth!
If Kiriyama has another episode,
If we're really careful and try our best...
You'll be fine, Yui!
You can stop yourself from beating someone up!
if you try really, really hard to stop yourself, it'll work!
come to school,
and come to the clubroom, right?
That's despicable!
Let's spend a night in a love hotel.
Why would I put myself in danger?!
the other day when I had an episode.
I'll go then.
So...
please stop me.
Huh?
I'm really sorry.
You too, Kiriyama?!
Three at the same time?
Himeko, you have a visitor.
You spent all your time outside class alone.
You always put up barriers.
but you had no friends
you'll try to destroy the world.
Yes, there most certainly is.
Can I sock you real hard?
an8Come on, Taichi!
Hey, Inaba!
If you use this trip as an excuse to do
Burnable Trash
Uh, I'm sorry.
I have the worst possible luck today.
That could be a factor.
Yours look a little rough, Inaba.
So what if Taichi gave you a little compliment, Iori?!
I got the rice.
Not always.
Delicious!
Um, are you listening to me?
Yeah.
Wh-What is it, Iori?
Where did Nagase and Inaba go?
Tell me why...
What's that supposed to mean?!
You're looking for someone to support you,
I never realized that Inaba Himeko was such an idiot!
If I show people how weak I am,
You're a much better person than you realize.
That's not the point.
It's okay, Inaban!
I'd only be a third wheel.
Everyone would feel uncomfortable.
You were trying hard to protect our friendship, right?
She would never give up, no matter the odds!
Using people to her advantage!
So you don't need to worry.
Anyway, you were pretty intense.
Ow...
Hey, that was uncalled for.
I'll apologize!
Inaba, Inaba.
Inaban, Inaban? What's wrong?
No idea.
Ah, uh...
I'm happy to hear you say that.
I already knew that.
You took my first one without asking.
I'll see you in the clubroom tomorrow.
Thank you for your hard work
- Just now, I found out about a huge secret! - Here you go, some fried egg!
Yummy...
You mustn't tell anyone about that.
Don't ever talk about it again.
Please sign here.
Daddy...
Right, thank you.
you won't ever get scammed by a telemarketer.
An egg?
So what did you end up doing?
Yeah, the color balance is great.
Takumi Sakagami.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH COMMITTEE MEMBERS TAKUMI SAKAGAMI JUN NARUSE DAIKI TASAKI NATSUKI NITO So anyway,
It isn't our problem!
I'm gonna go complain to Shimaccho.
Damn that Shimaccho. Who does he think he's dealing with?
They're calling you.
Okay, I'll be going!
Everyone was so pumped up, thanks to Daiki!
And thanks to their ace, who'd flourished into an elite talent,
- Sorry! - We'll be right there!
Then give me some names. People who could handle it.
That might be just the thing!
Recitations and choirs, year after year.
Is that right?
you'll receive this perk.
- I know it! - The one with the yellow brick road, right?
What? But that would be the same old, same old!
Class?
Mu...
I bet everyone's gonna vote against it.
See you.
Naruse, by any chance, do you actually want to do a musical?
What's this?
dont you think you should try singing?
Out of these?
I dont think it's half bad, this idea.
But it is impossible!
Sakagami.
- I feel sorry for the younger guys on your team.
Hey, cut it out! What's your problem?
Why?
Hey, dont be jealous!
Who, me?
Why didn't you get on?
Did you go to that castle with him?
Yeah, what should I do?
I've been so busy lately.
It's disgraceful.
All right.
Another one?
I dont get it.
I want you to do what you did with that egg song!
Naruse?
Into a beautiful...
song...
Naruse!
I was in the middle of something- -
Good evening!
There are a bunch of show tunes in here, see.
I can't write songs from scratch, so...
Even if you dont sing, you display exactly what youre thinking.
Text me if youre running late.
See you.
Before we head to the diner, I want to stop by somewhere.
For doing this without telling you.
Does that mean you dont mind?
what if I was serious about doing a musical for the Community Outreach event?
And then- -
Tasaki is on the committee, after all.
- Cups are over there. - There's no point. Right, Yamaji?
- Mishima's pretty ineffectual.
Are you okay?
- Excuse me, youre disturbing the other customers.
Is this that curse thing again?
Be rebellious if you want to. I dont understand.
Of my job. Of the way you are. All of it!
I dont know...
It was tiring to express my feelings or argue back to someone.
What's that about?
The block association dues. Thanks for that.
If I keep this up, everything about me is half-baked.
Really, I'm overcome with joy!
True...
but as committee members, we'll do everything we can!
The costumes, too?
Well, I did say "a bit of..."
Yeah. I think it works.
At least youre a human!
What's wrong with that? I bet you'll look cute!
And of course, all the main characters were forced upon the committee members.
Naruse, you just need to write the lyrics for the ending, right?
Do you think you'll be able to say what you really want to say?
Coming! Oh, my, welcome!
S-Sorry...
Well, at least in number.
Aizawa and Iwaki should be here any minute.
Nito and Naruse will come after they're done shopping for the costume people.
We were briefly an item- -
Taku, your friends are here!
Everybody must be there already by now.
Naruse, have you been to Sakagami's house before?
It feels so strange. Going over to a friend's house, going shopping with a friend.
I think it matches the melancholy of the ending.
When Iwaki said classical music, I wasn't sure what we were gonna do!
- Apologize to Master Beethoven! - Okay...
They're quite good, you know.
My mom who left us, and...
Can I help?
That's so admirable of you. To realize that yourself.
The part where she shouts out, "I love you."
It felt that her repressed feelings were really precious to her.
In this musical I saw years ago,
I left you hanging yesterday, didn't I?
I couldnt do anything. I couldnt say a word.
That's not true that something or somebody being 100 to blame or wrong.
why dont we somehow convey both of them?
Sakagami, youre amazing. Youre amazing.
Would you mind playing it again?
iPrincei
Community Outreach Event ArtsSports-related
Okay, let's get to it.
Then let's start with the big stuff...
Really, Ikkun, youre such a bad boy!
Because youre in love, aren't you?
I've got to put them into words.
That day, when you tried to reach out to me...
Sorry. I dont want to hear it now.
The about-to-be-hatched yolk...
Community Outreach Event
And her voicemail's--
Hey! When you two went back to the classroom yesterday,
Then that sound we heard...
Naruse heard what we were saying.
She was so frantic. Even though her stomach hurts her when she talks,
Yoko, let's go over the part where the formation changes again.
Dammit. What are you doing, Naruse?
Maybe.
All this time...
Once upon a time, in a certain land...
Naruse.
I can't go back anymore.
Because my prince doesn't exist anymore.
My stomach will start hurting again, dont you see?
There was never any egg, and you know it!
There is!
I need him to exist, or I'd be lost!
Even knowing that it's a ball for criminals being held at that castle.
The girl makes a desperate appeal.
- The worst outcome would be to mess up this musical, right?
Well, I guess youre right!
Jun Naruse!
Words...
You pretend to be kind, but youre such a hypocrite!
She's a liar! And she's a goody-two-shoes!
But then I met you.
but you do have so many things you want to convey.
And I started to realize that maybe there were many things
I wanted to tell someone and I wanted to talk about.
Thanks to me?
Not my fault?
They're waiting!
That's your punishment for your crimes!
- It was really cool! - That was a little nerve-wracking.
No, that's not- -
And I'll give you a proper answer.

The Cutting board is standing by
Good morning. Is Sora up yet?
- I like it that way. - Me too.
You can share your mother's.
Thanks.
Please go ahead, everyone.
Nobuko, over here!
I could, I just don't have enough time.
That was cool.
- I'm home. - Welcome back.
Grandmother? It's me.
But isn't this too much work for you?
Then you won't need those flags anymore.
I'm finished for the day.
- Today's spots are very distinct! - And they form a straight line.
Don't they ever clean this place?
New members! How long has it been?
We're just heading for the Archaeology Lit Club, actually.
Now don't be shy. Shall we discuss existentialism?
Show some respect, you second-rate alchemists.
Yamazaki...
Do it for her, hero.
Your hand...
Then you need this.
Shall we go?
This is nice.
Don't you feel well?
Umi, wait!
I believe we must accept the board's plan!

The physics midterm forecast was a big hit.
to my farewell party?
We need more glasses.
My great-grandfather loved cats.
So Mom ran away and they eloped.
He said they helped him find his way back to us.
I'll open the curtains.
Isn't he handsome? That's when they got married.
- Shun, what about dinner? - I already ate.
Here we go.
Hey, watch it!
It's so filthy.
Did something happen?
You're my son.
Sawamura was a good sailor.
Thanks, Dad.
Not yet.
lf you don't like me, just say so.
Sora, did something happen to Umi at school?
You're such a big girl now.
- Come on, no more freebies. - Why not? Business is good.
Unbelievable.
No, I told them yesterday I'd be absent.
Thank you.
Escaped? I did that a lot myself.
We spent hours making it look new. Please see for yourself.
What does your father do?
Yes.
It must've been hard for your mother, raising you alone.
It's settled. Tomorrow afternoon.
I can't afford much tuition. I'll apply to a national university.
I was busy learning every day.
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?
I wanted to ask you something.
Yuichiro registered the baby as his son and brought him home.
Your father was so good-hearted. Maybe just a little impulsive.
Without his help, I couldn't have finished school.
Does he look like this picture?
Umi...
Have a nice day.
The third man in the photo is here.
Stand fast, sink not
Should the world sink
We all did it.
Something very important is happening to both of them.
Umi?
That's my dad's tug.
Front row, fourth from the right.
Here we go.
Tomorrow's love is a refrain
Words without end
Will you hold me in your arms?

For you this is easy, right?
Komi-san? Komi-san!
Osana-san, come with me for a moment.
What do you think Komi-san is like?
I've grown up since then,
But, Osana-san, you're misunderstanding things!
But you see, today I've been working hard enough already.
Do you like her? Eh?
Ah, no, someone like me is in a different leagu,e well below Komi-san.
so I helped you write LOVE on the schoolyard...
Stop, don't mention that!
after you were gone, I noticed something...

 Good morning, Najimi-chan
There were a few obstacles, but I greeted Komi-san!
There is no way anyone would believe that!

Go on and rub your scent on everything!
Don't misunderstand, Komi.
It doesn't make sense for you to be near Komi.
You agree, don't you?
You'd be happier with more popular friends.

You're so busy with class council stuff.
Are you okay?
There's no standing up to you, Onemine!
-WANTS TO HELP -Komi, will you help too?
Really? But the teacher said
I can just make Tadano do it. Life's good!
I just can't mind my own business. Always been that way.
Are you
After all, Komi is so beautiful and hard to approach.
Is it?
She really doesn't.

Got it.
Sorry!
That's between me and Komi.
an8IT SEEMS THAT PHOTO STICKERS ARE POPULAR THESE DAYS.
-I WAS THINKING IT SEEMS FUN -Yeah.
There are a lot of different types.
Hey! We're starting!
Komi already has big eyes, so you'd just look like an alien.
Huh?
Yeah.
Good morning, Komi.
Here.
I figured maybe you wanted one.
It's not like It's okay if you don't want it.
At this time, we can only find the girl who was our senpai.
Stop!
Here's a question. On that Sunday night, the girl who went to the hotel with Wataru was...
And if she left the dormitory too, it would lower the number of people here...
And thus, Tsugumi dormitory would be dissolved.
The dormitory will surely be dissolved.
I... Do not wish to part with everyone.
The wrath of twelve people The following plan
To you, this could be a painful meeting to watch.
Even so, as a student, to think Hoshino would engage in such a shameless action...
Firstly, how about judging for one time?
Let's move this discussion along then, to develop the discussion to the point at hand...
To be so carefree like this...
Is there something wrong, Kirishima-sensei?
Since the Principal is saying this...
Please do.
That's why this decision is to dismiss Kirishima-sensei.
At this rate it'll only drag the time of the meeting on.
Wait! Wait a moment!
As for me, up to today, I have always regarded Kirishima-sensei's appraisal as a little erroneous.
Why?
Up to now, Hoshino has been suspended three times for failing to follow rules. There was one time the past half year.
Wait a moment! To consider the number of offences is not wrong. But he has definitely changed.
What do you mean by that?
I remember. I remember. That fellow singlehandedly fought it out with five people.
The second time was at the Takamitsuka Festival last year.
For the sake of a friend, Hoshino did what he thought was right, but he created a disturbance.
The first time was violence.
Hoshino was just doing such.
I don't. I have not looked into it.
I reckon it could be Hayama or Sawaki.
Even if it's raining, we'll continue the meeting.
Two of his cases had the police alerted.
Ah... Takashi-kun.
And at that time for punishment, every case had a suspension of one week.
According to him, it was because there was a dormitory-in-charge and teacher, who was like a big brother and protected him with his life.
I propose a decision. As of now, I think there will be a different outcome.
Regarding Hoshino's expulsion from school as punishment for mischief, for those who strongly oppose, please raise your hands.
A complete transformation of Tsugumi dormitory into a hotel?
And then we'll have an approval of eleven and opposition one.
be1
be1Who is she?
be1The first time I met her.
be1The population of the island was growing.
be1However, both nature and the companys activities are respectfully well balanced.
be1Is it true that nothing happened?
be1Umi, what happened to you?
be1Let's devote ourselves to excellence.
be1Come here, go inside.
be1Transfer student... It can't be.
be1Isn't it our first meeting?
be1Sharing a bed?
be1Err...
be1For Shizu, it's her second experience.
be1
be1
be1If theres something you don't know just discuss it with Kirishima-sensei at the Tsugumi Dormitory.
be1That girl is the sixth dorm member?
be1
be1I won't answer anymore questions unless you ask me in private.
be1Let's eat, let's eat.
be1Don't get this wrong.
be1Because it is so noisy outside, I want to take a walk.
be1I don't remember asking you.
be1Go back together, eat dinner together, then say "Good Night" to each other.
be1Temizugawa Heavy Industry...
be1March of next year,
be1Asakura Naoko...
be1You're wrong.
be1Hoshino Wataru, it's only me.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
You wrongly drank sake instead of juice, then fell asleep, right?
Takashi-san, coffee please.
Right away.
By the way, this year we have the marathon festival.
No, there's a strong person that will likely be the winner this year.
Oh, take the umbrella.
Shut up Takashi-san!
Okay...
Are you going to settle this with Rock-Paper-Scissors?
No, I have another good way to settle this.
It's okay.
In your condition, you won't be able to run 10 kilometers, right? Just retire.
If you don't want to retire yourself, then I'll retire too.
And, leaving the dormitory is okay with me.
Wataru.
But I know about him.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Things that aren't happy, always... I always feel this.
Then, win the race.
It's finished.
Ah, err...
I told you before, right?
Give my tears back!
Yes, why?
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
What did you do Hoshino?
My first time meeting Miya was last year in the summer.
I'm Rokujou Miyaho.
Yes, I only meet him when I was a child.
Actually, I came here because of this building.
After this, I must visit another place...
I wonder.
In brief, she became the successor since Rokujou grandfather passed away last year.
The nail is bent again.
O-okay, next time...
Slow?
...The only clues are from relatives.
He stopped teaching, and entered Temizugawa Heavy Industry.
I'm really sorry, mistress.
He likes to talk to flowering plants.
Senpai, the next one is this person.
Yes.
Elgar-sensei started teaching in the second year of spring.
To say that about him, he's popular.
Ah, thanks goodness the dust didn't get on me.
Although it would have been better for him to have done something.
Just play on the sand...
I'll protect you Miyako! Get out of here!
Bring some miso from home, get fish from here, and then make nabe.
be1Then?
be1I don't want to.
be1Really? Are you sure you can do it by yourself, Miya?
be1I'm not angry!
be1Please, enjoy yourself.
be1Is this the picture of when Mr. Chairman was still a teacher?
be1This must be him, the one with shaven hair at the back row.
be1...Kiichirou's feeling towards this island will...
be1You just made it become past memories like this huh?
be1But for now, with the time at our hands, with everyone...
be1Summer vacation will end someday.
be1The things that you don't understand.....
be1Miya left Tsugumi dorm, and kept herself in Rokujou Mansion.
be1I'm afraid not....
be1but the whole thing will be fine if the man apologizes first.
be1You said it before, a month has passed since then.
be1Only one part left...!
be1HE IS OUT HE IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.
be1Yes, yes...then where is your home? The address?
be1No It smells good...
be1I got a frost bite...Stop fooling around!
be1S-Senpai is so selfish!
be1Wh...what are you talking about?
be1That is....
be1After all, it was all right if I think about free research easily.
be1Yes!
be1Hey, be careful!
be1This cake looks delicious!
be1Someday is...someday.
be1Like my grandfather, control the academy from behind the curtain...
be1...Likes pachinko, she really likes it.
be1But, she doesn't like Shizu. How about Wataru?
Pay attention, or you'll get lost.
Konohanatei.
This is Kiri, our head attendant.
M-My name is Yuzu.
I can wash myself!
I've prepared some of my kimonos.
Shush. Just come with me.
Konohanatei was built on the second highest point in the city, after the gods' shrine.
So this is our special privilege.
Yes.
Oh? You can't do it, huh?
I imagine your older sister is hard at work with her employees right about now.
We have guests.
U-Understood.
Okay.
Use this.
Yes.
What the hell are you doing?!
But I didn't do anything worth praising.
I told you what?
That was...
i1Yuzu.
We don't know that.
Correction... The five others.
You don't need to do everything she says.
Oh, yeah, Nacchan. You blew your nose on your obiage, didn't you?
Who cares if I did?
We're washing it, anyway.
Sakura-chan?
It's fun being with you.
She made me realize I've been too caught up in seeing only what's around me.
Oh, right. I'm going to have you two sleep in the same room.
She said it's fun being with me.
I've never slept next to a friend before.
It's kind of nice saying that... before... I go to sleep...
I know how you feel, Satsuki,
I-Is something wrong with Satsuki-chan?
i1You aren't going to get out of Konohanatei just because you work especially hard.
I know that.
I don't drink at night.
I'm sure you're tired, too.
Unbelievable!
I can't stand it when girls are indifferent about fashion.
She still has all kinds of expressions that I've never seen before.
Kiri! Kiri!
How cute!
There are more shops over there.
fad696,1Dango
She still worries about me, even now.
I got separated from my sister.
I-If it's okay, I'd like to help you look for her.
Hey! You there, girl.
I'll roll around and wail.
What kind of threat is that?
I'm not lost!
That's all right.
To the north.
All of the others have already gone ahead.
My sister and I fell behind.
She's self-centered and tactless and...
S-Someone...
Let's make flowers bloom on the dead tree!
See? There you go.
Oh, my!
W-Wait, Ayame!
Do you see the silver-haired priestess?
That's my older sister.
It's not that I've given up.
She's so kind.
I never knew it could make me so happy to touch someone's heart.
Let's go.
Welcome to Konohanatei.
It's fine. Leave them to it.
Your hair smells nice, Onee-sama.
Nobody shows up for us except on New Year's.
Beautiful!
I'll bring a hatchet and a small knife right away, sir.
If I don't use it, it's only going to rust.
It can't ever fly if it's a katana.
Or else I'll lick you.
I don't know how Konohanatei was back then, but I think...
I haven't seen her before.
Isn't she the gods' companion?
Yuzu-chan, can you take it?
Who is she?
I'm bored out of my mind.
We're going to have gods again today.
The gods are busy around the new year.
Kiri's asked me to assign work.
Ren!
That's no good.
Yuzu...
Ever since, I get light-headed whenever I see a pair of scissors.
Except Sakura.
That's what happens at the end of our lives.
I need to go back now.
You can stay here.
Fine, fine.
What's wrong with that?
I just boiled some soba that I bought at the store.
Should we go this year?
Especially since we have Yuzu this year.
Those are people who work at shrines, right?
I would have never dreamed that my life would be so lively.
I'm busy, you know.
The good cough medicine is on the third shelf.
I came here to ask about this scroll.
What do you think, Tsubaki?
What's your name?
I know, but...
It's fine.
If there's anything I can help with...
It's hard, but the people who make wishes at the shrine
I want to dig up a hot spring and relax a bit.
But...
I can't go back to being who I was before I met them.
Haven't you thought that maybe you could go home if you'd written in a scroll
that you want to go home for the sake of someone else?
but there might be someone who'll hear her wish.
Hot Springs Galore
Sure, do what you can.
The shrine where she worked was washed away by a landslide.
Konohanatei
Why are those kids out so late?
Yuzu, that scroll...
Why do you always show up out of the blue?
You can't wander off like that.
Sorry for making you worry.
I wasn't worried.
You'll have to help when we do, Tsubaki.
It's a hot spring inn for the gods.
It couldn't be.
It was Yanagi, wasn't it?
to return to the people who await her when she becomes lost.
Hurry up, Nacchan.
I don't know.
Ren was like...
She's always acting like a moron.
B-Be careful from now on.
I found her!
Yes. My name is Yuzu.
Oh, no! What have I done to a guest?
How dare you treat a guest like that?
Ban us?
and clean better than usual...
Just hearing about it makes me shudder.
an8Ouch...
between Satsuki-neesama and Nacchan.
Coming.
Yes, it must be at least a hundred years.
I'm so glad we came.
What?
Oh, by the way, Nacchan, I saw you fighting in the yard.
That's not the point.
By the way, Ren, tomorrow...
It would be boring for such a young girl to be in the bath with such an old couple.
Okay, I'll show Aoi-chan around town.
Sad and disappointed?
Yes, so instead of scolding your friend for resenting another person,
You know, that she's sad, and that she wants her attention, too.
That would come across as really annoying!
Nacchan would never think that's annoyi
That's good... Harder...
Ren, you know peeping is bad.
Aoi-chan's dream is to become a sumo wrestler someday.
so I took him to town, where we could talk to a real sumo wrestler.
Oh, that's all?
I asked you yesterday if you wanted me to get it, but I guess you couldn't hear me.
I'm going to take a bath.
Konohanatei
Huh?
Because I said so.
What was that scream?
We've been sleeping in the same room together every day.
It won't come off.
I'm not going anywhere.
How are you feeling, Ren?
Quit being so suggestive!
a6The Akebono room.
a6Which room is it, then?
Indeed.
So you're telling me you gave me your spot?
You hid yourself away, and now you're blaming me for it?
I could never bring myself to say this.
If it didn't matter which of us would become a priestess, if it didn't matter who,
You were having a nightmare.
Work just doesn't get done without you around.
Kiri-san's so useless.
See you soon.
Good thing it was the bad part you forgot.
I said I forgot!
Speaking of dreams, isn't there a beast god that eats nightmares?
What was it called again?
Make this baby stop crying.
Looks like he's not interested in the baby.
I think that's fine.
The boss hasn't said anything about it.
I hope that's what happened.
First a baby, and now a lost kid?!
Let's take her...
Damn it! Today is cursed.
Shino-chan, come over
Where did you leave your kimono?
Um...
My, what's the matter, Shino?
I don't want to wear this!
You're a girl. You have to think of your own ways to be stylish.
Wh-What are you talking about?
I washed them for you, since you never will.
She's gone.
would dress a doll in wedding clothes in her place,
so that the daughter would marry in the afterlife.
Her final kimono was finished this morning.
I've lived a truly fulfilling, dream-like life.
It truly was like a dream.
Our guest has just departed.
Next Episode: The Spring Rains Bring With It
Priest, what is this doll?
What's the matter with these people?
This is the first time I've seen Sakura-chan smile.
It's that defeatist way of thinking that makes you ugly!
Sakura-chan, give me the scissors.
Now she just needs a kimono.
Thank you.
You must have been made with a lot of care for a really special girl.
What about the cleansing?
Her name is Okiku.
Yes!
I'm a top-class Japanese doll made by a master craftsman!
That makes no sense to me! Hey!
Leave it there, please.
But she hasn't touched her food at all, either.
That's so wonderful!
U-Um...
I-I'm sorry.
This is something only we sisters can weave, because we serve the heavenly gods.
But this isn't finished yet.
I'll let you be the first one to see it. It's our secret.
Next Episode: Konohanatei Horror Stories
Will you like me now?
Sorry.
There's one extra.
If you see a ghost, get rid of it.
I got lonely being by myself at night, so I asked Bikuni-sama to stay with me.
Who's switching today out with tomorrow?
Satsuki-chan?
Satsuki-chan's an amazing person, but she's still just a normal girl.
Her face...
It's not like I'm disappointed by it or anything!
It's such a pain, going around and turning on all the lights.
I thought you were afraid of me.
It's late.
You're the real one.
It's ghost season. What can you do?
They're seasonal?!
I couldn't say no to a face like that.
What should I change about myself?
Then why do you say that as though it were truth?
I'll think about it.
What was that noise, Yuzu?
What makes you say that?
Bikuni-sama!
Yes.
Konohanatei will stay as brilliant in your heart as flower blossoms in full bloom.
A lot of people.
Just being with them fills me with gratitude for that miracle.
Yeah.
The guests are all going to the festival, anyway.
I'm not particularly interested.
If you don't go, these two are going to be wandering around town by themselves.
Are you sure you don't want to go?
Yo, lost kid.
My, what cute children.
Yeah?
It's to invite the spirits and give them comfort.
She's our apprentice.
She's gone through some things, and we're taking care of her now.
Being here would be a good cleansing in itself.
Go straight. Don't get lost.
Anyway, I have to get going, too.
You're late!
Sorry! I was dancing, and I got lost.
What?
I'll head to the kitchen.
Whoa! This dude's amazing!
Aren't there more mature ways to have fun?
Come on...
Oh, no.
Go drown in stuffed squid and return to the sea!
A-And they're naked!
Guys, can I join?
Sweet!
I know. He's so skinny, too.
I wore these new sandals for nothing.
Because there's a real gem next to me all the time.
I forgot about the fireworks.
Let me down.
I want to walk barefoot.
Oh, that makes sense!
I won't get to be with her once I'm home.
Do your feet hurt?
What's that, Sakura?
Um...
I got separated from my friends.
I'm sure your friends must be worried.
I'm not looking for my friends, either.
To deceive someone is to take something from them or to hurt them by lying.
I hope it comes back.
I wish I had someone like you around me.
Are you okay?
Who are you?
You do.
Say what?
Hey!
Dad, Mom, Takahashi-san...
See you again.
He vanished.
I must finally be losing my mind.
Yay! I win.
You've gotten so fast, Kaito.
Kaito, have you been well?
Did you find something?
Kaito-san.
Now you're just being manipulative.
Okay.
No. You're still alive.
And really, "Hell"?
You don't want to go home, either, Mister?
So that's why you left home.
I thought I could become anything when I grew up.
Seriously, why are young girls like that?
In the end, we're all dancing on the palm of God's hand.
You're the only one who thinks they haven't figured you out.
Damn it! I'm never coming back!
I'm going home.
It's been so long.
Yeah, I have a new family.
Bye-bye, huh?
The volunteers took lots of pictures for us.
It's been lonely since our daughter moved out,
What's the problem, Satsuki?
If you wouldn't mind, would you kindly flip me over, please?
She's got serious eyes!
You've saved my life.
Could you please remove the rope, as well?
Really?
who went to the sea when he lost Umisachihiko-sama's fish hook?
Do you mean there's no work?
How embarrassing.
Look, we're busy today.
Normally, Okami or I tend to the VIP rooms...
I'm going to ask you to take care of Awanami-sama.
I'm counting on you.
I'm nothing but worried.
Sorry.
So she's Awanaminokami from the Kamiumi myth?
Konohanatei
She has such beautiful, porcelain skin.
Scrub harder, please.
Please don't tell Kiri-neesama.
What is this?
It's all right.
She's already scheming something!
There.
Are you okay, Okiku-chan? Urinosuke?
I grew up in the mountains. I have a ton of stamina.
Okay.
I was wrong, too.
But how did this happen?
I'm sure Kiri would know why this happened.
Well, I am sorry for the trouble.
The cursed doll is staring at me with jealous eyes...
I can give out orders.
It's fine.
Why would you say such a thing, child?
She had a cane, and her feet were dirty.
Sorry.
That was anticlimactic.
I imagine it's troubling her.
But how did I suddenly get back to normal?
In what way would I be pushing myself?
N-Nothing.
Can a dull girl like you really make it?
I shall accompany you.
If you screw this up, my reputation will be ruined.
What are you, a kid?
Might as well join me.
You used to cry and beg to take a bath with me.
Once I'm free to resign, I'm going to aim to become a priestess again.
Maybe.
And Hiiragi-san wants Satsuki-chan to become a priestess, too.
The princess wishes to see the kagura dance.
Are the moon dancers not to your liking, Princess?
Well...
Please, as an attendant, dance for our guest.
So I know you can do it.
It must have been so painful.
If the guest is happy, so am I.
You were testing Satsuki, weren't you?
Mother wanted Satsuki to come to Konohanatei
And it looks like she has some good friends.
I was going to invite her to the shrine
Aren't you going to tell Satsuki-san what you said?
Unbelievable
If you don't have proof, I won't accept it.
As a public morals committee member, I'm measuring the length of the skirt.
Konoe too, and so...
Senpai, where are you looking?
There... There was a ghost...
This is slimy. It feels gross.
You're good!
We keep shooting and shooting, but they're endless.
Good grief...
What is this? Power cut?
This is...
N-No, I don't.
Actually, I need to ask you for a favour.
It does look a bit similar, but the tail is totally different.
but the only one who came was Director Genda.
By the way, Rinka-kun, it seems Mikadono Kumagorou's only son is attending Miryuuin Academy.
Mikadono Shougo-san, right? I know him well.
Why would you want to know about that?
Eh? Engaged?
I had secretly taken the mobile phone that I found back home.
The time drew near right before my eyes during the inspection of the board of directors.
It was like the other me was whispering into my ear.
I should be sorry because being tied to family and honour, I couldn't refuse such a wicked request.
That's impossible.
Besides, the discussions have already moved forward.
You don't have to get married when you don't want to!
I can't tell a lie to deceive my own family.
Senpai...
I'm your lover after all!
It's natural for me to make you lunch.
Lover?!
It seems like my father has taken a liking to you.
Everyone, it's time for the customary Shiga-san check!
Okay, now it's time for my sexy preview.
You get the participation prize.
be1Miyabi, what's with that skirt?
be1You know what I mean.
be1If it's more than 10 centimeters above your knee, I'm making you wear track pants.
be1Don't move. I can't measure it.
be1Maybe I'll hike up my skirt a little too...
be1It'll be difficult to get information from her.
be1President Tendo, if you're that scared, maybe we shouldn't do this...
be1What? Soft serve ice cream?
be1I'll treat you.
be1Don't stare at me like that.
be1It's so slimy and disgusting.
be1Oh no!
be1Maybe it's a raccoon dog?
be1What do you mean?
be1This.
be1I have no idea what you're talking about.
be1Yes.
be1Well, well. Mikadono-senpai, I thought you were smarter than this.
be1Isn't that right?
be1It seems there's no point in hiding it any longer.
be1Just as you deduced,
be1I want information I can use to my advantage.
be1As though my other self had whispered it into my ear, I suddenly came up with that plan.
be1Now that things have already progressed this far,
be1Kunitachi-san, let's become lovers.
be1Huh?
be1Senpai...
be1Oh yeah! Why did you suddenly quit being a morality officer?
be1Why, you ask?
be1Next is episode 9,
Miyabi, what's with the skirt?
It's so short I can almost see it.
You know what I mean.
If you lift your skirts any more...
I didn't see anything!
you're just a boy and a girl.
It will bring you closer together.
What is this?
I'm not scared of zombies.
I'll get some soft serve while I wait for you.
Thanks for waiting.
Don't stare at me like that.
This was the only rental swimsuit they had left.
It's so slimy and disgusting.
There!
Don't kick them! Shoot them!
Kunitachi-san, calm down!
I thought I had seen this before somewhere, so...
It's not a bear.
What are you...
Are you saying I did that?
By the way, Rinka-kun,
Then are you familiar with this rumor?
I had taken the phone home with me.
Yes.
You have nothing to apologize for.
Bound by my family and status,
Wait, Kunitachi-san...
he approves of us dating and someday getting married...
What is the meaning of this?
I can explain...
Mikadono-san had been bedridden since half a year ago.
Who are you?
Yes.
It will be your new home starting today.
You're looking for someone to marry.
R-Right.
It's a cream puff, so it should be fine.
Yeah. I'm Mikadono Shougo.
I know, right?
You sure do that a lot.
"Mikadono" just reminds everyone about the Mikadono Group.
I see. Your memories...
Yeah, but why did an empty can just...
And Vice-President Kunitachi-san.
I'm gonna finish all the snacks if you don't hurry!
Hey, Shougo.
Didn't you want people to call you by your first name?
I was having a nap up on the tree and just happened to overhear it.
W-Well, Konoe was just looking at my scar...
You don't mind kissing any classmate, so it'd be weird if you couldn't do it with me.
Like I said, I wasn't trying to kiss her!
It's from Konoe?!
Who exactly are you?
He's a little pervy, though.
If I really did have a sister with the same father but a different mother...
Oh, morning.
So if the person I pick to be my companion turns out to be my sister...
Tell me the reason you've been transferred to Miryuuin Academy.
Shougo.
So you're my Senpai?
So why were you spying on me?
Looks like I'm right.
I wonder if what Mister X said yesterday is true.
You said my mother knows about my father's illegitimate child.
Ballroom dancing? You mean boys and girls dancing in pairs?
Nice to meet you all.
Would you be so kind as to give me your seat?
My sister will be trying her best to conceal her identity, though.
Indeed.
The effects wear off after a week,
Shougo-kun, may I use your shower first?
I left them drying on the balcony.
The Mikadono Group's stocks are doing well again.
That's good.
The company's presenting their new cellphone with additional functions in a day or two.
Please! Go put some damn clothes on!
N-No, not at all.
It's really quite something.
S-Someone lent it to me, so I had no choice but to wear it!
I can't.
Because...
There you go.
Because if I do, you're going to see them!
Fine.
I bet you'll take a peek.
You can look now, Shougo-san.
Hello?
That might be nice too.
Good morning, Shougo-kun.
You could've told me.
D-Do you get it now?
You don't have to recite it!
Did someone call me?
I was taking a bath.
If you say "I want to marry my sister" ten times, then I'll tell you.
Maybe "I love my sister"?
There. I said it ten times.
Thanks to you, I'll have sweet dreams tonight.
Wait!
Onii-sama.
I'm sorry.
Anyone can experience being an Onii-chan or Onee-chan.
but we figured it was better than being gay.
Anyway, you should get dressed and have some breakfast.
You just don't get it, Tsuruma-san.
That's right, Miyabi!
Hey! Where'd you find that?!
A-At this rate, I won't be able to...
Well, you were both snuggling against me...
Huh?
If only...
Shougo-oniichan!
You're diligent, quiet, and seem like a model student, but the truth is...
It's not that I don't like it...
Well, let's say there's a girl I can't date because of a certain reason,
This is purely hypothetical. A general scenario.
It's true that there are many forms...
Shougo.
And I have something to do...
It's just April.
Huh?
Uh, Shougo?
I figured it'd rain, but...
Why would Miyabi have something from such an old series?
Miyabi, I'm happy that you like me.
But we can't.
Also, it's water-resistant.
What's wrong?
I bought a brand new car the other day.
Konoe said she'd help me out when it was my turn to clean up.
Where the heck is she?
Hello?
By the way, what I just sent you is a picture of that recalled sample.
Please help me find Konoe.
Find Tsuruma-senpai?
Help me find Konoe.
Why should I?
Then you already...
Do you remember the photo I sent with the cake on your birthday?
My dad and Kumagorou-san were old friends.
Hurry up already!
Watch out!
but my dad and Kumagorou-san started to drift apart.
and said it was because you trusted me,
I couldn't bear to look at your and Kannagi-san's faces.
So if you're feeling down or in a bind, let me come save you.
Wh-Wh-What are you two doing?!
Then please, go ahead and explain everything.
What?!
Miyabi's dad was also being treated for an injury there...
I was always really close to my father, so we went to the hospital together.
and I couldn't see you anymore.
W-Wait, you two...
Okay, we'll start the battle tomorrow morning.
Seems like you've realized.
Didn't the principal say that in one of the morning assemblies?
H-Hey, wait!
an8I'm so tired from being woken up way too early...
You woke up early?
One of the class rep's duties is to ensure students have a proper school life!
Mikadono-senpai, congratulations!
...sister!
I've been looking for you, Mikadono-senpai.
As the only son of the Mikadono Group ex-president,
Mikadono Shougo, the number one guy people want as their Onii-chan...
Ooh!
Yeah, well, I haven't been getting enough sleep...
Mikadono.
Sagara-senpai.
Promise me, Onii-chan.
There are also some exciting and kinky resources that are best kept hidden.
Huh?
Um...
What is it? Does it feel rude because I'm older than you?
Why would you knock on wood?
I-I can't sleep...
She's taking her time.
Sorry I took so long!
You took your time, Miyabi.
Well, sorry about that!
Welcome back, Onee-chan.
I'm your slightly cheeky and somewhat precocious little sister!
Onii-chan, Onee-chan.
Not really...
Today's the "Young Sister Wife Day."
I just wanted to test out this new cat tail equipment.
My current name was given to me by the orphanage.
Does that mean your being born in March is also...
What's that supposed to mean?
My dad left to lecture at a university in Massachusetts.
That's not it.
Collect information?
Huh? Sort of...
What'd you say?!
Is that rumor true?!
By the secret power of the Dark Cat King from the Demon Realm,
He wants me to live the life of a researcher.
Mikadono Shougo-kun...
It will all end according to plan.
Oh, she just laughed five times.
Mm. There's a special little gadget inside.
I'm heading off for training now.
Oh, Miyabi!
I can't wait to see you swim at the meet.
Now for the all-important taste...
B-But I'm not elitist...
Elitism is a very fine moe quality.
Thanks for coming over.
Sorry, but could you help me look for it?
It's not quite naptime yet.
I guess there's no point in playing dumb if you already know that much.
Yes, I remember it very well.
I couldn't forget it either.
I see.
First, she'd cause you sleep deprivation by calling you early every morning.
but it didn't work very well.
I'd seduce you for your wealth, only to be tragically rejected,
I guess that's the gist of it.
My, my.
You were acting as a decoy to draw my attention away from my real sister.
Am I right?
Then I'll protect her!
I guess so.
Hey, Kannagi-san.
No, he's having my bread!
You always do this when you walk home anyway, right?
It's been a while.
Please.
Huh? I'm not supposed to?
Because you had this really pervy face when you were rubbing it inside Tsuruma-san's mouth.
It's me, your sister.
The next time you try to find me, I'll expose all of your secrets.
Please believe that Mikadono Shougo doesn't have a sister.
It's the only way everyone can become happy.
Konoe still has her cellphone with her.
but I could no longer find it.
Only a handful of people would know to use the phone's voice changer like that.
We, the student council, need to take action at times like this.
But I like how fun the school is right now.
Yes.
Starting tomorrow, you'll be wearing that and correcting behavior around the school.
Together, we make up the special high-class disciplinary committee.
During the time the sister's message was being broadcasted,
Yeah, I guess.
If all goes well, we might get our answer!
All right. Enter.
and summon Chaos upon this present age!
Women are very delicate in both mind and body.
Tsuruma-senpai!
Why are your boobs so shamelessly big?
And you too, President Tendou!
If it's that short, people'll see them!
Geez...
Do you want to look inside my skirt?
Shougo-san!
Any higher and...
I don't want to hear your excuses!
Senpai, what do you think you're looking at?!
Rinka-chan's family is really strict.
I'll have one! I'll have one!
K-Kunitachi-san!
Wh-Why are you wearing that swimsuit?
Kunitachi-san, calm down!
But amusement parks aren't so bad, right?
I-It's fine.
It's so nice and furry!
Are you going to buy it? As a souvenir?
I just got the feeling I'd seen it somewhere before, so I...
Got it? You need to be careful of those around you.
Kunitachi-san, I'm sorry.
Kunitachi-san, can't you cancel your engagement?
You shouldn't marry someone you don't want to.
Well, Senpai!
Shougo!
Well, everyone, it's time for the regular Shiga-san's Check!
What?!
O-Okay... Yuzurina.
C-Could you give me an explanation?
Huh?
Onii-sama, your sheets have been deeply stained with the scent of a woman!
Well...
It's only natural for a sister to be worried about her older brother!
I'm not saying you can't have a girlfriend.
Yes. Yes.
It's no good?
That's enough, you two!
Nothing wrong with cooling off just a bit!
Yuzurina, why are you...
I was in the area and figured I should find out more about this school,
but I'd be more at ease if we had some objective proof.
Mikadono, you're quite the womanizer.
President Tendou, are you even listening to me?
It was just the dressing area!
What the hell are you doing?!
I'll arrange for a test immediately.
Wow! It looks so good!SO MUCH MEAT
Wh-Where is he stimulating her?
The girls' dorm is just over there.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow then.
Mikadono, you're not thinking the Perin-chan show would be better, are you?
Sorry.
I can ask them to prepare invitations for your friends as well.
It's a formal witch's dress.
Yeah.
very difficult challenges face our Group, the importances of which cannot be played down.
Turn! Turn!
Did something happen?
Shh.
Yes. I'm counting on you too.
Calm down, Shougo-kun.
Seri-san's deceiving my mom too, right?
Ms. Kanoko trusts Secretary Seri completely right now. We don't have objective evidence to convince her otherwise.
And if we told Ms. Kanoko now, she'd find out who the illegitimate child is.
I...
Asking her to prepare the DNA test was just like telling her who my sister really is.
Oh, that's all?
One time, Daddy Kumagorou sent me a letter along with my living expenses.
Huh?
Show the world you can devote yourself to one woman alone.
Devote myself to one woman alone...
Yes.
All right.
That's probably why she can't be honest with you despite her feelings for you.
If Kannagi-san ends up becoming your girlfriend...
Shougo!
Shougo, let's smooch!
We noticed and tried to warn her, but she took the glass and emptied it in one go.
She found me!
Are you okay?
I see.
I'll have a shower to wash off my sweat.
Wait, that's not the issue here...
B-But I'm not m-mentally prepared yet...
Then I'll help you with that.Then I'll make you mentally prepared.
Shougo, please.
You are.
I'll be by your side from now on.
I see.
And anyway, you never take anything seriously!
To begin with, I'm not exactly happy that you invited five of your school friends!
Huh? Seri-san said?
She said you really needed those invitations.
Rinka-chan, today's party was so much fun!
Onii-sama!
Onii-sama, are you all right?HNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
What are you
Onii-sama?
But you did say you were my sister...
If you ever catch a cold, I'd like you to give it to me
H-Hey.
S-Sorry.
Are Marie Chocolate's puddings one of their specialties too?
Oh, thanks.
Oh, one second.
Why?
Sorry it took so long!
Yeah! This is really good!
I had a feeling that I had seen Tsuruma-san before when we met,
But after talking about the funeral this morning,
That's not what I'm saying...
I'm your younger sister.
Huh? On the day of Kumagorou-san's funeral?
No, not a gravure shoot.
Miyabi looked really excited.
Wow! This look delicious!
This one looks good too!
And this one looks delicious too!
Sorry I took so long!
Like that could happen.
Oh?
Nice! Nice!
Just the top is enough!
U-Uh... Thanks.
Yes!
Um, Senpai.
Thanks for today.
Yuzurina, do you have some time to talk?
But what if I started going out with my blood sister without knowing it?
I did think it'd be wonderful if you and Kannagi-san were to fall in love,
That's right.
Why won't you believe me?!
Or maybe I should call you...
playing Perin-chan in Cyborg Soldier Grand Bellion.
And without knowing it, you told me about it.
I've failed at my job. I'll disappear soon enough.
Calm down, Mikadono.
Drowning?!
I see.
I can't let that happen!
Would you mind talking for a bit?
The exam was on a different day for you.
Right?
It said that the money was for living expenses and to use it to make his daughter, me, happy.
Losing your family is a really painful thing.
I wouldn't be able to marry you if anyone found out.
My mind went blank.
I'm not his sister. I'm just a relative.
But you'll need to bring the letter to the party.
You didn't give her the letter?
I realized that I had fallen into a horrible trap and panicked.
Houshou-san asked me about a lot of things.
What a shame.
Oh, Kannagi-san...
Onii-chan's mine!
Because we're siblings.
ShougoI already said I can do it myself!
What are you doing?!
Why would I need to forgive you?Begin match to episode 12.Matched.
We're siblings.
Quit it!
We're siblings, you know!
You should have my handmade lunch instead!
Excuse me, what do you mean by "cheap-looking," Kunitachi-san?
Okay, stop right there.
As Shougo's sister, I'll decide which lunch is worthy of him!
Pick 'em up and have a look!
Come on, come on!
Well, that's just how she is.
No matter how you look at it, it's gotta be way beyond its expiry date!
Why are you participating too?
Choose as you will!
Welcome home, dear.
It'd be like that wife cafe we visited earlier...
I'm back.
but the mood's getting too good!
It's just a matchmaking interview!
Preparing a funeral is pretty tough work.
Oh, Seri-san.
Building a relationship...?
Hey
This is a pretty strange phone.
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right.
Th-Thanks.
Is there a problem with that?
an8N-No, not really.
an8All right.
He's kinda hot!
I see.
N-No, it isn't really...
so my memories from back then are kind of hazy.
There was some dust on Shougo-san's hair, so...
Konoe-chan!
And Vice-President Kunitachi-san.
Well, Kannagi-san...
Didn't you want people to call you by your first name?
Smooch me, then.
Fine!
Refrigerated food delivery here!
Yes.
And the girl with me in the photo...
Who's this?
Hello? Who's this?
Happy birthday!
We've been separated for such a long time,
You were watching me at the time?!
Give me your name!
Shougo-san.
Hey! Stop!
Why are you spying on me?!
And what would your secret agency want with me?
You said my mother knows about my father's illegitimate child.
The only people who'd know about the illegitimate child
I see.
A dance party?
Wh
Sensei.
H-Hey...
My cute little kitten.
I'm trying to keep your sister's scheming hands away from you.
You just need to collect her saliva using a kit and send the sample to a lab.
H-Hey, let me see too!
I get the feeling we created a huge misunderstanding instead...
It's a general rule in covert operations to eliminate as much body odor as possible so others don't notice you.
I'll be right back.
The company's presenting their new cellphone with additional functions in a day or two.
Will this timing result in good or bad?
Sorry I kept you waiting, Shougo-san.
Does it look weird on me?
H-Huh? How come?
You'll ruin the reputation of the student council!
Well then, maybe I should get a little serious too.
causing the girl in the center to dance elegantly like a queen.
This is the ideal way to lead a dance, steering the girl as you please!
Hold me too!
Ow...
Out here?
Did you see?
No, I didn't! I didn't!
I don't trust you.
Who are you?
What do you want?
When we were hugging earlier, I bet he wanted to see them!
He wanted to touch them!
He tried to hide it, but I knew!
Shougo-kun.
Oh, that's right. You're a g
TEL
TEL
TEL
All you need is a hairpin to unlock the door.
While I was showering, I thought of something good.
Have kids? Are you nuts?!
D-Do you get it now?
So you basically shoot your sperm inside me, and when it meets with my egg
Shougo, good morning!
What?!
What a coincidence!
Looks like us siblings really do have things in common.
I don't want to see my sister's naked body!
Maybe "I love my sister"?
I love my sister...
Thanks to you, I'll have sweet dreams tonight.
Onii-sama, over here.
Oh, you're finally up.
So why are you two acting like my sisters?
I'm going to help you get dressed.
I can help you get dressed.
And why are we sleeping together?
A-At this rate, I won't be able to...
That's right!
then I'll know my sister isn't Konoe or Miyabi!
Are you feeling hot?
Wh-What are you doing?
Th-That's right!
Ah, it's nice and cool.
We'll teach you everything that's good about women.
If only...
How is it my fault?
Wh-What is it?
C-Closet...?!
Of course.
It's not that I don't like it...
I can't really do that either.
but the two of us are getting closer and closer by the day.
Rinka-chan, where do you think that line is?
Oh right, you're in the swim club.
Huh?
So they've expanded beyond electronics to swimsuits in no time...
I figured it'd rain, but...
You got all wet from shielding me, so I can't possibly send you home like that.
I'll be using it later.
I'm your younger sister.
I'm serious.
Please give me a proper answer.
Hey, Rinka-chan.
Oh, Onii-chan?
Besides, your voice is different.
Let's get going.
What is it, Tanaka?
Huh?
Konoe said she'd help me out when it was my turn to clean up.
She always calls me out of the blue, and just...
Huh?
However, they received criticism right after the launch.
Kunitachi-san.
Why?
Wait!
Where are you, Konoe?
So that's where you are.
I...
That day was no exception.
Hurry up already!
You looked at me and said, "did I protect you like Grand Bellion?"
It really hurt, and I didn't know what to do.
Dummy.
You could've just told me about it.
Wh-Wh-What are you two doing?!
How do you explain this?!
Marry?!
...friends?
That's why I was really happy when I heard you were transferring in!
It was like God had finally listened to my prayers from when I was a kid.
W-Wait, you two...
Fine. I'll take you on.
Okay, we'll start the battle tomorrow morning.
Turns out she got the Crabzeus shampoo at the hospital store and had been holding on to the bottle ever since.
but she's not Konoe or Miyabi.
Quick, or you'll be late.
So, can we please play newlyweds?
It's a dream.
It's not a dream, Shougo-san.
Shougo-san, you forgot about the kiss I gave you back when we were kids?
Promise me, 'kay?
Do you remember how I came to see you at Daddy's funeral?
I'm worried it might go soft when the time comes...
Shougo-san, what's wrong?
You're spacing out...
Are you not getting enough sleep?
But that sister's voice can't be produced without using the voice changer in Tsuruma-kun's cellphone.
Wait!
But...
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, why?
I came here for you, obviously.
Geez, Shougo. Why would you do that here?
Would you like to join me?
This mat's kind of small though.
Thanks to our birthdays, we're one school year apart.
Exciting and kinky resources.
This should be it.
I'll have this Omelette Rice of Love.
Oh no, I ran out of space!
What?!
You've finally come to my cafe.
It's common for kids there to take the day they were picked up as their birthday.
I used that money to buy back my mother's cafe.
I have many memories of my mother there, after all.
I'm pretty sure I had it here somewhere...
In other words, it's possible that she's either a year older or a year younger.
Oh, it's you again.
all the girls in the academy grow cat ears and tails!
Sorry if my being delusional has caused any problems!
Because...
He wants me to live the life of a researcher.
He's stranger than I'd imagined.
Uh, I have no idea what you just said, but there's one condition for the interview.
Very well.
That's all you've been doing lately.
Of course I can!
D-D-Did you see?
Oh, Miyabi!
President Tendou?!
O-Okay...
I'll need to sketch this.
Or maybe here?
Huh?
But uh... why "Oniichan-senpai"?
Good luck!
Huh? I don't remember ordering this.
Ooh, Kunitachi and President Tendou!
Welcome back, Onee-chan.
we can give birth to a brilliant child that has both business acumen and a taste for what's moe.
Ikusu? What are you doing here?
She'd be able to look into my room from there.
And she'd use that phone to call me every morning...
But why would she go to the trouble of doing that?
The sister on the phone's been looking into my room from here, right?
I suppose I did make a big mistake, though.
After all, it's the day I first exchanged words with you.
Indeed, it was like it'd all been planned out beforehand...
but it didn't work very well.
I guess that's the gist of it.
What a strange guy.
Please continue to be friends with my sister.
Next week: Episode 7.
I... I think so too,
Let's see...
Collect the mucus from inside the cheek with this cotton swab.
In the long run...
Hey! Why are you stripping?!
Miyabi, wait up!
It's nothing perverted, I swear.
You pee maniac!
Th-This will be on your midterm, so be sure to remember it.
Huh? Me?
But I thought Mikadono-kun was an only child.
The next time you try to find me, I'll expose all of your secrets.
Sorry I kept you waiting.
Only a handful of people would know to use the phone's voice changer like that.
Wait a minute!
but from now on, the student council will take the initiative to correct student behavior on campus.
Uh, I understand the situation, but why do you want me to join the disciplinary committee?
You're a celebrity at this school.
Yes.
Excuse me.
If all goes well, we might get our answer!
Shaft.Bamboo
That was three screams.
It's gonna be awesome! It's a scoop!
No secret photography in school!
No!
I know!
Women are very delicate in both mind and body.
Hey!
But you won't know for sure unless you measure it!
Your skirt needs to be as short as mine to be against the school rules!
Hey!
I didn't!
Well, I...
an8Well, Miyabi was like... y'know, and Konoe was like...
You see, as a special high-class disciplinary officer, you're supposed to supervise the students.
Changing the location?
As long as you're in the school, she'll be the vice-president, and you'll be a disciplinary officer that takes her orders.
However, if you two venture outside the school, you'll just be a boy and a girl.
I figured things would go better if, instead of asking Kunitachi-san directly, we had President Tendou ask her.
I'll pass.
Huh? Soft ice cream?
You two, make sure you come back alive!
Don't turn into zombies!
I'm a little tired.
That's nice! Maybe I'll buy one too.
It's not a bear.
I just got the feeling I'd seen it somewhere before, so I...
Then you used this phone's voice changer and called your phone, so the voice went into the microphone.
Well... uh...
It's true that this strap has a different tail from the one on the phone that Sagara-senpai lost.
I know him quite well.
as if another me had whispered it into my ear, I suddenly came up with that plan.
Senpai, please close your eyes.
Huh?
You'll take responsibility, won't you?
So why did you suddenly quit being a special high-class disciplinary officer?
Next week: Episode 9.
Shougo, morning!
See what?
Anyway, your skirt's too short!
Do you want to look inside my skirt?
Is Miyabi using seduction to get me to quit being a disciplinary officer?
But you won't know for sure unless you measure it!
I didn't! I didn't, okay?!
It'll be difficult for her to warm up to you.
Wait, President Tendou!
What's this?
What's this?
I'm cool with this.
I'll pass.
There we go!
Kunitachi-san, calm down!
I-I didn't mean to do that! It was an unfortunate accident!
Kunitachi-san, you like this kind of stuff?
I'd like a favor from you.
I thought you were smarter than that, Mikadono-senpai.
I know him quite well.
It's something our parents decided.
I couldn't simply turn down a request from them.
It's something our families have already decided and arranged.
You'll take responsibility, won't you?
IMPOSSIBRUJust a lot of effort
What?!
What?!
Um, is something wrong?
If she finds out I'm Daddy Kumagorou's illegitimate daughter, I don't think she'd take very kindly to me.
It's only natural for a sister to be worried about her older brother!
You'd want me to find love? Really?
Yuzurina!
Yes. Yes.
Yet...
Well, Mikadono?
Hey, Miyabi!
But Tsuruma-san looked at my boobs and said she was envious that they barely seem to have any water resistance!
And this is the pool!
You're all having fun.
I was in the area and figured I should find out more about this school,
That's why I'd like you to keep what we'll be talking about inside this room.
Daddy Kumagorou has been paying for my expenses ever since he entrusted me to my current parents.
Stop fighting, everyone!
A-Anyway, calm down, everyone!
When everything is clear and ready, yes?
Eating out every night is bad for your diet.
I-I'm the dessert!
My times didn't improve even after practicing all day.No duh. You get tired, and then your times get worse.
Huh?
Geez, there you go trying to avoid me again!
Next week: Episode 10.
This will still go on for quite a bit!
I just hope Kanoko-sama won't be angry about it.
My foster parents are first cousins to Daddy Kumagorou.
Not exactly...
Then it's...
However, in these uncertain socio-economic times,
There are many other things I would like to say,
She isn't answering my calls either.
It might be a good idea to look for her.
I hope she's not lost.
but the envelope and stationery were specially made,
and the handwriting is most likely his.
Ms. Kanoko knows for a fact that she has enemies within the group.
Thanks.
Asking her to prepare the DNA test was just like telling her who my sister really is.
What's wrong?!
How about in the lounge on the third floor?
but it's Daddy Kumagorou's scandal.
You're right.
Yes.
but I haven't been able to accomplish that because I've been looking for my sister.
I can now find a girlfriend without any worries.
Smooch! Smooch!
Did you do something strange to her?
That's right!
H-Hey, Miyabi!
What's wrong?
One of the hotel's suite rooms.
I don't want you to go away!
Don't worry.
Um... How is Kannagi-san doing?
Really now?
Hmph. Fine.
I'd love to show it to you all next week.
Onii-sama!
Onii-sama!
Thanks for coming over to make breakfast for me.
Yeah, a lot of stuff happened.
If you ever catch a cold, I'd like you to give it to me
I see.
Yeah, I was just feeling kind of tired.
I see. That's good.
Konoe's taking a while.
Kiss me.
H-Hey...
Huh?
awatetetaI knocked over some sugar in my room because I was in a rush.
Konoe was at Dad's funeral?
an8Aoyama.
an8Here!
Kannagi.
P-President Araya's the same as ever...
Guess I'll go home.
So she's a little different from her usual self.
What if...
Why is this even happening? It doesn't make sense!
You burst in without knockingRAEP
Sorry I'm late.
You're late!
TEL
TEL
I'll take you somewhere nice as a reward.
Somewhere nice? Where?
I'm really happy that you love me.
I have no other choice at this point.
Huh?
Plotting?
but that was because I wanted the best for you as your sister...
But that wasn't the truth.
Yet you're suspecting me of something...
Or maybe I should call you...
It was me on the other side.
Senpai!
Calm down, Mikadono.
No, I was just lying down with my eyes closed.
I see.
If it's about what happened yesterday, don't worry.
That's not what I need to apologize for.
Right?
Looks like you know everything.
That's right. It was me.
That's why I knew right away that Houshou-san was lying when she said she was your sister.
But then I figured I got lucky since you wouldn't suspect me of being your sister anymore.
Hey, what are you talking about?
Well... Yeah.
I told her that I knew she was a fake and asked her to reveal herself.
From Kumagorou-san.
If it really proves that you're his sister, I'll give you my full support.
She invited everyone else because it'd be weird if you were the only one.
You didn't give her the letter?
I then spaced out for a while in the cafe.
Houshou-san...
Miyabi, I want you to listen calmly.
So don't worry.
Onii-chan's mine!
Shougo-kun's so popular.
This is usually my brother's job, but he has a cold so...
Don't mind the gravel on the floor.
Look. We're almost there.
Sadness enveloping
Will salvation ever come?
I have to ride the train back home with my dad.
How do you know my name?
I'll greet our uncle, aunt and grandma in Kusatsu first.
Please have this... watermelon.
but it's not all bad, being young.
Grandma.
That dusk, everything looked hazy but gentle.
Suzu, put it lower. The wind could blow it away.
Mom, can you give me 2 sen? I lost my pencil.
Oh, you're cold!
Nice job, Urano.
I'll gather some pine needles for kindling.
It's my brother's, I have plenty more.
I'm done.
December 1941
Okay!
Women who end up in Manchuria must be using tongs.
Oh, gosh!
Don't be silly!
No idea.
It wasn't easy to find your house.
Where is the train station?
Oh, him? He's an odd one, you see.
How did this all happen so quickly?
Please close the blinds facing the ocean.
Hello, Mrs. Kobayashi.
While I am lacking in my ways, I am honored to join your family.
Suzu!
See you when you come home to visit!
Mom, Dad, it's an honor to be part of your family.
Thank you.
Right! She's the daughter who got married.
Thank you for setting out the futons.
You must be hungry.
With my mouth.
i"Houjo..."i
Ah, yes!
She wore that on dates with her husband.
Those were the days.
My husband and neighbors lost their jobs. It was a hard blow.
But Keiko found a job and a husband all on her own.
We thought those times were tough.
Hello Harumi.
Also, that rice isn't a gift, it's for me and Harumi.
No one will marry you if you don't do it right.
I'm Suzu Houjo.
I'll go. Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
Hey, Mom!
Suzu! Enough sleeping! Get up!
Did you write to Yoichi?
He's stationed far away.
How's the volunteer corps?
You're getting a bald spot.
I will.
That's why you came back?
I feel bad for the Houjo family.
What for?
What did you tell Harumi?
- Please! - I said no!
You don't need it.
Welcome home.
That ship is a submarine tender.
and seven hundred?
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Use extra water for thin rice porridge.
the "food increase recipe" during a siege.
Saving rice and energy must go hand in hand.
Lord Kusunoki must have been quite bold and remarkable
There's nothing on the radio. Is Shusaku off to work already?
Don't fall now.
They need firebreaks.
That's terrible. I hope they can find a place to live.
You're welcome.
Don't worry. I'll find a job and work.
Can I have some of this dirt for our field?
That's amazing. You know so much.
He?
Yes.
You're a married couple. It's nice that you get along.
They got married and they renewed the store.
I need to check on the garden.
The military police?
We will not arrest her today, but keep a close eye on her.
We had to hold back our laughter.
Sugar is precious right now!
What?
Miss, no one will give me directions
For Naganoki,
Most of us aren't locals and we stay within these gates.
Are you from Eba?
I had watermelon at my grandma's every summer.
Rin!
I'll come back another time with more drawings.
Mrs. Houjo,
How goes it with the GKF?
I don't want you seeing me smiling ear to ear!
What if I bump into him?
Then you just say hi.
She must be quite useless here.
What?
Are you crazy?
Good night.
but it's without victory or defeat, again.
What?
I'm sorry about the room.
We have lots to talk about. Come.
Are you making a pen?
Everyone loved that drawing, and I didn't know what to do.
Was you.
until the end.
February 1945
Welcome home.
People are gone just like that.
And yet you've never shown your angry face to me.
Hey!
That's why we work day and night at the factory,
to improve their efficiency.
Survival kits...
April 6th, 1945
Where's Father?
Suzu, it's boiling over.
I'm sorry. I lied.
Let me see. Am I handsome?
Take care.
I'll get ready.
- What about school? - Don't worry.
This will take forever.
Push comes to shove, use your bamboo spear!
You idiot! I'm not scared of ex-in-laws!
We're gonna ride the train and see my brother.
that Harumi should go live with the Kuromuras. It's safer.
I want to tell my brother which ships I saw here.
It's so hot...
Are you all right?
How could you let this happen?
You killed her!
I'm glad.
The sun is out.
My house burned down.
Avoiding the shelter saved us.
I've had enough of this heat.
It's not new, but it's pure cotton.
Ouch.
The bombings aren't as bad.
I know. I'll come back if your officer friend is handsome.
07:00 hours, July 28th
Do as you please!
What a hot morning.
We're going to miss you, Suzu.
You'll never make it today. Doctors are busy too, you know.
Train tickets are usually sold out anyway.
What a boring life this must've been.
Cloud?
No one around here has.
What are these sandals for?
Hiroshima helped us before, now it's our turn to help them.
Silly girl. I'll trim your hair when we get home.
He walked all the way from Hiroshima.
Thank you. Stay strong, okay?
Please, come in.
I suppose it's the legal office's job
Yes!
Keiko!
From now on, this body will be here to smile.
Suzu!
He grows a beard and marries a crocodile.
We can't go back in time.
No, I can commute.
On your right is Mt. Yasumi, to the left is Mt. Hachimaki.
It pains me to ponder
Suzu,
He's a kidnapper and we're being kidnapped.
Let me see.
Thanks, Suzu Urano!
I'm so distracted at times.
Good morning...
Grandma.
"Must've been a zashiki-warashi, a house spirit.
I hope it'll last the week.
i"Reading"i
I'm home.
The rabbits are hopping about today.
Here you go.
April 1943
That's cold!
They say girls who hold their chopsticks up top wed far away.
That's just one village over.
Says Sumi, as she shifts her grip on her chopsticks.
I'm about 19... Well actually, 18.
But why?
Maybe he has me confused with Sumi.
See you then!
Thank you for setting out the futons.
We share the neighborhood well.
What might be the address of this house?
Nice to meet you.
What ways?
It's gonna fall!
We thought those times were tough.
I'm talking about you!
Ouch!
Not again, not like that!
I undo the seams and cut. Put them together and sew.
I'll go. Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
What should we do for soup?
Excuse me.
My pleasure.
Our mother has a bad leg,
That's quite a pile.
It's time for dinner.
for not letting me come visit sooner.
Take care.
What? You're leaving, too?
I wanna use it.
- Please! - I said no!
Here's a yellow one.
Look, over there.
Two thousand...
That's right. Let's welcome them to Kure.
They cook for 2,700 people on that boat every day?
I'll do better tomorrow.
the "food increase recipe" during a siege.
There's nothing on the radio. Is Shusaku off to work already?
They are removing buildings.
The family will move to Shimonoseki.
I heard them over Mt. Haigamine.
That's the Tone. She has no rear turrets.
I see. I also learned a thing or two.
Thanks.
Did you teach Harumi about warships?
You're a married couple. It's nice that you get along.
Hisao is the heir of the Kuromura family.
I wish we could all live happily.
The military police?
but who knows what nefarious plots she is scheming!
Is there anything suspicious regarding her background? Well?
I'm home.
I wonder where they're going...
We need to hide it from the ants.
But where?
in the water would keep the ants from it.
Isn't it over there?
Caramel?
I met a kind person once though,
Mint candy.
Let's go then.
A classmate of mine from elementary school
Changing my name and moving was hard for me,
Here. Eat for two people!
I'm going to bed.
Makes me feel anxious...
I asked him to sleep in the storeroom.
I readied the bed warmer. Take it to him.
Here. This is for you.
There...
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
You love him.
Welcome home.
There's no way Yoichi is dead.
I forced you to marry me.
Oh, so now you're mad?
The one you sewed last night were too tight.
It's not. You'll make friends, too.
but now everyone is my friend.
That air raid alert is way too late. Watch out for shrapnel.
Air raid all clear!
She lost her husband in the war.
What is it?
Your father will come home safely.
I'll go to Navy training and won't be back for 3 months.
But I might forget your face after 3 months without you.
Thanks.
He's hurt but he'll be discharged soon.
All right. Let's go.
Can we visit the Navy?
Farther than Hiroshima?
The Seto Inland Sea is no longer ours.
We've had series of false alarms.
Cover your ears! Open your mouth!
iWatermelon.i
I held my bag with my left hand.
How could you let this happen?
I'm so sorry, Keiko.
Ignore the siren. They won't come.
Eighth squad, move!
Ready...
A formation is northbound via Hiroshima Bay.
Another northbound via Bungo Channel.
Where can I file a damage report?
Is City Hall still standing?
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Sumi, thanks for coming.
No, so it's strong.
or did that burn down, too?
He's young but very kind.
It'd be great if you came.
It's none of that!
Excuse me...
Here, I've fixed your sister's kimono.
I added rubber straps so you can wear it easily.
My shop was destroyed.
Stop worrying and choose for yourself.
I... changed my mind...
The other stations?
Look at that big cloud. It's an anvil cloud.
Anyone available, please come to the settlement house.
What are these sandals for?
Hiroshima helped us before, now it's our turn to help them.
I said no!
Silly girl. I'll trim your hair when we get home.
I can't face her. I feel so bad.
It should be handed to the authorities.
They'll burn it anyway.
So I gather them to use them as toilet paper.
There's still a tomorrow and the day after that.
Go back home quickly.
Keiko!
Paper waste?
Yes. It was awful.
iSuzu.i
Grandma! Auntie! Chizuko!
What would the story be about?
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
The Navy was disbanded at the end of November.
That's what he told me.
Ouch!
Oh, my. What a lovely young lady you are.
Hey!Up!
Wait for your allowance.
I wonder what we should draw.
Don't want to.
T-Thanks...
Really?
I just got a call.keyframe
Kure?
I hope it all works out for you, sweetie.
Thank you.
You'll answer, I brought a brand new one.
You must answer, Please do.
What? Mizuhara?Makes more sense that this is spoken out loud.
Never met him.
She's much prettier than I am.
So I guess my son took a shine to your daughter on his way to school.
She'll be home any minute.
It's so cold.
I'm Kobayashi, Shusaku's aunt.
Well, you did provide us with the ingredients, Mrs. Urano.
I'll see you around.
The navy's doing searchlight drills.
Yes, I did.
We have. Don't you remember?keyframe
Rationing duty?
Oh, that's Keiko's dress from when she was younger.
It goes in the storage.
Those were the days.
When Shusaku was in the fourth grade,
Mom, listen to this!
Put them together... and sew.
Let's try it!Alt: All right!; That's it!
I'm Harumi Kuromura.
Keiko, Harumi, you're here.
and we brought someone like you to a place you know nothing about.
I'm home.
He's stationed far away.
Suzu might've written down the wrong address too.
How about you?
Yeah?
Come on, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
It might've traveled far to get here.
And that ship is a submarine tender.
Over there.
Look.
The world's greatest warship, born from the Orient's greatest shipyard.
i1Toast and brown some rice.
So I figured I might as well break ties with them.MTBB did good
Shusaku, did you place this here?
Yep. I'm looking at ships.
Ah, there's a lot of ships today.
One of them is the Musashi.
You see that big cloud?
We can go back in the house, now that it's only drizzling.
Wait, was Keiko's husband...
I guess he was way too skinny.
I just need to check on the garden.
i1It took months for me to learn that about her.
What?!
That's espionage!
Suzu involved in espionage, huh?
Sugar's so scarce right now!
i1How will we be able to survive in a country like that?
Oh, isn't it that way?
Thank you so much.
Your accent.
Um...arguably could join this with previous
Not heard of 'em?
i1It's still very hot.
You've got a phone call.
Yes? A phone call for me?
Ah, this is what he wants.
Shusaku, I've brought your notebook.
Oh, Suzu?
Suzu?
I see.
Thanks.
Hup.Alt's: Up I get; Easy does it.
Bath shore leave just means free time.
You. You're so ordinary.normal
Well, I'm turning in for the night.
You know, Shusaku, getting left behind by those who've died...Alt: lagging behind all those who've already bitten the dustbullet... Official: Feeling left behind, alive, while others have already died...
Okay.
Oh, it's no use.
Well...
Yep.
All good, then.
...and was all puzzled about it.
I wanted to thank you for the other day.
I'm the one who forced you to marry me.
Oh yeah?
Really? School isn't scary?
i1No, what on earth am I thinking?
What are you doing?
A light of hope for world peace.
I know you worked all night and it's been warm,sunny
Air raid alert! Air raid alert!
I'm tired of sirens.
From the 15th, I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
Thanks.
No wonder we couldn't find him.
We are all...
Oh, no. What should we do? No time to make it back home.Translating the idea
Oh dear, so they're really coming this time.
Did we miss the train?
Okay.I guess
i1Watermelon.
i1Bracken-starch dumplings.
i1I should've run barefoot.
i1What was over there, anyway?
Don't push yourself.Official: Don't strain yourself.
Be careful.
My house burned down.
Yes. Go ahead.
I'm just glad that you're alive.
i1The right hand that held my brother's brain in February.
i1The right hand that drew...
These are loquats from up on Mt. Eba.
Let me walk you halfway.
The army officer showed it to me when I first arrived.
He's the one who's been giving me meal tickets.
He even remembered that I have an older sister who got married and moved to Kure.MTBB: 'I was able to come today because he remembered that I have a sister who moved to Kure.' I guess the first part here is implied but it's not in JP dialogue itself. Deviates too much from the JP for me.
You like him, huh?
I suppose...
Suzu, come on!
going home to Hiroshima.
The air raids?The air raids are too scary?
Or is it Harumi?
With the doctor.
I can't see my children anymore.
Okay! Okay! Now let me go. It's too hot for that!
Come over here and look at this!
i1Look at that big cloud. It's an anvil cloud.
Suzu, I'm sure your family...
But we couldn't tell who he was.
His face and clothes had melted.
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo.
Stay strong, okay?
I missed all of them.
So, this means...
I tucked this away for our last meal.
I remember that time, yes.
It's just the leftovers of the occupation army.
Paper scraps?
I gave the Americans directions, and they gave me chocolate.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I suppose you must rest easy for now.
Oh, if only I had my hand, I'd draw My Ogre Brother's Adventures in the South Seas.
Leave it.
Oh?
Kure?
To the left is Mt. Hachimaki.
Take a look. We're almost there.
i1Half box, 5 sen.

Too bad he'll miss out on his supper.
an8Quiet!
We...
We brought you watermelon.
Um...
if I leave my kimono, she'll come and take that too?
i1That evening, everything looked faintly mellow.
What?! You left your kimono in Kusatsu?
You can draw for me if that's your fancy.
Hey, you're right, they do look like white rabbits.
I'm done.
Your ma was so shocked
The guy ain't someone you know?
She said I could turn him down if I want to, but I don't even know if I like him or not.See line  13:56 MTTB: She said I could say no if I didn't like him, but how am I meant to know if I don't like him?
Excuse me.MTBB: Pardon us.
i1How did this all happen so quickly?
Oh, hello.
They live on the very corner.
I'll see you around.
Ho-u-jo.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kariya.
Unbelievable.
You and your ways.
Oh, that's Keiko's dress from when she was younger.
She wore that on her dates with her husband.
They'd go to the cinema, fancy restaurants and exhibits.
I'm home.
Welcome back, Keiko.
Put in a waistband and...
What should we do for soup?
O-Ouch...
and we brought someone like you to a place you know nothing about.
Whew! I'm exhausted.
Okay.
Y-Yes!
I think I just accidentally learned some Army secret!
Mommy, can I use the ink?
What did you tell Harumi?
Lend me the ink brush. Please!
Look, some white-eyes are flying about.
The world's greatest warship, born from the Orient's greatest shipyard.
Two thousand...
Ah, I see.
i1Field horsetail.
Oh, so Mrs. Kariya taught you this recipe?
The grains are swollen.
Shusaku, can I have some of this dirt for the fields?
Oh...
Is it...
Good.
Hisao is the heir of the Kuromura family.
I wish we could all smile and live together in peace.
That's the Yamato.MTBB: She's Yamato.
We will not arrest her today, but keep a close eye on her.
Suzu, come with me.keyframe. Start cut looks fine.
It's pretty small, so you won't be able to draw the shoreline.
Suzu, since you love to draw,Alt more literal but unnatural: Suzu-san, since you're one of those people who loves to draw,
Ouch.
But, uh, where?
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
It's that way.
Hey.What would they say in time period? Hiya; howdy ? 'SupWhat's upYo are all too modern
That so?
Huh?
Huh? What's the matter? Don't tell me you really aren't feeling well.
I wanted to take you to the cinema, but...
I guess a big ship is back in port.
Stuff from the past and the paths we didn't choose to walk.
Wow, a real sailor!
That's great.
Well, I'm turning in for the night.
She's a good ship, but yet again she didn't get to triumph or sink in glory.
Okay.
Back in Eba, they just stood in the river year-round.

You sure you don't want me to take you back home?Official: 'Do you want to stay?' What's wrong with the more literal version?
I thought you were forced to get married and needed help.
Makes me wonder what he was like.
i1Our voices can't reach those no longer with us.
Oh yeah?

I'm tired of sirens.
i1Never seen that before.
i1Damage to Hiro Naval Arsenal and Air Arsenal No. 11 was very limited.
I'll go to Navy training and won't be back for three months.
I can't.
But I might forget your face after three months without you.
Let me see. How handsome do I look?Alt: Did you make me handsome?
Huh?
All right. Let's go, Harumi.
Is Shimonoseki far?
You have to stay quiet, okay?
You aren't from around here, are you?
Okay.I guess
You need to evacuate now!keyframe
How could you let this happen?
That it did. Don't you worry.
Are you able to get up, Suzu?keyframe
Are those flares?
My house burned down.
Mind if I use these?
Yes. Go ahead.
I see.
i1I'm glad you're recovering so quickly.
i1I'm glad.
i1The right hand that held my brother's brain in February.
That's right, so it's strong.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Are you trying to die?
Say something!
You don't feel the same?
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you! I can't hear you!
Oh, is that so?!Official: Fine.
Okay, we're off.Alt: Okay then
Oh, right. I guess this isn't going in our wash.
Here.
And please, would you let me stay?
What was that?just now.
i1Look at that big cloud. It's an anvil cloud.
Thank you.
And also Morita Ito, Marina, and Chizuko from Kusatsu.
Please let me stay.
Scrounging up whatever we can to survive. That's our battle.
Oh, please come in.
I tucked this away for our last meal.
i1October, November and next year.
i1A year later, ten years later.
Where's Shusaku?
I'll be transferred to Ootake.
I'll be back! I'll come home to you, got it?
This city sure has changed.Alt: But talk about a changed city. MTBB: Look at this city now.
I gave the Americans directions, and they gave me chocolate.
i1Harumi. I can see the ship now.
Suzu!
Oh, Suzu! You cut your hair.
Oh, my regret knows no bounds.
I can't help with work outside on this day of bitter cold.
You're back safe and sound.
We could leave Kure and start over here.More literally: We could leave home and start a family here.
To the left is Mt. Hachimaki.
That's where our home is.More literally: "Our home's on the foothills of that mountain." Obviously doesn't sound natural
I'll start the fire.for the bath
He's a kidnapper and we're being kidnapped.
What?!
Oh, me too, me too.
Too bad he'll miss out on his supper.
i1The waves were wild just last night,
an8Can't say it's all rosy.
She'll come and eat it later.
You're such a sweet child, Suzu-chan.
Oh.
Best be sure not to lose this one, too.
You may leave when you hand your art in.Alt more literal: You may leave after you've handed yours in.
I wonder what we should draw.
Yeah...
Impressive as always, Urano.
I won't draw it.
I'm ready!
Really?
That's just one village over.Furue is just next door from Kusatsu.
I just got a call.keyframe
I hope it all works out for you, sweetie.
I wouldn't say that.
She'll be home any minute.
Here you go.
She said I could turn him down if I want to, but I don't even know if I like him or not.See line  13:56 MTTB: She said I could say no if I didn't like him, but how am I meant to know if I don't like him?
We lost our way.
They said a strange woman in the woods showed them the way.
I'll be your matchmaker for today.
you can relax a little bit and have her take over.
I have a bad leg,
i1Where have I ended up?
Yes, I did.
It's brand new.
Um, have we met before?
Houjo-san?
This one and this one
I'm just measuring it.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's Keiko's dress from when she was younger.
an8Then sew one, right now!
Uh, so at the waist...
Yes, to get rations.
Um, Onee-san...
That'd be for the best.
That's quite a pile.
Yes.
I was puzzled at first.
Oh my!
Come on, please!
Yes. For tonight's supper.
Oh, here's a yellow one.
You're homesick, huh?
Yes.
There's nothing on the radio.
Yes.
That's terrible.
The pillars and tatami mats from Nee-chan's house were a godsend.
Oh, so this is where you've been.
I'm amazed. You know so much.
Um...
Me too.
I just need to check on the garden.Alt: I'm just going to check on the garden.
She was sketching shorelines and ships.
She may look innocent, but who knows what nefarious plots she's scheming!
Oh, Shusaku, it's just that
the military police investigated Suzu-san, and...
Suzu-san involved in espionage, huh?
Me too...
i1We thought the war would hit home soon when all the air raids happened in June...
We need to hide it from the ants.
Here, take this. Buy some at the black market.
i1It's like summer breaks before the war.
Huh?! That's fifty times the ration price!
i1A box of caramel could cost more than 100 yen.
i1Where the heck am I?
I had watermelon at my grandma's place every summer.
You're pale as a ghost. Are you okay?
Sailors do need their time off. hand over; surrender to. Translating the idea otherwise this line makes little sense.
We'll just have to go another day.
Just say hi like you normally would.
You ain't Urano no more.
Oh, I think it's in the shelter.MTBB: 'In the shelter, if I remember right.' It's ok but a bit unnatural
Good night.
Ahh, there's nothing like being on dry land.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you sleep under this roof.keyframe
Here. A souvenir for ya.
It looked like a heron, but I was way down south when I came across her.Alt: I took it from a heron, even though I was in the southern seas when I saw it.
Suzu, you're awful warm.keyframe. Snapping actually looks worse here even though it doesn't stop short of the dialogue.
Suzu, you're awful soft,
love him, don't you?Official: You love him.
I'm sorry.
You sure you don't want me to take you back home?Official: 'Do you want to stay?' What's wrong with the more literal version?
i1It snowed a lot that winter.
an2going on forever.
i1No, what on earth am I thinking?
but how could you fall asleep in the middle of a bombing?literally: air raid. Bombing does sound more natural here
It's still raw...!
Put out the fire!More literally: 'Put out the fire. Check.'
i1Air raid all clear!
I'm home.
Good. You're safe, Shusaku.
You're so small, Suzu-san.
My military uniform arrived.
From the 15th, I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
I think so.
That's why I'll wait for you right here.house
Will you remember me now?
It's a good chance to visit the Kuromura family back in Shimonoseki tomorrow.
Huh?
I'll get ready.
The hands of girls
This will take forever.Argh
I've been unconscious.
Uh-huh. And who's this?
Bad timing, huh?
Excuse me. Can we have some water?
i1What was over there, anyway?
She's not herself right now.
i1That wooden fence should've had some gaps.
Eighth squad, move!
Onee-san, do you...
i1The right hand that drew my hometown last February.
I need to exercise.
It's still there.
He's young but very kind.
I suppose...
Maybe I will if your officer friend turns out to be quite the handsome one.Alt more literally: It all depends on whether your officer friend is handsome or not.
Ow, that's hot!
Or is it Harumi?
Say something!
Suzu-san, I really enjoyed these 18 months we spent together.year and a half
My word. What a hot morning.
So? When's your appointment?
Oh, right. I guess this isn't going in our wash.
I'm sorry I blamed you for Harumi's death.
I did!
Could it be lightning in this weather?
I doubt anyone around here has.
Uh-huh.
My husband has business in Hiroshima soon.
But...
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo-san.
Thank you.
They're just going to burn them, anyway.
That's true enough.
But we can't let people use our toilet for a while, then.
I've still have my left arm and both my legs!left hand. MTBB: I've still got one working arm and two working legs!
I'll be back! I'll come home to you, got it?
That's true enough.
No flavor to be found up here.
Oh, dear.Is she reacting to her being sleepy or seeing all the lice? I can't really tell since her expression is much the same after the dad notices.
what's that thing?
What?!
That's no good.
You'll see soon enough.
We...
i1But it's not all bad, being young.
Come on. The tide is pulling out.keyframe
Suzu, put it lower. The wind could blow it away.
Sumi, let's trade pencils.
You're cold!
I'm home.
He's got plenty more.
The sea was like this back at New Year's, when the ferry capsized.
he's better than the idiot who joined the Navy and drowned.
I'm done.
Now I have to go home.
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
That's far!
You're going far away to get married, Suzu.neechan. Maybe: Cousin Suzu ?
Suzu, you need to go straight home!
I want you to have this. I fixed it up for the day you get married.
You dimwit!Official: Don't be silly! See lines  1:03:14, 1:08:25, 1:21:03
We lost the seaweed business to land reclamation three years ago.
It's so cold.
Yeah...
Definitely lacking in many ways. Are you really going to be okay?Alt: That's a worry. Onscreen time!
i1Let's see... who was that?
you can relax a little bit and have her take over.
What's wrong? Is yours not ripe?
I'm just glad you've got a mouth that works.Alt more literally: I'm just glad you can eat properly with your mouth.
There you go again!Official: Stop that!
Haha, I'm young, don't worry!? not sure about this interjection but can't think of anything better
They'd go to the cinema, fancy restaurants and exhibits.
She was a real modern lady, wasn't she?
an8Then sew one, right now!
Mom, listen to this!
I'm done!
Suzu, are you going to town?
Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
Stop. I'll do it.
Hey, Mom!
That's quite a pile.
Then my in-laws apologized for not letting me come visit sooner.Alt: the in-laws
I haven't heard from him, though.
Suzu might've written down the wrong address, too.
What? You're leaving, too?
Sure.
Okay then, thank you for your time.
Lend me the ink brush. Please!
What?
Is that a ship?
About 2,700 people.
That's right. Let's welcome them to Kure, Suzu.
i1Four dried sardines for three meals for a family of four.
Don't worry. I'll find myself a job and start working.go to work; get working
Things are getting rough.Official: Things are getting more precarious.
Okay, let's clean up out here.
Ah, there's a lot of ships today.
I see two Yamato ships.
Oh, thanks.
You really like your battleships, huh?
this Hisao here?lead in works ok since it's a connected sentence.
Wait, was Keiko's husband...
Does she have a random number table?
I don't know if I can draw you well...
I'm okay.
I was just looking at the ants.
We need to hide it from the ants.
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
Oh, isn't it that way?
Even though you're grown up?
Are you also from South Hiroshima?
I am. But how did you...?
I had watermelon at my grandma's place every summer.
What took you so long?
Well, let's go have a cold beer.
You're pale as a ghost. Are you okay?
They're like dreams we woke up from.
I'll go ask for you.
Thanks.
Wow, you're tanned even though it's winter.
so I thought to call on Suzu, a friend from back home.
Don't by shy, now. Just say the word and I'll take her right back home!MTBB did good
You ain't Urano no more.
Hey! Suzu, wanna join me?
I asked him to sleep in the shed.
Come on, we have lots to catch up on.
Yep.
Right?keyframe
Wait, don't tell me...Literally: possibly; could it be
was actually you.
Yep.
You still get angry and sorry about ordinary things.
I wanted to thank you for the other day.
It's nothing.
But Shusaku,
Oh yeah?
Why'd you have to wear the socks with holes today?!
but now I'm the best of friends with everyone!
Well, uh...
We strive to improve our skills.
Remove sliding doors!
I can't see anything.
Suzu, it's boiling over.
I love you.This is the dub and is a much better translation. I think the strong dialect made the official sub translators change it to: 'I'm so fond of you.'
Shusaku, I'll walk you halfway.
What about school?
Way farther.
I've picked up bits and pieces of news, lying here.
and there are rumors that we'll be merged with the Army.Literally: there are rumors of the Navy being absorbedtaken over
Suzu, did you know that the Yamato sunk?
So that's why Keiko was...Was italicised, but Suzu being a bit of airhead was clearing thinking out loud even if Harumi was right there
Hey Suzu, can we go that way?MTBB: Suzu, can we look over thataway?
Hmm, I wonder if we can see anything.
We can't see anything.
Suzu, I'm scared.
Did we miss the train?
Maybe the train is waiting for people.
Are you all right?
Yes!Official: "We're fine!" I'm going with she can't quite hear them properly so a standard Yes works.
Hey Suzu?
Will you draw my brother sometime?
i1Mint candy.
Murderer.
She didn't mean what she said.
i1Right?
This house made it through, huh?
Hurry, Suzu! Come on!keyframe
Eighth squad, move!
i1Hang on, people of Kure!
I'm beat. It's so, so hot.
Canceled.
i1I'm glad.
i1The right hand that held Harumi's hand in June.
Wow!
It's still there.
The army officer showed it to me when I first arrived.
He's young but very kind.
You like him, huh?
Ouch.
See you soon!later
i1I'm the one that's gone all wrong.
Over the mountain, to Hiroshima!
For good?MTBB translating the idea is better. More literally: You're not going to come backreturn?
Great timing.
'Kay.
Excuse me, um...
Thank you very much.
Okay! Okay! Now let me go. It's too hot for that!
i1This is Okayama Broadcasting. Hiroshima, do you read me?
Is this how you do it?
Oh, it's so frustrating with one hand.Argh looks a bit stupid but 'Oh' still isn't quite right.
so now it's our turn to..."While Kure was being bombed" is not natural for a local.
My husband has business in Hiroshima soon.
The navy base sent a relief party.
Okay.
And also Ito, Marina, and Chizuko Morita from Kusatsu.
Thank you.
i1All the reasons why we endured it all.
Yes!
Didn't you hear?
Oh, Suzu! You cut your hair.
Don't get up. Are you ill?
Oh, no.
Will I get better?
Suzu.
And please, never leave, and always be by my side.
I'm worried about Hiroshima, but Kure is the town I've chosen to belong to.
Oh, dear.Is she reacting to her being sleepy or seeing all the lice? I can't really tell since her expression is much the same after the dad notices.
what's that thing?
Ouch!
Let's have a look-see.keyframe
Thanks, Urano Suzu!
We...
Oh, my. What a lovely young lady you are.
an8Can't say it's all rosy.
i1That's how my brother explained it to me later.
No.
You're cold!
I hope it'll last the week.
Today's art class is free drawing time.
Yeah...
Mmm. Very nice.
I wish I could draw like you, Suzu.
I'm home.
Huh?
Mizuhara, you can have my brother if you want.
And with a drawing like this,
My.
You're going far away to get married, Suzu.neechan. Maybe: Cousin Suzu ?
Where did you come from, Grandma?
I just got a call.keyframe
Kure?
On your wedding night, he'll ask, Did you bring an umbrella?
Then he will ask, Can I open it?
B-But why?
Because you must.
Your ma was so shocked
Oh, gosh!
She said I could turn him down if I want to, but I don't even know if I like him or not.See line  13:56 MTTB: She said I could say no if I didn't like him, but how am I meant to know if I don't like him?
Excuse me.MTBB: Pardon us.
Oh, Mrs. Kobayashi.
I'll be your matchmaker for today.
Definitely lacking in many ways. Are you really going to be okay?Alt: That's a worry. Onscreen time!
Here we are.
I'll see you then!
Thank you for setting the futon.
Mrs. Houjo?
It not unfair!
I'm home.
Welcome back, Keiko.
What brings you home, Keiko?
You'll never get married if you can't do it right.
Yes, to get rations.
I'll go instead.
What is it, dear?
It would've been better if I just stayed here all along.
Welcome home.
My sister-in-law said I could go back to Hiroshima.
I was puzzled at first.
I haven't heard from him, though.
How about you?
No, I'm not.
Look, over there.
Maybe it's the Hiyo and the Junyo.
There's a U-boat from Germany.
i1But by then, rationing had gotten much worse.
i1It's still better then just being given vegetable leafs,
We have lots of rice today.
The grains are swollen.
I've never seen rice cooked this way.
No need to run to the mountains yet.
They need to build firebreaks throughout the city.
Huh?!
Don't worry. I'll find myself a job and start working.go to work; get working
Yeah?
What?
It's nice that you get along.
Wait, was Keiko's husband...
I don't know if I can draw you well...
Ouch.
I was just looking at the ants.
I had watermelon at my grandma's place every summer.
Rin!
Sorry, I have to go.
i1It's still very hot.
That so?
But you've been so kind to me.
They're like dreams we woke up from.
i1Eating for only one after all.
I'll go ask for you.
Thanks.
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, an Aoba crewmember.
I had nowhere else to go,
Thank you all for takin such good care of Suzu.
Don't by shy, now. Just say the word and I'll take her right back home!MTBB did good
Here.
Well, I'm turning in for the night.
was actually you.
and sweet.
You finally being here.
You still get angry and sorry about ordinary things.
They were just ordinary choices,
i1Our voices can't reach those no longer with us.
It's nothing.
Don't worry. No teacher will scold a well-behaved child like you.since it's not a proper noun 'teacher' is best
So, what about the enemies horsepower...?I guess enemy is what a young child would say.
Ready air raid gear!
Remove sliding doors!
It's still raw...
And now her 17-year-old is being drafted.
Put out the fire!More literally: 'Put out the fire. Check.'
i1Air raid all clear!
Good. You're safe, Shusaku.
Not home... yet.
Oh.I see.
What?
From the 15th, I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
No, with you, it's possible.you never know
Your uniform looks so cool!
No wonder we couldn't find him.
What about school?
Aw...
And use a bamboo spear for what?Alt; And anyway, what am I goingsupposed to do with a bamboo spear; And anyway, what do you expect me to do with a bamboo spear.
Way farther.
We're gonna ride the train and see my brother.
Hmm, I wonder if we can see anything.
Oh dear, so they're really coming this time.
We'll be okay.
Uh-huh. And who's this?
i1She warned me so many times, but somehow I was okay.
i1If only I had it the other way around.
i1What was over there, anyway?
I'm so sorry, Harumi.
Stop, Keiko.
i1Her house was completely destroyed.
Be safe.keyframe
Oh, good. The sun's out.
Are those flares?
Okay. Let's do it.
i1Hang on, people of Kure!
Oh, here. Eat up while it's still warm.
Hey! Anyone here from Shinonome?
Your training?
i1The right hand that cooked Lord Kusunoki's rice.
That's near the turret by the river.
Oh please, Suzu!Stop that!
i1Don't come here.
Over the mountain, to Hiroshima!
going home to Hiroshima.
For good?MTBB translating the idea is better. More literally: You're not going to come backreturn?
Tell me why, then!
I can't hear you.
I can't hear anything!Add: "here!"
Do as you please!
Take care.
Oh, about 10 o'clock.
It's okay.
But my choices have led me here.
You're welcome to stay here or go anywhere you choose.
What was that?just now.
The wounded must stay.
My hair's no longer in the way. So take me, please.This is the official trnaslation. It translates the idea and sounds more natural than the more literal alt: Now no one needs to worry abouttake timewaste time tying up my hair. Take me, please.
Oh no.
He walked all the way from Hiroshima.
His face and clothes had melted.
Harumi.
i1Forever and ever.
We only have rice.Alt: There's nothing else though.
I suppose it's the legal office's job to maintain order in times like this.Ministry's job?
No more bombs so no more floating fish.
an2So delicious!
The dead soldier found next to the settlement house was my son.
Oh, if only I had my hand, I'd draw My Ogre Brother's Adventures in the South Seas.
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.
Suzu.
You're back safe and sound.
Suzu, this is the bridge where I first met you.
We'll keep changing and growing, this city and us.
Kure?
That's right. This is Kure.
an8Yeah! Just like that!
an8Business is still busy.
He's a kidnapper and we're being kidnapped.
Too bad he'll miss out on his supper.
Thanks, Urano Suzu!
i1And so I forgot how scary my ogre brother could be.
Wait for your allowance.
an2So short!
Yeah...
Impressive as always, Urano.
I wish I could draw like you, Suzu-chan.
Huh?
He's got plenty more.
Huh?
No thanks.
Hey, you're right, they do look like white rabbits.
Now I have to go home.
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
You're going far away to get married, Suzu-neechan.neechan. Maybe: Cousin Suzu ?
Suzu-chan, you need to go straight home!
Nineteen. Well, actually, eighteen.
I want you to have this. I fixed it up for the day you get married.
I hope it all works out for you, sweetie.
Never met him.
Oh, Kobayashi-san.
They live on the very corner.
Simple is best for my daughter.
Don't disrobe here!
Well, you did provide us with the ingredients, Urano-san.
I'm glad. He seems the quiet sort.
Oh, right! She's my sister-in-law who's already married!Official: 'Right! She's the daughter who got married.' Arguably more natural but the more literal sounds fine
Excuse me...
Oh, of course!
Rationing duty?
This one and this one
I'm Chita.
Haha, I'm young, don't worry!? not sure about this interjection but can't think of anything better
Oops!
Are you roasting beans?
So I stay quiet.
Not again! Another mistake.Alt: There you go again! That's all wrong. See lines  1:26:08  keyframe
Are you sure? Thank you.Alt: You will?
and we brought someone like you to a place you know nothing about.
Suzu-san, why don't you go home to Hiroshima?
Yes.
Then my in-laws apologized for not letting me come visit sooner.Alt: the in-laws
He's stationed far away.
Don't I smell like machine oil?
i1Dad gave me an allowance.
Leave her be. She's still just a child.girl
Yes.
So you noticed.
Please, let me borrow the ink brush?
Aw...
i1Add triple the normal amount of water and gently simmer the rice.
They're tearing houses down, now.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for helping us.
Really?
It causes heavy rain.
You'll meet him one day.
Yeah.
i1I can't believe I'm here, doing this with him.
They used to measure their heights together as one happy family.
T-The military police?
She was sketching shorelines and ships.
She may look innocent, but who knows what nefarious plots she's scheming!
I'm home.
What's going on? The laundry is still outside.
i1We thought the war would hit home soon when all the air raids happened in June...
Ouch.
W-What's wrong?She's making toilet paper I think.
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
i1Where the heck am I?
Oh, that's Nagasako.
Caramel?
Yeah, from Kusatsu.
We were poor, so I always ate the rinds people left behind.
But anyway, you sure can draw.
If there's anything else you want me to draw, just tell me.'me to draw' not in JP. It could be omitted but it might not really make sense. Official: 'I'll draw whatever you want.'
Hey.What would they say in time period? Hiya; howdy ? 'SupWhat's upYo are all too modern
What took you so long?
We've still got time. Let's take a walk.
Oh, Suzu-san?
D-Do I really look that funny?
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, an Aoba crewmember.
Isn't Aoba a Class A cruiser?
Mind your manners, Harumi.
I had nowhere else to go,
Don't by shy, now. Just say the word and I'll take her right back home!MTBB did good
Stop being so cocky!smug
That's great.
Upsy-daisy.
Thank you.
Mizuhara-san, with my father away on duty, I'm the head of this family.
Here. I tossed some coals in the bed warmer. Take it to him.Official: I've readied the bed warmer. Take it to him.
Come on, we have lots to catch up on.
Really?
was actually you.
Suzu, you're awful soft,
You sure you don't want me to take you back home?Official: 'Do you want to stay?' What's wrong with the more literal version?
I thought you were forced to get married and needed help.
but somewhere along the way, I guess my life derailed from the ordinary.
Is this Onii-chan's brain?Yoichi's
i1It snowed a lot that winter.
W-Whose cat is that?!Alt: Where'd this cat come from?!
i1Never seen that before.
Oh.I see.

We came from Naganoki to visit the hospital.
Excuse me. Can we have some water?
i1Rin-san?i0
Ignore the siren. They won't come.Sleep, sleep

Okay.
You had me worried. You dummy.

Haha, I'm young, don't worry!? not sure about this interjection but can't think of anything better
Ouch...
I must point out that the probability is extremely high.Could add: the probability of air raids... Not in the JP but implied. This is kind of cutting into his speech midway so he was probably talking about air raids just prior.
Oh, that's Keiko's dress from when she was younger.
She wore that on her dates with her husband.
Welcome back, Onee-san.Keiko-san seems most logical. Not very consistent but when 
I'm done!

Come on, Suzu! Wake up already.

What? How do you know my name?
Hey! Keep it down!
i1but now it's all gone with the spring tide.
an8How's life over in Eba?
i1That's how my brother explained it to me later.
Wait for your allowance.
I wish I could draw like you, Suzu.
Even if it's just this boring ocean.keyframe. If not for the needed onscreen time this is better snapped.
The white waves look like rabbits hopping.
Kure?
Right.
Huh?
Never met him.
Okay.
Here you go.
Which way is the station?
They're here!
Don't disrobe here!
Yes?
I'm Chita.
There you go again!Official: Stop that!
You're eyeballing it!
Are you roasting beans?
My, if it isn't Harumi. Welcome, dear.
an8Then sew one, right now!
Yes, to get rations.
But it's not as cold as harvesting seaweed, so there are good things about it.
Suzu?
Yeah?
What? You're leaving, too?
What for?
It might've traveled far to get here.
No, I'm not.
Maybe it's the Hiyo and the Junyo.
And that ship is a submarine tender.
i1Mix them with the sweet potatoes and some flour, and roll into flat disks.
i1Toast and brown some rice.
i1Add miso and violets to yesterday's sardine stew.
We have lots of rice today.
There's nothing on the radio.
It's only a blackout.
Oh, thank you.
Things are getting rough.Official: Things are getting more precarious.
Yeah.
You'll meet him one day.
Um...
Isn't that nice? Two married couples getting along so well.Alt: getting along so splendidly.
I guess he was way too skinny.
Me too.
That's espionage!
Oh, Shusaku, it's just that
I don't understand, but it sounds funny!
I was just looking at the ants.
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
Oops, I'm sorry.
Where did you come from?
Um...arguably could join this with previous
That's...
Talking about desserts for the first time in ages, somehow makes even water taste sweet.Alt: 'All this talk about desserts has made even this water taste sweet.' I like this but it isn't quite what she's saying, she is talking in general, not just "this water" or in this instance. I guess it's still acceptable, though. The simple, official version: 'Thinking about desserts makes water taste sweet.'
i1It's still very hot.
Oh, Suzu?
Well then, let's go.
I don't want you seeing this silly grin on my face!
What if I bump into him?MTBB: I don't know what I'll do if I see him.
Just say hi like you normally would.
I'm Tetsu Mizuhara, an Aoba crewmember.
Mind your manners, Harumi.
I'm sorry about the room.
It looked like a heron, but I was way down south when I came across her.Alt: I took it from a heron, even though I was in the southern seas when I saw it.
Back in Eba, they just stood in the river year-round.
Oh, it's no use.
No...
Our family was poor, so he went off to a tuition-free naval academy.
And when my brother died, I signed up to join the Navy.
Suzu.
But why did they send us a single rock instead of his bones.
It was so tiny that Sumi thought...
I'm the one who forced you to marry me.
Hey, you two, do you really need to fight right now?
Ouch!
I know you worked all night and it's been warm,sunny
Remove sliding doors!
I can't see anything.
W-Whose cat is that?!Alt: Where'd this cat come from?!
From the 15th, I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
I think so.
But you'll be okay, Suzu.
I can't.
Suzu...
Well, I'm off.
What about school?
Don't worry.
can also work for our country.
And use a bamboo spear for what?Alt; And anyway, what am I goingsupposed to do with a bamboo spear; And anyway, what do you expect me to do with a bamboo spear.
The Seto Inland Sea is no longer ours.
That's why I told Keiko...Added her name to make it clearer. Alt: "her"
I want to see what ships are here so I can tell my brother.
Excuse me, could you let us in?
Suzu, I'm scared.
We came from Naganoki to visit the hospital.
Maybe the train is waiting for people.
Hey Suzu?
i1She warned me so many times, but somehow I was okay.
i1Bracken-starch dumplings.
You killed her!
We're glad that we got you back alive, at least.
Well, if it gets too tiring at work, I'll just take a break there.
I'm okay.

I see.
I'm just glad that you're alive.
i1The hand that loved to make nori.
Your sister is here!little sister
Wow!
The army officer showed it to me when I first arrived.
Ouch.
Suzu, I really enjoyed these 18 months we spent together.year and a half
I loved walking with you and listening to you talk.
You don't feel the same?
'Kay.
Isn't your hometown's festival today?
Sorry.Official: Whoops
Okay! Okay! Now let me go. It's too hot for that!
The other stations?
I picked some eucalyptus leaves.
Ah, this rubbish again.Idea translation. Literally: so loud
You had me worried. You dummy.
We lost the war?
Why?
This city sure has changed.Alt: But talk about a changed city. MTBB: Look at this city now.
It's all right.
Thank heavens for the salty seas!
He grows a beard and marries a crocodile.
On the morning of the festival, Mom went shopping in the city.
I'll find that beauty mark and know it's you right away.MTBB: That beauty mark is a dead giveaway.
And in the center is Mt. Haigamine.
an8Yeah! Just like that!
A monster.
That's no good.
i1Mom and Dad joined us after shopping, and we visited our family grave.
an8There's word of a new shipyard.
an8Is that so?
i1I think it lets you see different things.
Would you like some more?
Hey, you too, Sumi.
She'll come and eat it later.
i1That evening, everything looked faintly mellow.
What?! You left your kimono in Kusatsu?
'Kay.
Oh, Mom, can you give me two sen?
No.
You may leave when you hand your art in.Alt more literal: You may leave after you've handed yours in.
Mmm. Very nice.
My folks quit workin with seaweed and picked up drinking instead.
I won't draw it.
You can draw for me if that's your fancy.
All the guys say you should run when you see your brother.Official: Everyone says, Run when you see Urano's brother.
he's better than the idiot who joined the Navy and drowned.
You shouldn't have bothered.
Really?
i1I guess I'm becoming an adult.
It's so cold.
She said I could turn him down if I want to, but I don't even know if I like him or not.See line  13:56 MTTB: She said I could say no if I didn't like him, but how am I meant to know if I don't like him?
They said a strange woman in the woods showed them the way.
Yeah...
Our deepest apologies.
Oh, hello.
Suzu, no!Hey, Suzu!  Oy Suzu!
This is quite the feast!
Would you just look at all this!
This stew is delicious.
We have. Don't you remember?keyframe
I also remember that beauty mark of yours.
Oh, of course!
We're off.
Rationing duty?
are always going at it.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kariya.
When Shusaku was in the fourth grade,
We thought those times were tough.
What brings you home, Keiko?
Ah, I see.
Let's try it!Alt: All right!; That's it!
Oops.Realising she needs to collect the daily food rations
Hey, Mom!
What should we do for soup?
It must be a dangerous job.
But it's not as cold as harvesting seaweed, so there are good things about it.
How about you?
What?
Come on, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
All the dandelions here are white, aren't they?
Maybe it's the Hiyo and the Junyo.
That's right. Let's welcome them to Kure, Suzu.
And do laundry?
Aw...
But I'll do even better tomorrow.
All right! Let's eat.
Well, I don't think we need to worry about that here.
I hope they can find a place to live.
Yeah.
What?
We can go back in the house, now that it's only drizzling.
They used to measure their heights together as one happy family.
And that's Tone.
We will not arrest her today, but keep a close eye on her.
Suzu, since you love to draw,Alt more literal but unnatural: Suzu-san, since you're one of those people who loves to draw,
We had to appear apologetic to those MPs.Official: 'We couldn't be rude to the MPs.' MTBB: 'We had to lower our eyes in front of the officers...'
I don't understand, but it sounds funny!
Oh no, no more sugar?double 'no' might not work...
But, uh, where?
Oops, I'm sorry.
For Naganoki, you turn that corner, go down to the post office, and then...
Wait here.
Most of us aren't locals, and we don't go beyond these gates.literally: won't leave Official: Most of us aren't locals and we stay within these gates.
Your accent.
I had watermelon at my grandma's place every summer.
You've got a phone call.
Ahh, it's so hot.
We've still got time. Let's take a walk.
Stuff from the past and the paths we didn't choose to walk.
Don't by shy, now. Just say the word and I'll take her right back home!MTBB did good
You. You're so ordinary.normal

No...
They were just ordinary choices,
They called us up in the cold for a stupid rock?rock not in JP but better included. Edited version of MTBB

Ouch!

Bad timing, huh?
Will you draw my brother sometime?

How could you let this happen?
I'm so sorry, Harumi.
You killed her!
Give her back!
We're glad that we got you back alive, at least.
i1That wooden fence should've had some gaps.
This house made it through, huh?
Be careful.
You're hurt.
Thank you.
You sure you're okay?
I need to exercise.
Let me walk you halfway.
He's the one who's been giving me meal tickets.
Oh please, Suzu!Stop that!
See you soon!later
That's right! Fly as far away as you can!That way!

I loved walking with you and listening to you talk.
I can't hear anything!Add: "here!"
Do as you please!
Take care.
Here.
They'll probably have to write you a referral to somewhere in Hiroshima, too.
I'm sorry I blamed you for Harumi's death.
The man I loved died young.
You just did what you were told.
You're welcome to stay here or go anywhere you choose.
can you wash this, please?
And please, would you let me stay?
i1This is Okayama Broadcasting. Hiroshima, do you read me?
Yes, but I've never made sandals.
Send 'em to Hiroshima.
My husband has business in Hiroshima soon.
Oh no.
Mom!
But...
He died sitting here?keyframe
And by the way, Urano Juro, Kiseno and Sumi are from Eba.
Please let me stay.
I'm sorry.
Let's enjoy white rice tonight.
We still have tomorrow and the day after that.
Not to worry.
Thank you. Here is fine.
Go back home quickly.
Didn't you hear?
And you lost Harumi right in front of your eyes.
Oh, no.
Sachiko?
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
Shusaku, thank you for finding me in this corner of the world.
She's covered in lice!
Thank you for the training!Nozomi: "Thank you in advance for your guidance!" SallySubs: "Thank you for doing this with me."
And people such as ourselves, who give guided tours around the city on gondolas, are known as Undines.
A miracle, huh?
A present...
It didn't occur to me at all.SallySubs: I totally forgot.
I see.
Thank you for waiting. This is Aria Company.
there's a company workshop I have to attend tonight, so I'd better make my way back.
And now we're known as the Three Great Water Fairies.
What am I, a little girl?
Catch, Alicia!
I hope you enjoyed the ride.SallySubs: And here we are.
Ahh, that made my day!Literally: "satisfied" but you wouldn't say this.
You got it!
Right, President Aria?
No, no! Stop getting so happy over something like that!
I don't remember there being an alley here.
It's not over here. I think we lost it.
an2We know.
So we got curious and looked you up.
I would have shipped her off to Siberia.
Um, look me up, how?
D-Does that sound weird?Alt: Uh, does...
It's not here.SallySubs: Nothing here!
Let's look over there again.
Um...
Well, then...
So, I can't ever see Cait Sith again?
I'm so happy!
The miracle you were given today was a sparkling encounter too, wasn't it?
Yes!
Are you all right, President Aria?
Now, got to practice, got to practice!SallySubs: Better get practicing! Nozomi: Now, practice, practice!
It's a city where wondrous encounters can happen from time to time.
Yep, and that's called your astral birthday.
And that's why you came all this way to give her a present!
After that, she'll be free until athe Gondola Association meeting at 6 o'clock.
On your training?
And now we're known as the Three Great Water Fairies.
I'm not sure why,
Oh, so pathetic!
Akira-san...
That was a miracle! It's incredible, Akira-san!
You're way too dramatic, Akari-chan.
M-Maybe...
and the smiles on Alicia-san and Athena-san's faces at that moment,
After all, you came to Aqua, a planet that's full of miracles!
Meeting someone you've been longing to see...
Or hearing someones voice you've been longing to hear...
Akari-san!
an2Thank you very much!
Hi there!
Thank you very much!
I have a feeling it's going to be a wonderful day today.
It's not over here. I think we lost it.
I would have shipped her off to Siberia.
And according to the information I got from the Branch Manager,
No way.
that Ai-san's chances of having a wondrously mysterious encounter are almost as high as Akari-san's.
I shall partake in this playful moment with you, then.
Finally, a breather.
We were mostly looking for Cait Sith though.
Yeah, it probably is.
If that's the case, I hope I can see him one last time, even if it's just for the briefest moment.Literally: "glimpse"
Oh, I know about that.
The Stone of Misfortune!
I stepped on it a bunch of times when I was little, but nothing ever happened.
I don't want that!
Yeah, you must be right.Alt: Yeah, you might be onto something.
But I still want to meet Cait Sith someday too.
All right, I've decided.
My, my, President Aria.
And I knew I was contradicting myself.
we need to work hard, so our good luck doesn't go to waste!
Maybe the Acqua Alta is coming soon?
Let's create a miracle!
Create a miracle?
Huh?What?
I'm afraid we'll have to have lunch separately today.
Aika-chan and Alice-chan are both busy until this evening, huh?
Ai-chan seems busy too.
No way, did you girls...?!
Hey!
Well, the rest of us were all able to make it, so that's good.Nozomi: ...make it. Let's be glad.
No sappy lines allowed!
Starting with my encounter with President Aria, things slowly grew over time.
I should let myself grow alongside her, at my beloved Aria Company.
It's a nightshine chime.
What's this?From the actual episode S2E12, I think this was more about wondering why she was crying, but here it's more like a "wow" moment
When you had to say goodbye to that nightshine chime, how did you feel?
But you know what, it was probably a good thing too, Alicia-san.
A love so dear to you, that it stays with you forever.
You can't stand still any longer.
Sometimes, a wish you thought would never come true
It's really a miracle!
Aquamarine...
Now, let's row...
I've always, always admired Undines and dreamed of becoming one.
The rule where Singles can give rides to customers with a Prima Undine on board didn't exist back in the day.
It's the Acqua Alta, President Aria!
I'm going out now.
This place is...
True.
Alicia-san! Grandma!
What a great job, you girls!
Thank you.
they said it was for the benefit of the water guide industry and all Undines.
President Aria.
So, instead of rushing into a decision,
It's a nightshine chime.
As I spent Aqua's passing seasons with you,
I wanted it to stay like that forever.
Alice-chan is graduating from middle school,
which means we need to come to a decision, too.
A dream?
Yes. The seed of a wish, unfulfilled.
A gondola party might be nice, too!
Athena-senpai!
From this day forth, you are a Prima Undine!
Now, let's row...
Now then, it's time to depart for today's practice.
This is Neo-Venezia of the water planet Aqua.
It looks like Alicia-san doesn't have even a single moment to rest.
No! It's just that I was able to take a rare half-day today.
I came to show off and laugh at her sullen expression after she gets jealous of my time off, so...
The meeting afterwards will end late at night, so I'll be heading straight home.
That's all, I can't keep my guest waiting any longer.
Akira-san!
Let's make our way back.
Members of the Association, I am Akira E. Ferrari of Himeya Company.
The smiles of Akira-san, Alicia-san, and Athena-san,
Are you here for conversion? Baptism?
By the way, the woman you came here with
Kazuma...
Even the women and children in this town are pretty advanced.
What's with this town? Do something about your followers already.
Do you have anything else to confess?
Control your people a little!
You get out! You're done confessing, so get out!
Well, please, share it with me!
I accidentally broke it.
What are you saying? What exactly are you saying, Kazuma?
But!
Eris pads her chest!
Are you feeling better?
Well, whatever. Do what you want.
I'm gonna head into the bath.
You seem pretty worn out, though.
This town...
Huh, I guess.
No, thanks!
I wanna go home. I wanna go home already.
Your logic doesn't make sense!
but he never lets social standing bother him,
He's not earnest about anything, but at his core, he's a good person.
It makes sense.
Must suck for you, having such a weird owner, huh?
I just went into the baths!
Come to think of it, she purified the tea into water, too...
so I'd rather not get involved.
Who cares about your dumb walk?!
Wh-What about you, Darkness?
Wiz is soft on you, so maybe she'll help?
Come on, come to me!
Join the faith now and you are guaranteed one!
Soap, detergent, soap, detergent, soap, detergent,
Kazuma-san!
What were you doing out here?
Well, actually
Huh? Wasn't he just...
Oh, my.
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
The Devil King's army is currently plotting sabotage against this town!
As for what exactly they're doing, they've put poison in the town's hot springs!
Until this case is solved, please don't use the hot springs!
If you tell people not to go into our number one attraction, the hot springs,
You were trying to trick us, eh?!
Honored followers of the Axis faith,
because you have blue hair and eyes, you'll be cursed!
here to bankrupt our hot spring city, aren't you?!
But I'm the goddess of this town...
But if I don't do anything, my dear followers will...
What's going on?
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
That makes sense.
pretty attractive, in a way!
And that blue hairaren't you the one who pulled that prank where you
Hey, don't push me! What are you trying to do?!
Milady, stop resisting!
So easy.
Let's hurry!
Where do you think you're going, Hans?!
a6Oh, okay.
You jerks keep using my name with no respect!
Even though the harder I work, the less money I seem to have...
Wiz, isn't the deal that you don't help us, apart from maintaining the barrier,
It's probably hard for you to take him on, so you can stay back.
First of all, physical attacks have nearly no effect on them.
What the heck?! Scary!
Isn't that a good thing?
Are you sure about this? Things are just going to get worse, at this rate.
Whatever it is, once I finish with these hot springs, I'll be done with this town.
The condition for my neutrality
Since they receive that payment,
But the nice old man who oversaw these hot springs didn't do anything wrong!
Did he melt your brain?!
But I can't! If I don't protect the hot springs, my faithful...
a6What's up?
Did that beast eat him?!
Thank goodness I was able to stop Hans before I ran out of magic power...
"The Axis Church can get things done.
Eris pads her chest!
ultimately ended up being accomplished.
Come on! Come over here!
Hey, look!
Look over there!
I can see Axel!
Nah, I must be imagining things.
Welcome home, everyone!
You were out here waiting every day, weren't you?
an8i1begins once again!
an8I wanna go home.
You're the one who went along with it and washed my back!
an8Yep!
Wait, hang on...
If...
Wait. Th-That's right.
It was my command!
Meat
It might be hard, but suck it up!
Hey, they haven't sentenced me to prison yet!
The whole guild's got my back!
Well, see you in front of the prison!
I had them wear masks today. No one'll figure it out this time.
More importantly, I waited all night for you. Why didn't you escape?lol quality shot here
an8Weren't you wandering around yesterday too?
Out!
i1They sure don't pull any punches.
Where are you from, and what did you do there?
an easy way to make a lot of money,
I've said this a million times! I made that call to save the town!
I'm sorry, we don't have anything like that.
Don't the prosecutors here even know how to serve tea?!
Worry not, Kazuma.
Hey, hey, that guy's staring at us. seems to have his eyes glued to us.
Chris!
That's right, he threatened us!
He said he was an advocate of true gender equality,
But the most compelling evidence
All right! Keep your eyes on that thing and listen to me!
Darkness?
I always knew that gal was hiding something big.
I do not request a dismissal of the case.
This trial's a load of crap!
I will trust your judgment.
Darkness...
This man lacks the guts for such an act.
I was the one who did it!
Excuse me? I was told you were trying to act as a meatshield.
If only one of us has to take the fall here, that's for the best!
We'll just wait until Kazuma finishes doing his time!
Er, um...
What are you doing here?!
I came to save you, obviously!
After that, you can use your Stealth skill to escape the jail!
Very astute of you!
Where are you from, and what did you do there?
Did you have a grudge against the lord?
The reward I received for the dullahan hunt
Honestly, taking rumors at face value like that!
But what, exactly?!
That is the lord in question, Aldarp.
Prosecutor, step forward!
What a deviant.
I will admit that Kazuma has a warped personality,
The basis for the case? Very well.
First!
Even if it was to defeat a dullahan, he damaged the town with a flood.
My defense is doomed.
The defendant... is guilty.
They're said to be the king's greatest allies! They're famous!
I am not asking for it to be canceled.
I don't care how much authority the Dustiness family wields...
This trial's a load of crap!
that the suspect's personal assets be seized to pay back his debt!
a6Mom, Dad, it's been a while.
a6I'm currently in a really tough position.
a6I'm facing a lot of questions about my choices as an adventurer, and as a huma
What's with the cat?
You want to keep her?
She's Chomusuke.
Listen up. When she gets back,
Thanks to that, the Giant Toads that had been hibernating woke up early.
The toads haven't slowed down, despite the cold...
Is that a good idea?!
It's a perfect fit for me!
Kazuma-san...
Aqua, you should still be keeping them occupied!
No way! You be the decoy this time!
Then you and Sena-san can keep them busy together!
You should be able to walk now.
I don't know who you are, but thanks.
It's embarrassing to do this in front of strangers, but...
but I'm not fully convinced this wasn't just an act to deceive me.
Excuse me.
a6Not happening.
I give up! I'll give up!
Do you ever think about learning skills other than explosion ma
Yeah, I figured.
Some people would pay money to have a slimy girl all over them.
In that case, I may as well join you.
Say, for instance, you were in love with me,
So after provoking me like that, you're not gonna join me?
How dare you?!
She chases after me, claiming to be my rival, after all.
It's bad for my heart!
Why bring that up now?
Wh-Wh-What do we do?!
U-Um, I'd like this!
It's always half-measures with you.
And I intend to put them all into "Explosion Magic Power Boost"
and "High-Speed Casting."
All this talk of duels... For classmates, you guys sure are vicious.

Today is the day we settle this score!
Megumin! Hey, Megumin!
...losion!
...sion!
What do you think of this lovely rainbow?
I give it 120 points!
No, no way!
We are! We are!
I mean, I'm practically useless inside a dungeon!
Those side and part-time jobs
are never going to bring us the kind of money we need!
Well, the thing is...
I see... Then there might still be treasure in the unexplored areas.
I don't want to drag you into it.
Then there's "Foresight."
All thanks to one of the few advantages of the adventurer class:
Go on, state my real class.
Man, these really are all empty.
The thing with dungeons is that there are always undead in them.
Seriously, I have an awful feeling about this!
This is it...
That's not it!
I could see its shape with Foresight, but not what it actually was...
Thank you for that, Aqua-sama.
Aqua, something's up with you today...
Burst forth! Explosion!
A treasure chest! We did it!
Don't! You can't!
And when I proposed, she immediately accepted!
And in spite of myself, I thought that this lich was a pretty cool guy.
didn't his undead minions go after you?
Why are you moving so far away?
Shouldn't we stick together in case a monster attacks?
Don't leave me alone!
You wouldn't really... Cut the cruel jokes!
This proves chances are worth taking, even if they seem unlikely!
And thanks to me, it was a huge success!
But we can at least order refills today, right?
Excuse me! Keep the drinks coming!
You're too young for that!
Hey, Kazuma! Do that thing!
We're gonna drink 'til morning, people!
Yeah!
Darkness went to deal with that lord last night and never came back!
Unbelievable!
What'd you
I-I get it!
an8Help!
I've already cast Explosion,
so all I can do is slow this one down.
Kazuma-san!
i1Our party could always rely on Darkness to be a sturdy albeit disturbing tank,
i1And it's called...
Hey! That arrow almost messed up the best part of my do
No way! You be the decoy this time!
We're done for!
I don't know who you are, but thanks.wat... i guess this is set before the ova
This must be one of those "Hey, it's me!" scams that Kazuma told me about.
I see. Well, I'm one of her party members. Name's Kazuma.
H-Huh?
No, thank you. It's cold.
an8Then when can we have a duel?!
but I'm not fully convinced this wasn't an act to deceive me.
an8Come on, Megumin! Just one little duel!
an8i1Stare...
i1Judging from their builds, Yunyun's gonna win this.
I forfeit! I forfeit!
I was just thinking that you're prettier than that other girl.
Let me give you a great big hug!
Some people would pay good money to have a wet girl all over them.
Besides, if you want to be treated like a lady, you should grow into one first!
Did you just call me a child again?!
I will not! You get me?!
True. Getting in together will solve both our problems.same
E-Excuse me, but wouldn't people usually say something like,
You call me a bitch-chicken?!
Yep.
Yes?
an8Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark...
B-But I can't just visit someone's home unannounced.
Do you have absolutely no social skills whatsoever?Matched to S1 E11
Of course I did!
Would you learn some other magic already?
I know! Why not try it?
In other words,
If you insist, then I will demonstrate for you
What... is this?!
Is she stealing bread crusts?
Wait a minute...
Birthday... by herself?
I wouldn't even mind a demon for a friend at this point.
by revealing scenes of past embarrassment...
How long are you going to mope?
I'm enough of an adult to accept a result without a fuss.
This mouth shitting all over my name and ruining me!
You should be more concerned about that!
Huh? She's... glad?
Yes?
Uh, what are you talking about?
Where are you getting your weird ideas?!
Go on, take that warm bath and cry your heart out.
It's true...
Our valued...
In that case, you have to accept the arrangement, but then ruin it!
Is Satou Kazuma here?!
One of our most precious comrades is facing a grave crisis!
I, Lalatina, have decided to attend the meeting for this arranged marriage.
And these two are...?
I think the "wannabe-butler who's trying too hard" look suits you too, Kazuma.
I would've had to let you have it.
Right, Miss Lalatina?
I simply said that I'd consider the arranged marriage.
L-Lalatina!
You'll give your partner a bad impression.
and was strong enough to achieve knighthood at the earliest age on record.
I-I-I do not look at you that way!
He'd throw an empty bottle at me while saying...
I must say, I'm embarrassed.
Did I overdo it?
A-And of course, in bed at night...
Enough! I can't put up with this any longer!
you should learn to maintain a lascivious gaze, like Kazuma here!
I could never raise my sword to a woman.
You speak frankly, but you still have a charming side.
Demonstrate your ruthlessness and depth of depravity to Walther!
I'd actually like to see
What a creep.
It's clear Kazuma-san is unrivaled at the art of sexual harassment.
Oh, damn it!
This total lack of mercy!
You think you can overpower me?! How insulting!
You should know I wouldn't fight fair!
Because what I have in mind is way crazier than whatever you're thinking!
Even after becoming a crusader, she was still alone.
Nah, I think that's her, not you.
I think you can make Miss Lalatina happier than I could.
I did not! I haven't done anything yet!
Please, forget about this arranged marriage meeting.
I see. You're having Kazuma-kun's child, then?
Beloved Father. I no longer wish to strike a member of my family whom I care for. Are you aware that "tough love" is often harder on the one giving it than on the recipient? Especially on their hearts. So for now, please, allow me to live life as a knight for the time being. From your disobedient daughter, Lalatina.
we found them to be coming from
I'll ask, just in case. You guys don't know anything about this, right?
Well, y'see...
Do you have some disease where you'll freak out if
a6It can't be my fault...
No dungeons... No...
Look, Kazuma!
Leave it to me!
who is rumored to be even more powerful than the Devil King?
but all I do is maintain the barrier around his castle.
I was asked by the Devil King to look into what became of Verdia.
On to my next plan, I suppose.
just because he was anxious about the armor girl's late return home.
Hey, cut that out!
And quit fidgeting, you!
After overcoming taxing trials,
I-I'm not being led anywhere!
H-Huh? Am I the only one feeling really tempted, then?
with the magic circle before heading home?
And just as you're getting your hopes up, you lose!
Oh, my... The dark emotions from you two...
the sooner you'll be wracked with unbearable pain!
Okay, Darkness, let's join Aqua and get the hell out of here.
We'll head outside and have Aqua purify you.
Darkness, you're so stanky!
This is why everyone hates the members of the Axis cult.
Aren't you just a parasite who'd fade away without dark human emotions?
Now, keep it coming, you pitiful adventuring clowns!
Fine, damn it!
Have you always been such an easy woman?
If you can overpower me...
...to try it...
Oh, shut up!
Hey, don't tell him the plan!
It won't come off!
Then you can blast both of us with explosion magic.
Vanir... It wasn't for long, but the time we shared wasn't bad.
To think my death wish would play out like this...
And I absolutely refuse to be purified by the gods I oppose!
If this goes badly, I want you to act as a witness
Adventurer, Satou Kazuma-dono!
people didn't believe that someone connected to the Devil King's army
And next, Lady Dustiness Ford Lalatina.
That's our Lalatina!
I'll chew Kazuma out for letting everyone know your name, Lalatina, as a joke.
After factoring in your debts,
I'm working hard as an adventurer every day.
Okay, even I would rather not end up like that...
Now, girl who had a distant look in her eyes
Defeating Vanir-san has cleared up those spying charges of yours.
Stop making such a fuss and
Don't underestimate me.
I get the feeling I could take anyone on right now!
Fireplace... Sofa...
This isn't the way to the guild.
Is it ready, Pops?
Here you go.
O-ho...
Could someone undo the latches on the back?
Well, better to use the gear you're most familiar with, right?
Hey!
Chunchunmaru.
Say what, now?
What the hell did you just do?!
I can tell that's the Princess, but...
I get it, okay?! It happens every time!
Don't lie down there!
Hey! I beat the one that looked like the King,
Huh?! Why wouldn't you...
K-Kazuma?! Are you all right?!
then that means everyone is safe and well.
I cast Resurrection, so you can come back now.
Aqua, stop Megumin! Stop
What the hell did you do to me?
You'd better not expect a sacred goddess like me to explain what she did.
Self-esteem is a good thing,
Oh, that matter.
I'm acting the same as I always do.
You must have purified it again.
I'll put her through something that'll even make someone
I haven't even moved from this spot since yesterday,
Details
With my shrewd eye for business,
Hey, wait one second... How'd you get inside the mansion?
Your body seems to be on the verge of collapse, Mr. Immensely Strong Demon!
Yeah?
Yeah...
so you can trust I'll fulfill things on my end.
He was arrested for peeping!
was actually a god?
Would you two calm down?
If you'd prefer monthly profit sharing, I can offer you one million eris a month.
I can see you slapping
and stealing the finishing blow after they've weakened the Devil King enough!
Oh, boy!
and secure the best seats!
I just wanted to go because my neck still hurts...
So, Vanir-san, please stop making your way toward me
Wanna buy one?
What the heck?! That's awesome!
It was an emergency!
Rock-paper-scissors!
You're serious?
You coward! What is that?! No fair!
Send me back! Send me back to the heavenly realm, you dirty cheat!
My butt hurts like crazy!
Aww, man!
Yes?
But they say the Princess Runner was killed the other day,
...us!
She's not even being paid!
I'll back her up! Bind!
What?
Did she block the Bind because she knew they'd turn on me if I had hit them?!
I'm so sorry about our party member!
Thank you for your response. I'm doing well.
A game of speed in which competitors charge at an obstacle
It's an emergency! No way around it!
Let me know if it's too much, Darkness!
We're done for!
Thanks, Wiz!
No! Stop it! Don't look, Kazuma!
All right!
Explosion!
Seriously, what were you going to do?
There's a lot of them! But they're moving stiffly...
Your luck ran out when you ran into me!
The scenery is completely different from Axel...
but this place is more beautiful than any of them.
If they're all like this, maybe we should've been visiting different towns all this time.
Well, enjoy your holiday, folks!
Thanks, Pops!
This statue of their goddess is beautiful...
There's a caf run by the Axis Church just up ahead!
W-W-Wait a second!
I'm actually great at telling fortunes!
Grave misfortune awaits you!
And all I have on me is the paperwork for joining the Axis Church!
and then you'll receive some kind power from Aqua-sama
like becoming a good entertainer
You were turned on, weren't you?
Congratulations!
I'd love to give you a commemorative prize, but you see,
Here, take this detergent!
It's actually some amazing stuff!
KONOSUBA!
Thank you, mister, lady!
No, it's fine now! Thank you!
My dear friends, Funifura-san and Dodonko-san. About coming to visit, please don't do it! I'm sure you're busy, so don't put yourselves out on my behalf. I'm actually pretty occupied myself, as well. Is it all right if you wait a bit before coming by? Please. Please, I beg for your patience. -Yunyun
Hang on, did a magic user and an arch priest come by here?
Hey! What're you doing?!
Even the women and children in this town are pretty advanced.
I refuse!
a6Me!
What's with this town? Do something about your followers already.
That little...
on the adventurer guild's help wanted board
Sheesh, I said I was joking.
The bountiful chest on the portrait of the goddess Eris...
Rest easy.
Thou shalt love small breasts.
or a questionably-human fan of animal-eared girls...
but their faith is really strong!
Welcome back!
Are you feeling better?
I'm
Get going already!
Don't mind me.
and it's conversion this, proselytize that,
Guess the town's getting to him, too.
Better not get mixed up with him.
Your logic doesn't make sense!
In any case, what kind of man is he?
but he always helps his friends when they need it.
By the way, Megumin, I was curious about how your butt
Now!
Why do you assume I did something wrong?!
What exactly does "danger in peril" mean?
The guy managing the springs told me this...
And here's the thing about this pot...
Do you think you could swallow a bar of soap?
Soap, detergent, soap, detergent, soap, detergent...
Yes, thank you.
That voice...
I've got a bad feeling about this.
The Devil King's army is currently plotting sabotage against this town!
I just was in the hot springs, and nothing was wrong.
There she is!
Is this some new kind of scam?
Oh, fine! Then I'll reveal my identity!
Yes, I am the one you worship,
I have come here personally to help you all!
If she's really the goddess of water, Aqua-sama, she'd be fine in a lake!
I want booze.
But if I don't do anything, my dear followers will...
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
What is this?!
a6but please head back
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
Tie her up! Take the wench and tie her up!
There she is! I found the wannabe!
The water source up ahead is in danger!
I just want to save the town!
And that blue hairaren't you the one who pulled that prank where you
I'm useful on occasion, you know!
Hey!
Do you want us to treat you as a noble or as part of the gang? Figure it out!
I treat you this way because I genuinely see you as a friend, Darkness.
There it is.
If this is any indicator, the water source has probably been contaminated already.
He looks like he's thinking of throwing himself in there.
Don't do anything rash!
Th-That's so mean!
and in exchange, you don't oppose us?
B-Back then, I couldn't really see what was going on around me...
It's probably hard for you to take him on, so you can stay back.
but we've got Aqua, who can purify poison!
Hans the Deadly Poison Slime.
What the heck?! Scary!
I mean, who'd actually miss the Axis cult?
Fine! Forget it!
Are you sure about this? Things are just going to get worse, at this rate.
Kazuma!
I'll finally be able to leave this disgusting town behind!
Look, I get how you feel...
Hey, wait! What happened to the real overseer?
Since they receive that payment,
The entire area around here is going to be contamina
Purification! Purification! Purification! Purification!
I can't freeze him at that size with my current magic power!
Don't call it sneaky.
Y-Yes! If he were around half his current size...
Megumin! You're gonna light him up! Get ready to go!
A leader-class enemy showing up in a hot springs town...
Wielder of the most glorious, powerful, and grand explosion magic...
Let go of me, you cultist!
Get back!
"You can run away from unpleasant things! That doesn't mean you've lost!
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
has earned you certain doom!
It was you?!
Why's everyone so mad?!
Now, Megumin, today we'll have our duel!
You were out here waiting every day, weren't you?
Oh, very well.
Once winter ends, it'll be spring.
I wake here, sleep here, and live here...
Straight.
You seem like a promising young girl. What's your name?
Huh?! Golem slaying?!
I don't wanna! We don't need to make money anymore so I just wanna take it easy here!
Don't you realise you're an adventurer?!
I guess I've got no choice! Let's go! Let's go right now!
Yeah, no, you don't have to go that far.
Kazuma! I think this might be a bit bad, even for me!
Yes?
Kazuma, Kazuma! Let's catch it and take it home with us!
Let's hang back a bit and see what happens.
I-I'm going to hold you to that!
Something even cooler than that, okay?!
I wasn't looking, nobody was pointing any sleazy eyes at you!
I'll make you a Combining Transformer Dendromaiden out of milk cartons when we get home, so be patient.
I allowed Megumin to blast it with her explosion magic.
Yamamoto, right?
I see you've gone and bought it back, Mitsurugi-kun.
As you can see, I'm a bit busy right now.
su
Or you know, since you've got the Concealment skill you can just go in by yourself.
There are so many magical items here that even I don't understand.
Aqua, those golems must be possessed by ghosts!
Ghosts tend to latch on to humanoids, and they're undead!
God... Requiem...
But I have only one wish:
But it is also the truth that I want to defeat the Demon Lord.
I decided to give up on defeating the Demon Lord.
First, I'll make what every guy yearns for. A bishoujo robot.
They were missing the single most important thing when it comes to creating these bishoujo golems!
Or the very structure itself?
Well, let's come back to that later.
Ko
Hey, Kazuma, let's just go home. I think we've done enough investigating.
And it might go berserk at any moment, just like that giant golem.
But it's good to see that you've finally realised that you're a veteran adventurer.
Why, thank you.
Ah
Everyone, get behind me!
Yeah, I think this is the fastest he's ever replied.
If you're after that kind of play, I'll do it with you later so get back here!
It's time for your punishment.
Shh.
The truth will be revealed soon enough, and she'll be disgusted by him.
Thanks for the drink!
That party causes a lot of trouble, but they really do shine when it counts.
I understand that, but...
It's not what you think! We're just following orders from the higher-ups in the guild...
...losion!
I mean, I'm completely useless inside a dungeon!
Remember what you said when you joined the party?
Hey, can't we wait until Darkness gets back?
Our debt rivals a small nation's GDP!
If we don't do something, we'll starve to death!
an8Why can't you guys get it?!
an8Are you stupid?! Yes, you're stupid!
Hasn't this place been thoroughly explored already?
A hidden passage to a new area was recently discovered.
which means your Lurk skill will be next to useless.
i1She's definitely gonna screw something up!
My Enemy Detection is tingling.picking it up.
Oh, what's this?
Okay, put a light on!
You said that you'd heard me rustling around when we were sleeping in the stables.
So someone else made it this far before?
Kazuma, you were all like, "Phwah!"
You called?Yes, Kazuma here.
That quip just now made me feel like a burglar.
Yeah, Enemy Detection's going off.
I-I just shat bricks!B-Bricks from my ass!
i1You could take her out in public and not be ashamed of her! Like an actual goddess!
Oh? Finally realizing how great I am?
Wait.
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff...
I built this dungeon and kidnapped a noble's daughter.
I'm speechless.
She passed on in peace.
i1It seems that Keele was gravely injured while protecting his wife.
Thank you so much.
All right. Let's go.
That guy said he woke up because he sensed a tremendous holy power.
We didn't run into all those undead back there
They'll add criminal negligence to your record!
You're not ditching me down here!
Hey, let go!
Hang on, Kazuma!
an8Kazuma, he...
Imagine the immense sorrow all the devout Axis cult members of the world would feel!
We can divide up the spoils 9010!
All I did was wait at the entrance, so it doesn't feel like I deserve it,
Nope!
Part-time jobs can kiss my holy ass! From now on, we're questing!
That's Kazuma-san for you!
All right, ladies! Drink 'til you drop!
It's my last hope!
We haven't repaid any of our debt, and Darkness still isn't back!
Darkness!
What are you doing?!
but he thinks highly of Aldarp's son.
And do it without besmirching your family's name.
i1but Megumin can be sharp at the worst possible times.
I'm the only one?!
Y-You're certain, then, Lalatina?
I, Lalatina, have decided to attend the meeting for this marriage.adding name because that's clearly what the other two are pissing themselves over
i1Her father ended up asking me for help.
My sole wish is for your happiness, milady.
Milady! Please watch your step!
I'm even prepared to be disinherited!
Even then, I will survive as best I can
an8That sounds like a perv, not the Devil King.
He'd throw an empty bottle at me and say to me...
An upstart noble's son like you couldn't possibly
Why don't you two go for a walk in the garden?
I enjoy a bit of goblin hunting
I'll test your mettle there!
Hey! Darkness...
See?!
Isn't this enough?! Why won't you give up?!
You spineless fool!
Now, come on, Kazuma!
You've earned Miss Lalatina's trust.
See, Walther?!
Weak sh-NEET Kazuma has no chance against you in a grappling match!
I can see you on your knees, pleading for mercy already!
an8i1She's stopped even trying to maintain a grip.
K-K-K-Kazuma!
Every day, she'd visit the Church of Eris,
and pray for friends with whom to adventure.
Please.
These clothes... Is it already over?
I see. You're having Kazuma-kun's child.
G-Gotta tell someone... Gotta tell the guys in town!
I'll ask, just in case. You guys don't know anything about this, right?
Of course not!
"Because of me"?
Well, y'see...
The monsters aside,
I appreciate your cooperation.
Something about the mask on those dolls disgusts me on an instinctive level.
but somehow, it's starting to look kinda cute
Right.
Kazuma, stay behind me.
R-Right.
so you can experience the same trauma as Aqua.
Hey, wait up! Can we slow down a
You'd challenge me, Vanir-san,
A commander in name only, if you will.
While I was in Axel, I decided to drop in on the knucklehead shopkeeper
And the greatest sustenance for demons
You see, I have a rather sublime death wish.
Then I station demons in each room and set up traps.
the brave adventurers make their way to the innermost chamber!
But I was passing by this place,
Let's take a look.
to the point that you're squirming in anticipation!
I am not overwhelmed or squirming!
If you're threatening Aqua, then I cannot stand down!
For all your fire, your attacks don't seem to be landing!
Where did that sneaky-looking lad go?
Nice try!
Damn it, why was that thing lying on the floor?
And just as you're getting your hopes up, you lose!
Oh, my... The dark emotions from you two...
Well, boy? If you think you can attack this girl...
Impossible... What is this
Oh, we can't have that.
Sacred Exorcism!
O-One of the Devil King's commanders?!
To unleash anti-demon magic at first sight...
Nice try!
I can't hit her! She deflects us with her sword like we're nothing!
This body is quite functional.
And I'm supposed to have good luck?!
Kazuma, you've got me backing you up!
Come on, Darkness! Show him what you've got!
Should I go ahead and fire?
I couldn't!
leave me and be purified,
I'll take full responsibility for this, too.
The unspoken faith displayed before me...
Th-This kind of embarrassment isn't the crazy thing I was hoping for...
Father, Mother. Are you doing well?
Okay, even I would rather not end up like that...
But we weren't able to savor our victory for long.
I probably shouldn't say such a thing...
Wiz, we need to tell you something...
Did you actually think that I had perished?!
Congratulations!
You, boy from a distant land...
I've got an excellent offer. Care to hear it?
And the first idea for this plan was the kotatsu I am currently under.
She's right, Kazuma.
Ow! My head...
This isn't the way to the guild.
You just need to write a name for it on this talisman, and attach it to the handle.
I guess clothes really do make the man.
I want to at least make sure it has a cool name...
Masamune? Kotetsu?
When entering their mating period, the males gather around the Princess Runner,
It's okay.
Listen...
Even if I do I defeat the Devil King with this sword,
I can endure as many of them as needed!
And if any get through, just leave them to me.
Hey, Aqua! Which one's the King?
And if I have to make up for it later, it'll just be the same as always!
They'll actually trample you to death!
Kazuma! I don't have enough magic power to activate my explosion magic!
I'm sorry. I have no excuse for what happened this time.
If I'm bored,
Every now and then, I sneak off to the surface to have some fun.
I'll be back a little later!
I want to talk with Eris-sama a bit!
Hurry and level up so you can beat the Devil King and get me back to the heavenly realm!
a6The padded goddess down there actually
Hey, cut it out!
it's gonna be even worse, you hear?
Seriously, what did she do to me?
Y'know, Kazuma...
Damn it all!
a6So please, turn back to normal, Kazuma!
I'm so sorry! So please, turn back to normal!
Thank you, Aqua. I'll finish this as it is.
That little loli brat!
And what exactly is this thing that will make even Megumin cry for mercy?
Did you think it was the crazy little Crimson Demon girl?
Your body seems to be on the verge of collapse, Mr. Immensely Strong Demon!
I just found myself curious about that flimsy thing posted around the mansion.
only to then collect a tithe as a means of robbing them of their money!
How about it, boy?
A million a month?!
A million a month?
Oh, how silly of me!
Oh, it's just, seeing Kazuma gradually becoming more and more pathetic
Ugh! What am I supposed to do?!
Let's go right away!
NOSUBA!
Babysitting, huh?
It was an emergency!
Sounds good, Aqua. Rock-paper-scissors, huh?
No one said it was by elimination!
Now, here we go! Rock-paper-scissors!
Hey, you little bitch!
is the fact that you describe what you've been doing as "gracious help"!
I guess this is new, even for the lady of a noble house.
We'll move to a different wagon when we get to a stop.
would have to be a pack of Lizard Runners.
so it might just be a Sandwhale kicking up some sand.
Huh? They do seem to be headed this way...
They charge at the hardest thing they can find!
Wait somewhere safe!
And right now, she has been chosen as the obstacle in this dangerous game.
Oh, boy! Here they come, here they come!
K-Kazuma, this time... this time I'm surely done for!
Kazuma! Do you suppose this counts as a type of teasing?
Unbelievable. Males in heat are leaping over me, one after another!
All thanks to my Blessing!
Pops, are there any cliffs around here?!
We can't wait much longer!
I-It wasn't my idea! It was Darkness!
I'm ready to fire my magic anytime!
To think you had a magic user powerful enough to use explosion magic!
And an arch priest able to treat all the injured with no trouble!
And being able to used advanced magic to slow them down with that swamp magic!
Not to mention the inspired decision to lure the enemy into the cave so that
they could be dealt with all at once!
To think that true adventurers like you people still exist in this harsh world!
Again! Do that trick again!
Handle things here! I'll get Aqua!
these zombies probably wouldn't have shown up in the first place.
Those are a local specialty, Arcan steamed buns.
The curative effects of the hot springs here are said to be extraordinary!
Jarippa is being taken away!
Such beautiful light blue hair!
R-Right. Good idea.
Hey!
But if you convert to the Axis faith, your misfortune can be avoided!
Hey, let go!
You're not with the Axis Church, are you?
You are the millionth to pass down this street!
we can get your name, and you can receive your prize...
Remember? We were classmates in school!
I've changed a lot since joining the Axis Church,
Oh, don't worry about paying!
What is wrong with this town?
This is for you, on the house.
KONOSUBA!
No, it's fine now! Thank you!
Sure. My name is written like
Did you hear? Starting next year, there won't be any more tuna.
What?! Come on, today's Explosion magic was worth at least worth 120 points!
He's the kind of scumbag who'd dropkick a woman without a second thought!
Hey, it's Yunyun. What's got you so looking so intense?
Ow!
What is wrong with you, Yunyun?!
Once we have this baby,
an8How dare you?!
Th-Thank you...
And was that seriously all it took to convince you it was me?!
Because if not, then I want you to forget about this prophecy!
I understand. In that case, you can count on me.
we won't die out, even if the village is destroyed.
Wh-Who are you calling a tsundere?!
The girl who's been useless as of late, except at calling in familial favors!
That said, my debt-ridden fellow, the deal hasn't been completed yet.
Okay, I'll send you to the vicinity of the Crimson Demon Village now.
Hey there, handsome! Wanna have some fun with me?
And on the rare occasion that one is born,
We'll give you a taste of heaven on earth!
Darkness!
We'll move into a white house by the sea
Let me go! I just wanna go home!
But he's so shy!
I'm willing to overlook this because we're neighbors!
P-Please don't do that!
And in the case of Yunyun, if you can believe it...
Y-You coward! You never play fair, Megumin!
W-Wait a second... You're not gonna...
No doubt about it, though.
We were told that the village might be in danger.
That was just me sending you an update!
Should be showing up anytime now.
Devil King Army alert.
Holy crap...
The one who's supposed to smooth a situation like this over is...
Oh, wow! How'd you do it?! How are you doing that?
Oh, really? After all that bluster just now,
This is going to be our dinner tonight.
you stared up her skirt while sitting across from her and holding your knees.
You feed Chomusuke and say,
I am so sorry!
Hang on a sec.
There's only one futon. It's spring, but nights are still cold.
This isn't about getting sued! My entire perspective is off-base!
Let's say I panic and jump out of the futon.
And... why am I sleeping in the same futon as you?
Spell what out?!
Come on, you really think I'd try to pull something?
I've even got your parents' approval!
You idiot! I suspected as much!
Could you show us the sights around here?
I'm sorry.
Welcome, folks! It's been a while since I've had outsiders in the shop.
All of them?
it can't hurt to have a few more in my wardrobe.
It never rusts, so it's super handy.
That's what I thought.
W-Welcome...
He's probably still bitter about not fitting in.
I am called Funifura!
At... what was it again?
And Megumin was sad on her own,
She picked it up at an awkward time,
so she wasn't able to learn advanced magic before graduation.
while I was hesitating...
How dare you?!
Darkness! Good job hanging in there!
and even the Devil King's general is a woman!
You're ruining that impressive performance!
I heard he never returned from the town of Axel...
It's Mitsurugi.
I am called Satou Kazuma!
He who will obtain the wealth to spend his days having fun with the rest of you!
So am I. Here's to a bright future.
H-Hey! If you start clinging to me like that...
Huh?
You ever think about the trouble you cause other people, dumbass?!
Hell yeah, you did!
You mean to tell me this little thing is the Cursed Sword Gram?
You're not Mitsurugi, are you?
But this is the kind of luck where I'd expect some kind of backlash.
Have I actually entered a popular phase?
Yes, Sylvia, the Growth Chimera!
I want sincerity!
Obviously not!
that brings men to their knees!
How can you be so oblivious?!
Sylvia-san! Sylvia-san!
No!
Settle down!
Do the things you do not bother you?
Wait, damn it!
an8I managed to trap Sylvia in here with a bit of skillful deceit.
Ah!
Aw, come on!
That's the Mage Killer!
Village Chief!
I'm so sorry. It was me who let that thing out!
The village... is burning.
There are?!
O-Okay, let's head there right now!
Not bad. If anything, things like this are our style!
Yeah!
I'm sure the craftsman I know can help you!
Is there something wrong with the Crimson Demons?!
Burn! Burn!
I'm sorry you had it so rough until now.
I only made it this far because of you all.
Don't stop now! Keep lighting her up!
We can't take on the Mage Killer after all!
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!
F-Forgive me! Just forget I said anything!
It comes! It comes! The hordes of flame...
Now display your force, by my command!
It just didn't have enough magic power!
Seems like you've got some kind of scheme in mind.
Wha...
Slow down! Kazuma-san, wait for me!
Faster! You need to run faster!
Wiz?! What are you doing here?
You can't hide the truth from a demon that reads minds.
She's fighting Wiz and Vanir and still has the edge!
Damn it! Maybe there's a weakness? Like what?!
Like? Like...
Kazuma?
Could it be...
What?!
Everyone!
When I was on the verge of death, I realized something!
Sylvia-sama! I love you!
I have relationships, but no love!
My life won't shine until I finally have love in it!
Megumin-san, Yunyun-san,
it's all yours!
Megumin, have you lost faith in Explosion magic?
Explosion magic is the stuff of dreams!
And so, my popular phase came to an end.
Even with my higher than average luck stat,
this was an incredibly risky move.
Let's all cheer for Kazuma!
Here.
Arch wizard and wielder of Explosion magic!
Axel's foremost mage,
If you know one who can do better than that, I'd like to meet them.
Well, I packed them for the picnic, so now they're lunch!
Damn you, you damned undead!
I'll burn this shop to the ground in the name of the gods
Do you not even serve tea at this shop?
H-Here you go.
There are lots of crazy people in the Axis sect.
Damn you! Damn you and these damns!
That's quite a feat.
I've never once caused anyone any harm,
Yes, yes! That's correct!
Hang on, hang on.
Besides,
O-Of course,
H-Huh?!
You think I'll let her suck anything out of me?!
Look, we're not getting anywhere, so let her!
U-Um, Aqua-sama?
Ow!
But the landlord certainly is generous, allowing us to live here as a reward if we can exorcise it.
with neither lust nor passion in his heart.
Are you all right?
I'm the one who should be saying that!
Why did you come barging into this room?
I thought Aqua had come back.
How can you try to relieve yourself alone?
What happened to crimson demons not using the bathroom?!
so could you sing a song or something in a loud voice?
I know you're in a tough spot, too!
How can anyone have so little common sense?!
At least you got halfway through your business!
I'm about to explode!
but even the guild was bothered
Hey. You know what's going on, don't you? Spill it.
Uh-huh.
i1This is obviously wrong.
Kazuma! Food's ready! Get in!
It's in the rules.
Oh, what's this?
Hey, Kazuma!
i1We acquired a mansion,
run by succubi, where they give you sweet dreams?
the other adventurers would notice instantly and beat him to a bloody pulp.
would simply chop off his happy hammer with a hidden dagger.
i1If everyone was in a constant state of afterglow,
For reals.
I just... How to say this...
i1Yes, there's no problem if it's in a dream!
I'm home!
I can hardly believe that my eyes could feast on marbled red crab!
and then unleash my explosion magic after eating it all!
Th-That form, shape, and movements!
an8But you want to see it again?
Tomorrow. I'll have some tomorrow.
i1Not when you normally blurt out nothing but nasty stuff that creeps me out!
i1That's right.
i1Maybe I should just drink up and forget about the dream.
What's with that reaction?
an8Something wrong?
Back please. Come on.
Come on...
Totally...
Everyone, some freak broke into the mansion!
This freak got caught in my barrier! It's like flypaper for freaks...
Resistance is futile.
I'm a goddess. This semen demon isn't getting off. Not on my watch.
He's been acting strange for a while now!
Fine.
You don't remember any of it since you were under that succubus's spell, right?
Yeah, unfortunately, I don't remember a thing.
It was an accident.
i1It's the best alibi that I never thought up,
i1so I'm rolling with it.
The mobile fortress, Destroyer, is currently approaching this city!
Fight the mobile fortress, Destroyer?
We will be indebted to your bravery so long as we live.
No, we can't.
Maybe, but I won't know until I try.
If we need firepower, we have her.
The crazy one.
I'm sorry for being so selfish and stubborn.
Please leave it to me, Aqua-sama.
I may not look it, but I am the highest-ranked undead.
When this is all over, I'm gonna marry her.
Huh?
What?!
i1All hands, evacuate immediately.
A knight must never flee before her countrymen.
What is this unparalleled arousal, glopping forth from my soul?
I'll be back!
I owe this city so much!
Take a look at that.
They asked what I would need to power it. Nothing can!
I'll spend the rest of my life right here.
With pleasure.
I should be able to cast Teleport now!
Do that, then!
It's not over.
Out of mana?
Wait! If you pump her full of my holy mana, she'll disappear!
All right, here goes!
Don't suck out too much, okay?!
You've taken a ton of my mana. Like, a lot.
Whoa. Oh, yes. Oh, yes!
Oh, blackness shrouded in light...
Forget the incantation!
obliterated Overlord Aldarp's mansion.
I have another adventure to attend to.
i1That's right. Nothing goes the way I want it to at all.
Damn publishers. Store-exclusive preorder merch is the bane of my existence, and they know it.
i1Sunlight is a killer after three straight all-nighters.
Just one question...
You passed out and were taken to a nearby hospital,
My name is Aqua.
You can start from square one with a new life,
I see...
It could be a powerful weapon, or a tremendous talent.
So all you need to do is choose a powerful ability or piece of equipment.
Now, choose!
Nobody's expecting much from a shut-in gamer geekotaku anyway.
Your request has been approved.
I shall perform your duties in your absence, Aqua-sama.
Please have a safe trip, Aqua-sama.
Whoa, for reals?!
Hey, shut up.
Isn't there a bare minimum of starter equipment I should
I'll work out the rest on my own.
What do I do? Huh? What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to do now?!
Oh, right.
Thank you.
Hey!
Okay.
Hey, what should we do?
We've already hit a roadblock.
I'm Aqua.
If thou art one of my followers...
It keeps track of how many monsters you've vanquished.
This will calculate your current status.
Average across the board.
Of course, luck isn't a very essential stat for an adventurer.
Y-You're right!
Aside from your below average intelligence,
but maybe I can be an archpriest who heals her allies.
Nothing. Just shut up.
Say...
Count on someone who can barely count?
This city is the furthestis the furthest city from the Demon King's castle.
Now, let's go on that kill quest!
I have faith in you.
i1In fact, farmers and children from the settlement
Kazuma!
Let's try again after we get better equipment.
i1and drools while she sleeps in a freaking stable.
Gimmashish annuzzhah, mizzy!Hit me, baby! One more time!
There's no way the two of us can take them on alone.
It's a little tough, but when you get pastbeyond that...
i1but there's no sign of any prospective future heroes.
i1all thanks to joining the great Aqua's party!
That we would meet is a fate chosen by the world itself.
That red eye... Are you a crimson demon?
crimson demons are born with high intelligence and mana reserves.
and they all have weird names.
Oh?
Ow! My eye!
You were talking gibberish and gave us that weird name.
So this girl's clan has a lot of good magicians, right?
It's an advanced class that commands powerful offensive magic!
Right. You got it.
Let's see if you've still got it.
She'll say some pretty wonky stuff sometimes.
She put her life on the line to buy us time.
Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary,
the ultimate offensive magic!
Huh?
My mystic art, explosion magic, possesses tremendous might.
Sorry, could you help me ou
I stink... I stink!
That's information I didn't need to know.
For real?
If your level is high enough to use explosion magic,
I can only love explosion magic!
but explosion magic is still the only magic I'll ever love!
i1Damn, this magician's useless too.
We are!
Um...
but the truth is that while I have confidence in my strength and stamina, I am clumsy.
No.
I could learn to use explosion magic, too?
You can't be so pushy.
Steal!
i1A bit steep for learning a new skill.
i1At long last, my first adventurer-y event in this world!
Enemy Detection: one point.
Five points for a measly party trick?!
so I said I'd pay any price
So, Kazuma, were you able to learn the thief skills?
What happened?
The item stolen should be random.
I cannot allow this to pass!
there's something I have to tell you.
but we honestly intend to defeat the Demon King.
I shall obliterate his vile presence with our strongest of magics!
In fact, this concerns you most of all.
They're coming!
Adventurers!
and will go for 10,000 eris per head!
I'll hold them off! Run! Save him!
I-I can't!
Just doing the healing that archpriests are supposed to do!
an8Really?
an8Steal!
Most importantly, you saw my abilities as a crusader.
but don't expect me to be much help offensively.
I'm an archpriest,
i1But...
i1...she's a goddamn freak.
Refreshing, delicious, generic starting spell.
an8I went through hell for these! Useless bitch!
i1Thanks to that surprise emergency quest,
i1were apparently jam-packed with XP.
K-Kazuma-sama,
In fact, I assumed I'd be rolling in dough,
so I worked up a tab of nearly 100,000 eris!
Like I care!
I'll lend you the money, so shut up!
We're the best party ever!
Kazuma actually looks like a real adventurer.
I paid my tab, but I don't have any lunch money!
No frogs!
You see, one of the Demon King's vassals recently moved into the area.
so there's been a sharp decline in available quests.
Vassal, shmassal, big-ass tassel
if he's an undead, I'll take him down facile, no hassle!1010
So basically,
Cast your spell on whatever, and we can go home.
i1Left dead broke, useless bitch Aqua found a job and made herself useful.
on!
You lost points on loudness.
That one was pretty good!
I'm sure you will.
you should think up some kind of money-for-nothing-chicks-for-free business.
i1Bitch, I'll slap you.
Hey, what the hell?
That's a dullahan!
I can't use explosion magic!
Um, I'm still a novice!
It'll take more than a low-level priest from this town to purify me.
so that we would obey your every order to have it removed?
Huh?
You're embarrassing the dullahan!
q2I'll nail that dullahan with a shot of my explosion magic and lift the curse on Darkness.
A Nature's Beauty of victory!
Can we trust Aqua withon this?
Hey, check this one out!
The reward is 300,000 eris."
Can you purify water?
Who do you think I am?
How would you purify it, anyway?
I think I've got a way for you to purify the lake safely.
What're you complaining about?
No sign of monsters anywhere.monsters are showing up.
My ultimate explosion magic
You, Aqua, and the Queen of England.
Purification!
It looks kind of fun inside that cage.
Don't you dare.
It seems the alligators have all gone, too.
That's my Kyouya!
Hey, now, quit it.
Kyouya's mine, got that?!
Now, chosen hero, depart on your journey with the Cursed Sword, Gram.
Good Goddess!
Hey.
It's me, Mitsurugi Kyouya!
I've sent along so many people!
i1Because she didn't want to get out of it.
What?!
i1You barely even know the bitch.
Is there no limit to your impertinencerudeness?!
Have you no shame?
but something about him makes me want to hit him.
That's right, you scum-dwelling cad! Knave!
I'm an advocate of true gender equality.
perhaps you should know that the sword is no longer in his possession.
It's the truth!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma-san and his party in particular,
My body just craves something big and hard.
Stop squirming, you freak!Watch the body language, you freak!
He started it!
Though in death, I fell to evil, in life, I strove to be an upstanding knight.
Do you think a beginninglow-level adventurer's magic can
Are you really a beginner?
F-Fine, then.
Seriously, what have I done to deserve this?I've really been a good girl every day, so why?!
Wielder of the finest magic crimson demons possess, commander of explosion magic!
I'll blow them all away later.
All right, then, as promised...
Someone's bound to hit him if we all attack at once!
Sing to the Motherland!
...you'll have to make do!
In fact, whip 'em out now!
Huh?
What are you trying to do, boy?!
Stop that, you pests!
Damn it! I'm gonna run out of mana!
Apologize for calling a water goddess a "lame goddess"!
Come on!
Are you an idiot?
You're right.
For Sedol, the huge liar who said I wore my armor to hide my washboard abs.
I've been waiting for you, Kazuma!
No, wait, that isn't what I...
Um, why us?
Kazuma! Kazuma!
an8Nope. No problems.
Nope, because I was never a NEET!
Nope. No buts! I've made up my mind!
Don't "huh" me, you useless goddess!
Um, Kazuma-san...
the flood of water Aqua-san summoned
This looks familiar.
One more night in that damn stable, and I'm gonna to freeze to death!
Wait! I'm sorry!
That's my name.I'm Kazuma.
Yet strangely, the kids all love it!
What's this?
There are lots of Snow Sprites in the snowy plains.
No problem.
Damn! It's darting all over the place!
And that makes four!
I caught a bunch!
Yeah! Wipe 'em all out!
Huh?
You lived in Japan,
but he will likely be beyond my capabilities, and I'll be violatedI'll be shamed...
are all completely retarded!
General Winter is merciful.
Yes.
so you can come back to this side now!
An exception! I'll deem this an exception!
Pads are fine too.same
i1Th-This is kind of extremely embarrassing.
Like words of gratitude,
i1despite the scarce food and harsh environment,
I'm taking him home and using him as a refrigerator!
The reward for killing those is 100,000 each!
He even has a name!
and when summer comes, you'll make me lots of ice.
Y-You're not eating him!
great sacrifices are necessary in order to function.
Huh?
i1I normally shut myself in at home,
Just one question...
No, you died of shock.
but you're the first human I've seen die in such a bizarre way.
Well, then...
I've vented enough stress for now.
I'm a goddess in charge of guiding humans from Japan who die young to the afterlife.
or you can go to Heaven and carry on like an old man.
Huh?
is under assault by the Demon King's army!
All live in fear of the demon army's merciless pillage and slaughter!
You'll have a fresh start to your life with all of your original memories intact.
It's all the same, whatever you pick.
It's illegal! This has to be illegal!
Brave hero, I pray that of the great many prospective heroes,
Now, go forth on your journey!
Hey, this really is a parallel world!
A fresh start in a fresh world!
Okay, calm down, Goddess.
If you're a goddess, wouldn't you know where we can find an adventurer's guild?
Scary!
And what's with the weird getup?
Why did you stay in your room all day, every day, doing the whole sh-NEET thing?
Um, I'm still thinking about it.
and enough money to cover basic living expenses, at least.
This must be fate. I saw earlier that you couldn't cover the fee, correct?
This is your registration card.
What's going on?
Aside from your below average intelligence,
all of your stats are drastically above average!
and boasts enough strength to stand at the front lines!
You might actually be able to beat the Demon King, you reckless wench!
We didn't come here to be transmigrant workers.
What is it?
I was just thinking.
You can count on me!
Now that I think about it,
Minimum wage?
Huh?
If the followers of Axis see me sullied like this,
i1It's a little late to be worrying about appearances.
5,000 eris per frog...
and we'll have a whole line of people begging to join!
i1but there's no sign of any prospective future heroes.
N-No!
Indeed! I am Megumin, user of the finest magic the crimson demons possess!
Oh?
Ow! My eye!
Sorry. I thought you were making fun of us.
Two at once?
Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark,
The time of awakening cometh.
Explosion!
Did the explosion wake it up?
For real.
and I may collapse afterwards,
If we ever meet again, your drink's on me
Hey, stop! You're getting it on my face!
What debauchery have they suffered at the mercy of that decadent?!
I-It's not like that!
comes to 110,000 eris.
We nearly lost our lives for a reward of 36,000 each.
It's not worth it.
i1Looking for a practice partner for magical experiments.
Our new party member is useless.
j-j-j-j-join your party!
i1of a popular online game that goes on sale today.
i1Time to go home and play the hell out of this.
What about the girl I pushed out of harm's way?
Huh? Wait a second.
i1Damn you!
You can start from square one with a new life,
We've got you covered there.
Now, choose!
That's right.
No way! Come on, now...
Wait! Wait!
you shall be the one to defeat the Demon King.
Hey, shut up.
Scary!
Hey!
Do you have any money?
Are you ready to order?
Um, I'm still thinking about it.
And now you're back to being useless.
S-Sure...
Of course, luck isn't a very essential stat for an adventurer.
You can skip straight to almost any advanced class!
You might actually be able to beat the Demon King, you reckless wench!
What's wrong? Did you forget to use the outhouse before bed?
We didn't come here to be transmigrant workers.
Now that I think about it,
Job-hoppers can't even afford
What are those? Are they tasty?
It's almost noon.
i1In fact, farmers and children from the settlement
Huh?
and pray to me three times a day.
And
I'll lose their devotion!
i1and drools while she sleeps in a freaking stable.
Behold the power of the gods!
This is surprisingly tasty.
i1Immediate opening! We're a cozy, harmonious party.
Um...
Are you just here to laugh at us?
If it were ever removed,
I'm sorry! Please don't pull on it!
Stop... Stop it!
You see,
an8so please just slowly put it back where it was.
an8That's right, slowly, slowly...
That's awful rude.
Adventurer cards can't be forged.
It's the most advanced offensive magic there is!
Kazuma, over there!
As for the closer one...
Goddess?
but this time for sure...
May you roll in your grave for eternity!
Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark,
Return all creation to cinders!
I used up all my mana,
Eh?
I can't.
You follow your heart's desire knowing perfectly well that it makes you ineffectual! I'm moved!
I don't mind all that.
Glad to have you aboard!
The lower your level, the faster you advance.
Please verify the amount.
We nearly lost our lives for a reward of 36,000 each.
Can't I go back to Japan?ur ded m8
Though, I'd really advise against joining.
My name is Darkness.
My name is Darkness.
Um...
i1No, that isn't it!
Hup!
Thank you! Thank you!
Heck, is there any other skill more worthwhile to learn?
i1Crap!
i1I was trying to turn her down politely.
Shall we continue where we left off yesterday?
Please let me join your party
i1She looks at least half sane.
Here I go. Watch carefully.
If successful, you take possession of one item that your opponent has on them."has on them" being suggestive.
i1this is exactly the sort of exchange between rowdy adventurers that I've been craving!
Then let's do this.
Nature's Beauty...
And the consolation prize will be...
Let's do this!
Did your stats go up with your level,
The thing is...
Since ancient times,
Wait, what?
One who commands explosion magic!
In fact, this concerns you most of all.
in a secluded region yet unsullied by man.
is catch as many as we can,
and will go for 10,000 eris per head!
A scratch!
i1watching me stripped of my garments, their very souls aroused!
Yes, you can!
Summon before me the root of thy power hidden within the lands
of the kingdom of demise!
Explosion!
i1I didn't come to a parallel world to fight cabbage.
an8Really?
You blew away the entire swarm of cabbages with a single spell!
Oh, Kazuma!
Megumin's an archwizard,
i1I wouldn't have any reason to refuse if she were normal.
Create Water!
an8Irresistible. Irresistible!
Hey, what's the meaning of this?!
Just how many cabbages do you think I caught?!
Lettuce isn't worth very much.
i1I guess my high luck stat came in handy.
K-Kazuma-sama,
Fine, okay?! Fine!
I was thinking of going shieldless, for a sword mage style.
Covered in slime?!
We're so sorry.
Seriously?
if he's an undead, I'll take him down facile, no hassle!1010
I'm completely paralyzed after one cast.
i1going to make me tag along for this every day?
Cast your spell on whatever, and we can go home.
i1Darkness said she was going to head home for some weight training.
i1I came to be able to discern the quality
Why not learn explosion magic for real?
To be bluntFrankly, I'm starting to think we should just give up on taking down the Demon King.
q2And teach me your healing spells, 'cause they're the last things you've got going for you.
I wouldn't mind if you verbally abused me instead.
What's going on?
Hey, what the hell?
Who here can use explosion magic?
then stay in town, trembling with fear!
I am a crimson demon, and the greatest magician in this town!
You came alone, right into the trap. Like a rat.
I didn't come here to deal with small fry.
However...
You should've thought twice before picking a fight in this town while I was here!
Listen, crimson demon girl.
Until then, your dear friend will suffer as the fear of death consumes her.
You should have done as I said.
but you will never control my heart!
Stop casting explosion spells on my castle!
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
I'm sick of working part-time in the shopping district!
The hell do you think you're doing?!What are you trying to accept?!
Oh, please.
Water! Do you not see these beautiful aqua-blue eyes and hair?!
Heck, take it solo so you can keep the reward for yourself.
Well, for a goddess of my class,
is not to be used on the likes of mere alligators.
I'll see that the next quest we accept takes longer than a day. Then we'll see if they do or not.
Crimson demons really don't go to the bathroom, okay?
Purification! Purification! Purifica
Purification! Purification!
Aqua! Let us know if you want to give up!
The cage just made a sound no cage should ever make!
Don't you dare.
Purification! Purification! Purification!
Hey, Aqua. We talked it over,
The alligators are gone.
we're in town now, so stop singing that song.
The outside world is scary. I'm not going out there.
She's just like I used to be.
Good Goddess!
It has been a while, O great Aqua-sama.
O great Aqua-sama, I don't know how this man won you over,
i1Blah, blah, blah. Keep running it, asshole.
i1You barely even know the bitch.
I see. You are blessed with wonderful party members.
You have such excellent people here,
This guy seriously creeps me out.
I challenge you to a duel.
Knave, knave, knave!
Give back Gram!
i1Crap...
She said my reward,
What's more, there seem to be rumors that you're into getting girls covered in slime.
Hey, wait! Tell me who's spreading that around!
Huh?
No, stop! Please hear me out!
that crusader, the paradigm of knightliness,
What?
an8That's so pathetic!
He went "Gah!" and all.alt: He screamed in pain and everything.
Wh-What do we do, Kazuma?
Call a priest!
I've been a good girl every day, too!
Not when they're all moving everywhere.
I keep casting Turn Undead, but they won't leave me alone!
i1Wait a second...
She did it! The crazy crimson demon girl did it!
i1Aqua's magic isn't enough to deliver a fatal blow.
It's inevitable that a holy knight would be my opponent!
Darkness, stand down!
Hit me more! More!
Nothing, damn it!
Nothing, damn it!
i1Undead monsters' weaknesses are...
Stop that, you pests!
Or are you just an idiot?
Are you an idiot?
Only your feet?
For Sedol, the huge liar who said I wore my armor to hide my washboard abs.
Don't worry.
Oh, Kazuma-san, I've been waiting for you.
There may have been an old legend like that.
i1This isn't really my thing, but it is kinda nice.
In recognition of the achievements of Satou Kazuma-san and his party,
an8Nope. No waits.
an8Nope. No problems.
and the cost for repairs is 340 million, huh?
This looks familiar.
Feeling guilty yet? Then give me the life I deserve!
A-choo!
Praise me, praise me, and spoil me rotten!
Did you find a good quest?
"The mobile fortress 'Destroyer' approaches!
It lumbers around, trampling everything in its path.
What's this?
I'm gonna catch Snow Sprites and bottle them up!
I'm a genius, right?
i1We all know how this is gonna end.
topple this white world!
Explosion!
But the only people stupid enough to run around outside in the winter
i1When this is over, I'm gonna step on the girl who's been playing dead this whole time.
What is it this time?!What-ever is it?!
i1The former something-or-other, who appears to have abandoned all pride,
a knight would never bow her head to a monster!
That godawful goddess who came with me as a reincarnation perk
Oh, for real?!
Um,
Aqua-senpai is as unreasonable as ever.
They're really pads?!
Oh, finally. You're up.
Hey, come on, Kazuma.
I brought you back to life, you know.
Come on.
i1is a season where only those who make it through the struggle for survival,
I pretended to set them all free, but I kept one hidden.
Way to go, Aqua!
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!
I bet it'd taste delicious with a sprinkle of sugar.be delicious to put some sugar on it and eat it.
The least you could do is let me eat all I want!
Bitch, what the hell you doing?!
Ow!
Oh! I-I'm sorry!
i1This is Wiz.
i1and let her go scot-free, but...
Could you teach me a skill?
so when I heard that she's the head goddess of the Axis sect...
an8Damn this, and this, and this, and this!
By the way, I heard you defeated Verdia-san.
Okay, fine.
I was never particularly close to Verdia-san.
Fine. Absorb all you want.
I know Drain Touch!
I hear that it was originally some noble's villa.
Her favorite things were stuffed dolls and tales of adventurers' journeys.
Dismissed!
i1It can't be!
Scary! Scary! This is super scary! What the hell?!
and thought we could go to the bathroom together.
If you don't, my pants and the carpet in this room are going to cop something nastybe in big trouble.
Oh, hey, look! There's an empty bottle right over there!
I'm here!
Um, this is a little embarrassing,
How can anyone have so little common sense?!
This was posted as a kill quest,
So I hear.
Well, you see,
You remember that time we exorcised the cemetery in Wiz's stead?
Yes.
Kazuma! Food's ready! Get in!
I'm level 21,
Hey, I was only saying hi.
Okay...
Come right this way.
Okay...
We'll be with you in just a moment.
Please do.
i1I have nothing to feel guilty about, but...
Um, there are spaces here for the customer's condition, gender, and appearance in the dream.
i1There's something seriously wrong with the men in this city.
Yes!
Please choose whatever you like.
It's crab! Crab!
I can hardly believe that my eyes could feast on marbled red crab!
i1Oh, no!
Gimme a light!
Resting your palate? Mind if I pour myself first?
This is incredible! It's absolutely delicious!
Please give me some, too!
No. They say that children who have even a drop sell their souls for drink.
Lemme show you my newest party trick!
The mobile fortress, Destroyer!
i1Stop! Don't give me such a pure and innocent smile!
i1That's right. There was never two ways about it.
Good night, everyone.
i1I always thought she had a sexy body, but this is even better than I imagined.
Come on over here.
Wh-What are you talking about?
an8What's the matter?
Huh?!
U-Um...
Have some sense of decency.One can only be so unsensible, you know.
Wh-Why, you...
I may be naive and inexperienced, but I know when something's wrong!
Huh?
i1Wait, does that mean the Darkness lookalike in the bathroom...
I will accept my exorcism peacefully.
Kazuma has been charmed by that succubus and is under her control!
Fine.
i1Glance...
You really don't remember what happened last night, right?
Yeah, unfortunately, I don't remember a thing.
It was an accident.
Huh? Destroyer?
is approaching from the northwest on a direct course for the city.
The townspeople will lose their homes.
Hurry it up! The big boy's gonna be here any second!
I am a knight.
Lalatina.
Kazuma, you two okay over there?!
Here it comes!
I can't wait to count through my reward!
See?! What did I tell you?!
i1Excessive damage detected. Initiating self-destruct sequence.
i1All hands, evacuate immediately.
We've received so much in exchange for so little.
Kazuma-san.
we may be able to stop the self-destruct sequence.
And without a chance of turning undead.
"Has the military not even the vaguest sense of reason?
Shit, dude!
The end.
The coronatite would've done the same thing!
Now that I think about it, this city's guild issued my loans,
Hey, I don't have time to deal with you right now.
The star takes the stage.
All right, here goes!
Don't suck out too much, okay?!
I know, I know.
What was that about? Sexual harassment?
I'm trying to use Drain Touch as effectively as possible!
A little more... Just a little more.
Explosion!
And now, my adventure will begin for real!
What? You're not getting a reward?
How the heck are we going to slay the Demon King now?!
i1if I ever get another chance to go to a parallel world,
i1What's with this knight?
i1Her eyes are scaring me!
and I'm the generic starting class.
That's even better!
As such,
i1This is just too stimulating for an adolescent virgin like myself!
i1Oh, I get it.
i1She's not just hopeless. She's hopeless to the core.
I could learn to use explosion magic, too?
Exactly!
T-Token loli?
Are there any quick and easy skills?
You can't be so pushy.
They don't take many points to learn, and they're useful.
Here I go. Watch carefully.
i1Then again...
Lurk: one point.
Oh...
Okay! The thief skills you chose are now yours!I know kung fu.
Any time you're ready!
You asked for it, so don't start crying when you lose!
No! Stop! Please!
which he used to steal her panties and all the money she had.
if he'd just return my panties.
What's this?
Oh?
If a female knight like you were to be captured by the Demon Kingoh, the horror!
i1What now?
You should be the most motivated for this.
Emergency quest! Emergency quest!
they don't just sit back and let themselves be eaten.
They careen through town and meadow,
Witness my ability as a crusader with your own eyes.
Never!
Darkness, you...
i1Oh, the humiliation!
Explosion!
No, I'm just a solidly-built woman.
Just doing the healing that archpriests are supposed to do!
an8Really?
You looked almost like a skilled assassin.
but don't expect me to be much help offensively.
Once again, I look forward to working with you!
to do something so out of character?
Just one question...
Huh?
Did I die by getting plowed over by a tractor?
What's the deal with this girl I've never met before?
and even now they're laughing out loud at the cause of death.
so you can't do anything sexual, either.
So we decided, "Why not send people who've
It could be a powerful weapon or a tremendous talent.
To top it off, you can bring one thing of your choosing!
This is my gamer's intuition talking,
No matter what you pick, it's all the same.
And I died after leaving my house, so I'm not a shut-in, either!
We have heard your request.
I shall take over your job from here on out, Aqua-sama.
Hey, what is all this?
How does it feel to get dragged away with the guy you treated like a total idiot?
so if you're a goddess, use your godly powers
I don't want to go to a parallel world with a man like this!
Whoa, for real?!
Now, go forth on your journey!
What am I going to do if everyone thinks I'm friends with a crazy woman?
If you hate it that much, then you can go home.
You can call me "Goddess" if you like,
If you need job guidance, head to the counter inside.
Welcome to the gates of Hell!
Listen, Aqua.
Today we'll register with a guild and find a place to stay the night.
but I guess that's how it works in worlds like this, right?
Why did you seclude yourself every day and act like such a shut-in NEET?
In that case, you'll first need to pay the registration fee.
it'd be a huge help if you could lend me some money!
Something told me she didn't want to make eye contact with us.
Yes, thank you very much.
Average across the board,
W-Well, you can always change jobs when you level up!
but other than that, you can be anything you want!
A crusader, sword master, arch priest...
I see. It's a shame there's no "goddess" occupation,
An arch priest!
Oh, that's right!
I need you to defeat the Devil King, or I'll never be able to go home!
Say,
And so our adventure began,
So, wasn't this world supposed to be under
Yeah!
Oh, man, this is hysterical!
Thank you so much!
AnyAnything it strikes will perish!
N-Now that I've had a good look, I think frogs are pretty cute.N-Now that I have a good look, I think frogs are pretty cute.
Let's recruit more allies!
You say "allies,"
Nobody's coming.
More than half a day passed after we posted the recruitment offer,
but no prospective future heroes showed up.
You said it.
one who controls explosion magic,
the strongest of all offensive magic!
but what's with the eyepatch?
Sorry. I thought you were making fun of us.
Show us some of your former ability.
Oh, she just calls herself one. It's rather sad.
Let's back off for now and
For real.
I'm sure the path ahead of you will be thorny, but do your best!
My only desire is to use my explosion magic.
Such mighty power would be wasted on a puny party of novice adventurers like us.
I'm begging you! Please don't abandon me!
Thank you for your hard work.
I happened to see your recruitment poster.
Um...
She's such a gorgeous older woman, I got so nervous
I see. Thank goodness.
Um...
They were swallowed by Giant Toads, and the mucus
It's telling me something's up with her, just like with Aqua and Megumin.
The truth is,
Hup!
What do you think of my newly acquired skill?
First you get someone to teach you how to use a skill.
Huh? That made her happy?
Steal!
Hey! My coin pouch!
The skills you learned from me should be displayed there.
It's survival of the fittest in this world.
Where have you been?
so I said I'd pay any price
Did your stats go up with your level,
You listen up, too, Megumin.
Our opponent is the Devil King.
I shall obliterate his vile presence with the strongest of magics!
What should I do?
In fact, this concerns you most of all.
Is it a monster attack?
What the hell is this?!
in a secluded region unknown to man, without being eaten.
Wh-What?!
are looking at my skin and getting aroused!
She's enjoying it?!
It was nothing.
Have you now seen the power of the crimson demon bloodline?
I hereby confer upon you the title of "The Great Cabbage Thief."
I can use swords with either hand,
Megumin, an arch wizard;
I wouldn't have any real reason to refuse if she were a normal ally, either.
You may even abandon me as a sacrificial pawn if you wish.
Look! I repaired my armor with the reward I got for the cabbages.
What do you think?
The luster of this Manatite staff brimming with magical power...
Th-There's nothing I can do about it!
Yes.
I suddenly obtained a small fortune.
Got it! All right, I got it!
I want to test out my new staff's magic power!
No, let's do a profitable quest!
and I hear they're infesting areas near the city
If I did that, who would carry me home?
in accordance with the principles of all creation.
Burn to ashes within the crimson.
Explosion!
and yet the delayed vibrations of the air seem to strikestroke my skin.
It's a huge score!
Don't take away my reason for being!
You've got me for that! Isn't that enough?!
Most women would cry if you said what was on your mind without holding back.
I wouldn't mind if you verbally abused me instead.
All adventurers, please arm yourselves at once
Day after day, after day, after day!
Huh? M-Me?!
I have little brothers to take care of!
Megumin?
then stay in the city, trembling in fear!
don't get cocky and make my castle go boom, boom, boom, boom every single day!
When did this turn into a strategy?
I sentence thee to death.
It appears this method may actually be more effective against
tightly-knit adventurers such as yourselves.
I won't give in, but...
and demand I perform hardcore acts of perversion for him!
Okay, I'll be back!
Stop! Don't go!
and lift the curse on Darkness.
My magic should be more effective.
We'll definitely do something about your curse!
Nature's Beauty of victory!
being lauded as a chosen hero,
I want money!
The manager yells at me if any croquettes aren't sold!
I'll give it everything I've got this time!
so go find a decent-looking quest for us.
The monsters will move to a different habitat if the lake is purified,
How about it?
Huh?
simply touching the waterlake should purify it.
Hey, are we really doing this?
313 iron bars...
My ultimate explosion magic isn't to be
I won't get my reward if I give up now!
Wh-When did he become yours?!
I will slay the Devil King and save the world for you.
She's just like I used to be...
Huh? color code?
Sorry, I totally forgot!
What should I do?
That's right, you disgusting man! Coward!
This cheater with a cursed sword
who challenged a novice adventurer with weak gear to a match is the real coward!
Give back Gram!
Huh?
Come on. Come on!
No!
Eh? Uh, sure...
I-I realize this request is asking too much...
S-Satou Kazuma, where's the cursed sword?
Damn it!
This money is meaningless.
he kept calling Aqua a goddess.
Why?
You?!
Huh? What?
That's hilarious! Super hilarious!
My purification magic isn't affecting him at all!
He did go "Yah!" and all. I think it was very effective.
Slaughter everyone in the city!
Why are they all targeting me?! I'm a goddess!
What for?!
What an ideal situation!
after witnessing my explosion magic.
She's crazy in the head, and so is her name, but she pulls through when it counts!
Kazuma!
The city's ace in the hole?
Try it if you think you can!
Besides,
I'm not doing anything!
What?
I'm going to run out of magic!
Apologize!
Hurry up and do it, you useless goddess!
I'll show you what a goddess can do!
That's enough! Enough, I said!
What are you thinking?
This time, I'll steal your weapon for sure!
Leave it to me!
And Galil,
and screamed at me, saying, "Why are you charging into the swarm of monsters?!"
You're... alive?
Resurrection!
Oh, Kazuma-san, I've been waiting for you.
There may have been an old legend like that.
Ahem!
In recognition of Satou Kazuma-san's party's achievement,
Now that we've acquired great wealth,
I won't wait!
Is it a check? It's a check, right?!
The reward is 300 million,
Our bloody journey of magic
At any rate, you're far too unresourceful!
You make a goddess like myself sleep in a stable every single night!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!
Thanks to the debt you've racked up,
If we keep sleeping in that stable, I'm definitely going to freeze to death!
q2I apologize for getting carried away, so don't abandon me!
Now is the time for me to teach it which of us has
Wow.
I can catch Snow Sprites with this and bottle them up.
I caught a bunch!
Hey, are you all right?
I got eight of them.
are all absolutely stupid!
The Winter Shogun is mercifulgenerous.
If we politely apologize, he'll overlook this!
What's with this goddess?
Seriously?!
I was an adventurer,
an elite in charge of Japan, that way?!
Hey, knock it off!
The overrated Eris who's grown cocky and even became a unit of currency,
They're pads?
You have now been connected to the living world.
Huh? Oh, uh, yes!
Come on.
You were beheaded by the Winter Shogun.
Winter in this world is
A Snow Sprite?
That goddess...
Finally, so long after I came to this world, the main heroine has appeared!
Huh?
Th-The fire!
I don't have any choice!
Her name is Wiz.
Through various circumstances,
The likes of me shouldn't live in such luxury!
I'm sorry!
You sound as if you knew Verdia.
Wait! Please wait, Aqua-sama!
In fact, I should get change back!
It'll just end in us being beheaded.
Besides,
please excuse me.
so I'd appreciate it if you would let go.
You're so mean...
Is Wiz-san here?
Leave it to me!
I could ask you the same. Why are you in Aqua's room?
Hey, Megumin,
I'm going to borrow your veranda for a
Didn't you say crimson demons don't use the bathroom?!
Now, do it! Go ahead! Give it a try!
I'm here!
It's true that both our bladders are in a tough spot,
I can't go if you rush me like that!
Hurry!
What are you talking about?
Damn! We'll just have to go for it!
I'll use the Drain Touch skill I just learned and absorb the magic of as many dolls as I can!
Konosuba!
Uh-huh.
Got it?
I'm sure she won't be lonely anymore.
Oh, then toss Kazuma's tracksuit over there onto the fire!
Huh?
We acquired a mansion.
We resolved the matter of making it through winter, which had been our top concern.
Oh, it's you, Kazuma? Don't scare usme like that.
I definitely couldn't have come tointo a place like this on my own. entered
Has that actually happened to anyone?!
We also have customers who want to try it from a female perspective.
There are also those who wish to return to boyhood
Are the men in this city all right?
Oh, what about this "partner preferences"?
If you sleep too soundly, we can't show you any dreams.
in exchange for holding off on using explosion magic for the day,
That's a clever idea.
Calm down. I'm a man who's capable of self-restraint.
Just for today! What can it hurt?
Aqua, do it again! Do it again!
It's just that I drank with some friends today and don't think I can drink any more.
I'm just having them give me a dream,
This feels new in all sorts of ways.
I'm gonna go complain!
K-Kazuma?
B-But...
She's a devil who came here to attack you and steal your vitality!
I will accept my elimination,
so just pretend you don't know anything.
Have you gone mad?
All I know is that I had a nice dream.
Last night, I was controlled by a succubus.
That's the story I'm going with!
Besides, what happened clearly wasn't my fault in any way.
Like hell we're gonna let the house we finally earned,
Such a strong foe isn't supposed to come to a city of novice adventurers!
The townspeople will all lose their homes.
You're as stubborn as ever, Darkness.
I won'thave no way to know unless I try.
If you're talking about me, don't call me by that nickname!
Your explosion magic is the greatest firepower this city has.
Her true identity is an undead lich, though...
All right, everyone!
The emergency quest will now begin!
Hurry! The big one's gonna be here any second!
Hey, Darkness. I know how stubborn you are,
Given my usual behavior, it can't be helped that you would think that way,
Do you dislike selfish, stubborn allies?
Hey, Wiz!
I am strong. would be nice to make that line shake, itsP, no? he says no
I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.
Explosion!
They did it?
All crew, please evacuate immediately.
Darkness...
Besides, when I think about exposing myself to
Will I be able to withstand it?
I'll be back!
but he passed away peacefully, with no lingering attachments.
"This country's bigshots made an unreasonable request.
They asked about a power source, too, but what do I care?
All done. As of this moment, it's going on a rampage.
but what do we do with this?
Now, then...
Is this where you were, Darkness?
Its internally-stored heat is escaping?
At this rate, the city will become a sea of flames!
Wait!
Konosuba!
You're sexually harassing me in this state of emergency?!
She's not going to detonate, is she?
Frenzied blaze clad in night...
when it comes to explosion magic!
This good-for-nothing world,
Knights are coming from the imperial capital!
With this, my adventure will begin at last!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma.
What?!
Hey, what's the meaning of this?!
Just how many cabbages do you think I caught?!
W-Well...
Most of what you caught is actually lettuce.
an8Th-There's nothing I can do about it!
i1Crap, she's coming this way. Danger radar.
I've thought this for a while now, but you're, um...
In fact, I assumed I'd be rolling in dough,
Shut up, you useless goddess!
Thanks, honey, come again!
No, let's do one with a huge reward!
Am not.
Hey, why not do it here?
though I promulgate the laws of nature,
an8Explosion!
i1Megumin unleashed her magic upon that abandoned castle every day.
I'm sure you will.
The chef said I could take these leftovers home from the kitchen!
All you're good for is party tricks!
an8Meanie! Demon! Brute!
Just about any girl would cry if you spoke your mind to them.
I wouldn't mind if you verbally abused me instead.
Emergency! Emergency!
i1was somewhat peeved with us.
I have two little brothers to look after!
I am Megumin!ily never change megumin
Are you making a fool of me?
I am a crimson demon, and the greatest magician in this town!
Shh! Do her a favor and keep quiet!
Stop bullshitting me!
Darkness! Darkness!
It seems I'm unharmed.
Watch as your friend suffers, and condemn yourself with remorse for your actions.
I won't give in to a mere curse!
Don't stop me!
Stop casting explosion spells on my castle!
But I hear there's a bunch of undead in the castle.
Well? I can be pretty priestly sometimes, don't you think?
It's no big deal! Even though it was!
All citizens, evacuate at once!
The Destroyer was created by an ancient magical kingdom, correct?
I wonder where he went.
No, they can't.
Why is she so famous?
She made a name for herself as a master arch wizard once upon a time.
Lala What was that?
Don't tell the others.
I am a knight.
I-It's huge! no k-time here pls
Kazuma, are you okay over there?!
Hey, hey, it's too soon! Too soon!
You did it, Megumin.
All crew, please evacuate immediately.
It can't be done!
We're evacuating!
No, no matter how sturdy I may be, it's unlikely I'll get through this unscathed.
I'm going for it!
In fact, after all the inexpensive hospitality I've received...
Yeah!
I want to go home!
Is thatthis his diary?
Konosuba!
Wh-What is it?
What a letdown...
I see.
The stone's gone pastsurpassed red, and is shining white now!
Understood.
and it's still detecting the savory aroma of danger.
What's that?!
Hey, I thought we removed the coronatite!
Hey, you self-proclaimed something-or-other.
No! I'm not trying to sound like some performer!
You're sexually harassing me in this state of emergency?!
All else aside,
I don't want to be outdone by anyone else
Huh?!
That's the sort of good-for-nothing world this is.
Oh, God.
Being lauded as the chosen hero...
We need a quest!
Please kill both of them.
killing unnecessary.
This quest was made for me!
Help me out, Kazuma-san!
I think I've got a way for you to purify the lake safely.
Seems that way.
You know, you're being awfully quiet today.
Usually, you'd say something fantasitic
It's going well!
Purification! Purification! Purifica
Aqua?
Miss Aqua?
Take me back to town like this.
q2We're getting enough funny looks as it is, carting around a woman on her knees in a beat-up cage.
She's completely holed herself up in there.
Do something!
yet you make the goddess Aqua-sama sleep in a stable.
i1This guy got that "Cursed Sword Gram" or whatever when he was reincarnated
i1Also, these girls are "excellent"?
My mind cannot accept this man's merevery existence.
Can I blow him up? Can I please blow him up?yes bby
Um,
Bye, then.
Wait!
If I win, turn the goddess Aqua-sama over to me.
If you win, I'll listen to any one request you have.
Steal!
You two in this guy's party?
i1Or this cheater with a cursed sword picking on a noob with starter equipment?
No!
after deducting the cost of the broken cage, is 100,000 eris.
The next time I see that jerk,
Hey, wait! Tell me who's spreading that around!
O great Aqua-sama,
God Blow!
It's 300,000! 300,000!
Oh, uh, sure.
Yes, I am the goddess Aqua!
Huh?
Why haven't you come to the castle?!Match to E5
Don't act innocent, you damned son of a bitch!
That crazy crimson demon girl
with no idea that we dispelled his curse like a cinch the moment he left!
Not when they're all moving everywhere.
All right, then, as promised...
i1What do we do?
...you'll have to make do!
As one whose calling is to protect others,
Is this the best shaming the demon army can muster?
Nothing, damn it!
Th-That's not it! This isn't some weird foreplay!
Stop that, you pests!
Create Water!
i1Retarded bitch!
I can use flood-class water magic.
Apologize for calling a water goddess a "lame goddess"!
Hurry up and do it, you useless goddess!
You just called me a useless goddess!
G-Get your filthy hands off me, you perverted knight!
What are you thinking?
but a beginning adventurer's Steal
Oh?
You can hit me with it if you want, but only if you can!"
an8Resurrection! Resurrection! Resurrection!
Now you can have that drink together!
I've been waiting for you, Kazuma!
No, wait, that isn't what I...
That's right! If you weren't here,
I award you 300 million eris.
Um, Kazuma-san...
Of course, defeating a leader of the Demon King's army is a big accomplishment,
so I won't insist you pay back the full sum.
but today, I remarkably made up my mind to go out.
What about the girl I pushed out of harm's way?
She's alive.
You mistakenly thought a truck ran over you.
I died of shock?!
Your family rushed to the hospital,
Damn her!
You have two choices:
To tell you the truth,
so you can't do anything sexual, either.
On the other hand, starting over from zero isn't so fun, either.
Slaughter!
That won't be an issue.
we'll overload your brain so you'll be able to learn it instantly.
So all that leaves you to do is to choose a powerful ability or piece of equipment.
Yes, you did.
I'll grant you one power that is second to none!
Not like that matters, just hurry it up.
Hey, what is all this?
This is not right!
If you do so, we shall grant
Whoa, for real?!
No!
It's a parallel world.
I get it, okay?! I'm sorry!
Hey, calm down, Goddess.
Hey, wait.
Hey!
Oh, we've actually come a long way, and we just got into town.
If you're lookin' for the guild admission desk, it's over there.
There goes your reliability, just like that.
Yes, the object of worship for the Religious Order of Axis: the goddess Aqua!
By the way, Eris is a goddess ranked beneath me.
A believer in my subordinate took pity on me
Something told me she didn't want to make eye contact with us.
Did I?
We didn't come here to be laborers.
With no monsters, there's no need for anyone to give us any fetch quests.
bord3.5As long as you have me around, it'll be over in a flash!
basically insignificant, job-hopping part-timers.
Even in a country as wealthydeveloped as Japan,Even in a place as affluent as Japan,
Good morning.
This is the furthest city from the Devil King's castle.
All right! Let's put together the most basic equipment we can get and head out.
You look super desperate!
Giant Toads.
I guess I have no choice.
In return, you'd better worship me from tomorrow onward!
Thank you, Kazuma!
If it gets out that I backed down from a lowly frog,
Feel the power of the gods!
Oh?
but I'm still in the weakest class.
I happened to notice your recruitment poster.
My name is Megumin!
the strongest of all offensive magic!
Um...
My lethal magic demolishes mountains,
It's an advanced job class that commands powerful offensive magic!
So this is magic?
I stink! I stink!
Just do your best with some other magic from now on.
I can't use any other type of magic.
For real.
Even I didn't learn all the arch priest spells
What the heck would you use "party trick" skills for?
My only desire is to use my explosion magic.
I'd be fine with going unpaid if need be.
All right, I get it!
It's so not worth it.
Are you still recruiting party members?
A female knight.
What's with this woman knight?
this is a bit difficult for me to say,
Stay calm. Don't be seduced by her womanly charms!
What do you think of my newly acquired skill?
Basically, if I have you teach me,
Actually, is there any other skill more worthwhile to learn?
Huh?
He thinks I'm a little girl?
Looks like my intentions didn't get through to her at all!
Shall we continue where our conversation left off last night?
So,
A high tuition fee, huh?
Use your adventurer card and acquire the skill.
Steal: one point.
Oh...
Yeah, I won't need this.
Come at me anytime!
Wow!
her panties were stripped off, then all the money she had on her was taken.
You're not wrong, but seriously, hold on!
No, thanks.
All right, I guess I can play that card.
For you in particular, Darkness.
Didn't they say? It's cabbage. Cabbage!
Harvest time!
Bring out the mayonnaise!
What the hell is this?!
Go!
If that's the case,
let's catch as many as possible,
Darkness, you...
I refuse to accept this.
Thank you.
and Darkness, a crusader.
I wouldn't have any real reason to refuse if she were a normal ally, either.
as a decoy or wall anytime from now on.
Now that I've learned a skill, maybe I'm a bit more of an adventurer.
Look! I repaired my armor with the reward I got for the cabbages.
Just how many cabbages do you think I caught?!
q2About how much was your reward from our last quest?
fairly cool, you know?
You're real scum.
Just enough to pay my tab is plenty!
Shut up, you useless goddess!
Let's go on a kill quest right away, then.
Huh?
A thrilling adventure in a parallel world, huh?
Just use your magic on whatever and let's go back.
I'll use that!
though I promulgate the laws of nature,
How about some, ma'am? And you, too, mister!
On cold, rainy evenings...
On calm, early afternoons, right after lunch...
I kept close, observing her magic,
Meanie! Demon! Brute!
and gather at the front gate of the city, ready for battle!
Hey, what's going on?
I'm the leader from the Devil King's army
Why are you looking at me?
I don't want to die yet!
If you don't have the nerve,
Very well.
You're too late!
for the next week and repent for your actions.
However, will you all really be able to make it that far?
That means weapons won't work very well.
Don't...
So rest assured
Hup!
This money is meaningless.
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
P-Please!
Will Aqua be all right?
The monsters will move to a different habitat if the lake is purified,
The reward is 300,000 eris."
Who do you think I am?
Five minutes?
Help me out, Kazuma-san!
Huh?
We'll reel you in, cage and all!
You'll catch a chill if you're in the water too long!
You two insist you don't use the bathroom,
Just take me back like this.
The world outside this cage is scary.
It looks like a quest traumatized Aqua yet again.
Can we beat that thing?
I was the sort of ordinary high schooler you could find anywhere,
My Goddess.
In fact, get out of there already!
The outside world is scary, so I won't come out for a while.
My Goddess!
The Mitsurugi Kyouya who received this Cursed Sword Gram
Then you locked her in a cage and dunked her in a lake?!
W-Wait!
but you are a goddess!
I see. You're blessed with wonderful party members.
Bye, then.
What now? He's the type that won't listen to anyone.
That'll teach you to say whatever you please.
I'll unleash my Steal ability right here in public.
Konosuba!
I wasn't even the one who broke it...
Aqua-sama,
Didn't she say 200,000 earlier?
I sold it.
You wretches!
What? no edit
Why?
Huh?!
Huh? What?
No, it looked pretty effective to me.
There's no need for me to fight you myself.
M-My eyes! My eyes!
He did go "Yah!" and all. I think it was very effective.
That's enough!
Megumin!
Megumin, have your magic on stand by!
Amusing...
Yeah! It doesn't matter if he's a leader in the Devil King's army or not!
We can create a blind spot if we all attack at once.
That is absolute!
Besides,
He's been shaving away at my armor
he's left only parts of my armor intact,
Kazuma!
Are you an idiot?
This time, I'll steal your weapon for sure!
I may be weakened,
Hey, you guys! Let's play soccer!
Hit me with it if you want, but only if you can!"You can hit me with it if you want, but only if you can!" double can?
and screamed at me, saying, "Why are you charging into the swarm of monsters?!"
They were all slain by that dullahan.
I'd love to have a drink with them.
Shh! She'll hear you.
No, wait, that isn't what I
Actually, I have a special reward for you and your party.
Who knew you'd defeat a leader of the Devil King's army?
In recognition of Satou Kazuma-san's party's achievement,
and earn the title of strongest wizard.
You're going to go back to being a shut-in NEET?
Don't "huh" me, you useless goddess!
Huh?
Can you even wrap your slut mouth around how much gets deducted
I'm sorry! I was completely out of line, so please, don't abandon me!
But considering the situation...
The time has come for me to demonstrate which of us
I read the monster's name and thought, "Friends, sure. Enemies, hell no."
i1Whatever! I want money!
You look like a dumb kid going bug-catching in the middle of winter.
If we pour drinks in here with them,
Now!
i1What the heck?
General Winter is merciful.
Huh?
only to befall such a fate.
and provide for you a life of comfort.
I-If possible,
but now I feel like I pulled through by the skin of my teeth.
Because my life up until now has been total shit!
You said it!
and a masochistic, perverted crusader who couldn't hit a wall at point blank.
I thought Japan's balance was shit, but this world...balance as in game balance? kinda hard to bring that across without sounding like engrish imoeh it's relatable to many natural and societal balances so this is fine
i1Maybe I even kinda liked it.
i1I wish I could've adventured with those girls a little longer.
Get your butt back here, Kazuma!
Yes?
F-Fine! Fine!
I'll open the gate right now!
Kazuma!
Don't you have something to say?
H-How was I killed?
He even has a name!
I'll pet you and love you,
i1She mourned my death with a gentle gaze
Huh?
That money was to get us through the winter!
or one with repulsive tentacles?
the season turned to winter.
You should exalt me more!
Wait! I'm sorry!
q2I apologize for getting carried away, so don't abandon me!
was distributed to every adventurer who participated.
There's no reason for anyone to go hunting dangerous winter monsters
There are lots of Snow Sprites in the snowy plains.
look so happy?
Hey, can't you do something about that outfit?
Number three, wait!
and take their form.
What is it?!
prostrated herself quite magnificently, indeed.
only for this to happen to you...
Seriously?!
This is a reward for trying my hardest, right?
P-Please wait a moment!
you can't be revived again!
Huh? What goddess is spouting that nonsense?
Where does a goddess in charge of a backwater like this get off talking to me,
Aqua-senpai is as unreasonable as ever.
I don't mind if they're pads.
This normally never happens, you know.
This is...
What're you blushing for? Say something!
H-How was I killed?
I'm going to take this one home and make it a refrigerator!
I won't let you kill it!
Oh, fine.
I wonder what I should choose.
She mourned my death so much
Finally, so long after I came to this world, the main heroine has appeared!
What's with you?
Huh?
What's the problem?
If we run out of money, we can just accept another quest.
So cold...
Wait!
Oh, I-I'm sorry!
Her name is Wiz.
Although Wiz is a lich, she's a kind girl.
It's delicious.
Stop acting like a spiteful sister-in-law.
I was thinking it could be a great asset in battle if I could learn skills like that.
This conversation isn't going anywhere.
saying you're a leader of the Devil King's army...
He said he wouldn't stop me from quietly managing my shop in a human settlement,
So, as long as you're around,
I still have something I need to do.
Now, hold on.
It'll just end in us being beheaded.
Whenever I would walk around...
My hand slipped!
Here I go! Hi-yah!
Um...
It's a skill that absorbs an opponent's health and magic,
it might be able to compensate for our party's lack of firepower.
O-Okay then,
No, we're not getting anywhere, so let her absorb it!
It's all right. You can let go of my hand now.
so I'd appreciate it if you would let go.
A-Aqua-sama?
Ow!
Is Wiz-san here?
The girl remained in the mansion and succumbed
so all that's left is to wait for nighttime.
The girl's name was Anna Filante Estheroid.
Having my own room is a wonderful thing!
What's wrong?! Hey, Aqua, what happened?!
Kazuma!
This is super expensive alcohol that I've been saving.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Huh? Was there a doll like that in this room?
I'm the one who should be saying that!
I could ask you the same. Why are you in Aqua's room?
Now, do it! Go ahead! Give it a try!
I won't let you!
so could you sing a song or something in a loud voice?
Please don't rush me like that!
What are you talking about?
You want to blow away this mansion along with them?!
H-Hey, Aqua, are you all right?!
and settled in that vacant mansion instead.
So... I... did...
Who would've thought it was all true?
I'm sure.
the down-to-earth lifestyle I most desired.
Even when faced with obscene mental attacks
Darkness! That's not fair!
I'm level 21,
Huh?
We resolved the matter of making it through winter, which had been our top concern.
Welcome!
Please come this way.
I can hardly wait.
Occupation... Artisan Weaver?
Sir?
Oh, yes.
Well, then, I will explain.
Has that actually happened to anyone?!
It can be anything or anyone,
Oh, not that I intend to ask for that sort of thing.
That's true!
Oh, also, please be careful not to drink too much this evening, okay?
I'm back.
They said it's to thank their daughter's party members for always looking out for her!
Is it that luxurious?
in exchange for holding off on using explosion magic for the day,
I would restrain myself with pleasure
Just place a shell filled with crab innards here, and...
Not going to drink? I'll go first, then.
Just for today! What can it hurt?
Everyone drink up!
Art isn't something you can just show off when asked.
Tomorrow. I'll have some tomorrow.
I felt drowsy earlier and closed my eyes.
AMy dream?!
No, um, uh... I have so many questions that my brain can't quite keep up.
Is it me? Am I the one with no common sense?
so it's nice seeing you shy and embarrassed for a change.
C-Come on, that's enough, right?
totally...
An intruder got caught in my barrier, and now she's immobilized...
Wait, was that "Darkness" I ran into in the bathroom...
Just resign yourself.
Kazuma, if you don't want us to beat you into submission,
I'll slaughter you!
Fine.
A convenient explanation fell into my lap,
Wh
no matter how mighty the enemy.
Like hell we're gonna let the house we finally earned,
is on a direct path our way, invading from the northwest.
Aside from that,
We have that.
Her true identity is an undead lich, though...
Right!
Lala What was that?
Protecting the livelihoods of my countrymen is both my duty and my honor.
but I don't mind when someone like you is selfish.
Don't call me by that name!
Kazuma, are you okay over there?!
Hey! Is your love for explosion magic the real deal?!
Is your explosion magic so wimpy, it can't even destroy that thing?!
Explosion!
You idiot! Why do you love clichs like that?!
Huh?!
It's no use.
We're evacuating!
Huh? Hey!
Kazuma-san.
It's open!
Absurd."
Still, I feel kind of relieved. I'm satisfied.
but what do we do with this?
The coronatite is out of control.
What's with that self-serving, wild idea?
Um, Kazuma-san...
Thank you!
I should be able to use teleportation magic now!
I see.
Hey, this isn't good!
It's okay. I'll take responsibility.
What's that?!
so if it were to go boom right now...
Hey, you self-proclaimed something-or-other.
I'm going to share your magical power with Wiz
she'll definitely disappear!
Megumin!
That's the god of party tricks' lead-in, right?
I can't believe I get to use explosion magic twice in a day
Hey! Not you, too!
This might be bad. It's bad.
Oh, blackness shrouded in light...
With this, my adventure will begin at last!
My next adventure is calling me.
What're we gonna do?!
Hey, everyone. We're going to the guild.
Hey, you.
I won'thave no way to know unless I try.
Even so, couldn't you at least try it?
S-Sure...
We have that.
That's right. The crazy one!
right here and now!
but that, at the very least, is how I feel.
A certain arch priest's selfish whims
but I don't mind when someone like you is selfish.
You just said the one thing
Come on, let's go back and celebrate!
I wonder how much the reward will be!
Huh?!
Initiating self-destruct sequence.
A knight mustn't run away before her countrymen.
Huh?
I see! She intends to destroy it before it can explode!
I'm going for it!
Don't be scared! We'll follow her, too!
He totally looks like he died a solitary, lonesome death...
They asked about a power source, too, but what do I care?
They actually brought it! What should I do?
What a letdown...
Teleport!
Wait!
Konosuba!
I'm ready anytime.
That's the god of party tricks' lead-in, right?
Yeah, yeah.
I thought my heart was going to stop!
Frenzied blaze clad in night...
All else aside,
Here I go!
That was one long tutorial.
That's right. Nothing goes the least bit as I expect it.
It's freezing.
Th-The fire!
Yo, Wiz. It's been a while.
Clumsy as ever.
You're undead, and you have the nerve to set up a shop.
You're undead, and you have the nerve to serve hot tea.
But people don't normally get a chance to learn lich skills, right?
so when I heard that she's the head goddess of the Axis sect...
That's quite a feat.
Wait! Please wait, Aqua-sama!
With this, all my debts will be forgiven!
Heck, I'll even have money to spare!
and there's no bounty for defeating me, either!
I'll end up getting beheaded again.
But are you okay with this?
I believe my heart is human, even now.
Oh?
It's a skill that absorbs an opponent's health and mana,
i1I can't tell which is the lich and which is the goddess.
O-Okay,
please excuse me.
You think I'll let her suck anything out of me?!
Excuse me!
The shame of a noble who made a move on one of his maids, through fifty shades of grey,
an8As much as I'd like to lampoon you for digging up this much backstory detail...
We've decided the rooms and brought in our luggage.
This is great!
Having my own room is a wonderful thing!
It was empty!
i1Wait, since when was there a doll in this room?
Scary! Scary! This is super scary! What the hell?!
What are you suggesting I do with that empty bottle?!
Please don't rush me!
Hurry!
You'll blow the whole mansion away!
So I hear.
Well, you see,
there's a public cemetery near that mansion.
So the spirits had nowhere to go and settled in that vacant mansion instead.
Excuse us a moment.
Uh-huh.
We won't accept the special reward from the guild.
Not at all. I personally think this was for the best.
I'm begging you, please don't cause any more mischief.
Got it! Coming!
Darkness! That's not fair!
Relinquish that couch to me, the exalted Aqua.
Huh?
My stats were obviously maxed out from the very start!
Looks like I have no choice but to use my deadly teleport.
Hey, wait.
Welcome to the gates of Hell!Match to E1
Y-Yes?
Well, then, I will explain how things work.
...and this puts a great deal of stress on a male.
Please fill in this questionnaire sheet with details of your desired dream.Please write your order for your desired dream on this questionnaire sheet.
For reals?!
an8Aqua, Aqua, what does it taste like?
Watch my fingers!
i1Not when you normally blurt out nothing but nasty stuff that creeps me out!
an8Please! Just once!
i1Crap, my heart is racing.
i1The lantern went out?
Yo.
You can start by washing my back.
Ah... Huh?
Back please. Come on.
Wh-Why, you...
but you should still know what comes next!
I may be naive and inexperienced, but I know when something's wrong!
I didn't ask for a blue-balling!
Even in my dreams, she gets in my way!
Hey, Aqua!
Hold still and let us annihilate you.
B-But...
What's the big idea?
Go.
Fine.
i1Last night, I was placed under a succubus's spell.
You need to learn how to be a decent, normal person.
Huh? Destroyer?
Hey, guys, let's get to the guild.
is approaching from the northwest on a direct course for the city.
Um...
i1These things should stay in high-level areas where they belong!
Then, if we could hit it with some kind of powerful offensive magic...
Given my usual behavior, I can see why you would assume that.
Oh, uh, sure...
It makes me want to slap her silly.
You're really up for this, right?!
Oh, I get it! Your Explosion's so wimpy that it can't even blow that pile of scrap up!
I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.
Hi, I'm Kazuma.
I'm going in!
I see! She intends to destroy it before it can explode!
Me too. I'm long past level 30, but...
I remember now why I still hang around this starting city.
We've received so much in exchange for so little.
Let's go home. We can come back tomorrow.
Take a look at that.
A battle-ready mobile fortress on this pittance?From a whole kingdom's taxes, only this?
Absurd."
I'll spend the rest of my life right here.
H-Hey! Kazuma-san's turning into a skeleton!
Oh, good.
My feet are on fire!
Touch.
I felt a little under the weather!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm trying to use Drain Touch as effectively as possible!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma.
Huh?!
I, the totally completely perfect angel, make my entry.
I need to hack through this boring dull night.
known to no one, a secret keyword.
it's embarrassing.
You're not the only one.
Let's chat again.
From the very beginning.
Part A
i1The temperature will be extremely high today. It's going to be a sunny day.
Master! Look, Master! Let's buy this! C'mon, are you listening?
Crap! Come back to me... Please live!
i1Why is this happening to me?
No, this is no good... Let's try here!
Are you kidding me?! This computer is my life!
Hang in there! You can do it!
Once we buy that keyboard, let's go there, just for a bit, okay?
C'mon, Master!
You, sir, are a gentleman.
Don't lay it on too thick. Just forget that folder ever existed.
No way in hell!
Forget it! If you dropped that from that high up, it'd kill somebody!
S-Sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going.
Master... Um, how should I say this...
Enough, already!
Master?
I know!
Okay, good work.
i1We have seized this entire floor.
i1Well, I guess I'm not entirely helpless...
i1No, what the hell am I thinking?!
Wh-Where did you come from?!
A-Are you messing with me?
Wouldn't dream of it!
Anyway, our hands are tied and we're surrounded, so there's nothing we can do.
How about this, then?
It certainly is.
Okay, here's your big chance.
It's all up to you now, Ene!
I'm speechless!
A wedding dress?
Yeah, but Father said he'd definitely come with us!
She was probably planning on using Tsukihiko to attack the village.
Eye of awakening.
If you won't tell me, I'll just look for myself.
C'mon, we don't want to have to hurt you.
Azami...
What? Why are you sticking up for that monster?
Hey, someone found guide marks leading into the forest!
Please, don't...
Leave.
No! Don't go, Mother!
Aw...
i1Even when Father died, and even when Marry was born,
Let go of that child this instant!
Your wish has been fulfilled at last, has it not?
That ego of yours gives us the greatest pleasure.
However...
to swallow up those who die on August 15th,
Farewell, my master.
What am I gonna do?
What's that? A girl?
i1I'm lonely... It's lonely to be alone.
Are you okay?!
Uh...
Oh, I nodded off...
Here you are!
It's really strange, huh?
Of course!
I can't believe it! What in the world is going on?
I shall give you the fantasy you desire,
i1I am your power.
Join the Blindfold Gang, Hibiya!
It seems like that snake is trying to grant the desire of Dad's heart.
Th-That's great news!
You've met Takane and Haruka, right?
Like that'll happen!
So don't worry about me, okay?
Sis...
Understand?
Do you really expect me to say, "Sure, I won't kill anyone," just because you asked nicely?
If that's the case...
Don't do it! Sis!
I'm the one who's keeping your dear dad alive.
At least give us our dad back!
I can't bring back this man's wife.
I should just reset everything.
You...!
The person who's keeping you and your family alive is yours truly.
In that case, starting today, you'll support us all as our Commander!
Got it! Starting today, you're Commander Kido!
Kido's really trying hard to
Not really.
If you say so... You don't seem like your usual self though.
Let go of me, I said!
Hey, where are you going?!
I get the feeling I can do it if it's to save my friends.
I thought I might sing a little.
And I'll cheer you up while I'm at it.
Damn it!
Outro
Come on, no more fighting alone.
Everyone's waiting.
Anyway, would it kill you to let me in on things beforehand?
Yes?
But he's, like, Haruka's complete opposite.
I don't know what it is, but it's hard to believe he's the same person.
But your personality's a lot different now too, isn't it?
Speaking of which, where the hell is he?
I-I guess he flaked out on us.
My brother's a loser, after all.
Just kidding.
You didn't do a darn thing, Ene. Neither did Seto.
Let go! Let go of me, dammit!
Always sticking your clueless noses where they don't belong.
Wall.
Well, not exactly.
You!
Wh-What?
Th-That sounds like a sketchy ability...
This isn't the time for that! Same goes for you, Kano.
What were you thinking?!
S-Sorry.
Her prayer in the last loop was a thing of beauty.
Full marks for you!
Your master's wish will be granted too, right?
Th-That boy, Konoha... Where is he?
Relive this never-ending, ultimate nightmare one more time!
One more time!
Don't try to stop me!
That's my line.
Thank you, me of this world.
The future isn't to be feared.
Yes... I'm really happy.
No, my bad.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.
i1If I went back to that time, it's possible that a future like that could have happened.
i1Even that one summer day that was so dazzling...
bord0This isn't the time to have your head in the clouds
All right! Bring it on!
Wh-What is it, Ayumoron?
Among girls, the back is considered part of the chest.
Jesus!oo wut?
Geez.
I'll bet Nessie lives here!
but that would be speaking too highly of you.until honto ni, join with prev if this line has too little time
Don't tell me she really found Nessie...
Whoa, boy! Whoa, boy!
Why don't we go for a swim together?
The string on her swimsuit is coming undone!
Why?!
i1because they didn't want me to bother those two while they were playing.
But no matter what you do,
I'm sure she'll love my present the most.
Sure.
M-May I come too?
I got a great idea!
Huh?
Seraphim asked me to deliver these.
i1I wasn't planning on it.
You jerk!
i1Would you mind taking Madame Hellscythe somewhere else until our preparations are complete?
The Pot of Darkness is great, Big Bro!
A-Actually, we got something special ready for you today.
It's a gorgeous mushroom hamburger, made with 100 pure minerals.
Haruna, this is no time for kidding around!
Here's a hint:
Correct!
Or the bronze rope?
Anyway, let's eat the cake.
But ever since you guys started feeding him, he's become really attached to you all.
i1Although most people don't realize it,
i1it looks like it's our fate to deal with those forbidden secrets.
i1And yes, I'm one of the chosen few.
bord4Aikawa Ayumu is a zombie who was raised from the dead by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe.
sign?
Whoa, you look parched!
Anderson, you're so cool.
Aikawa, you're so lame.
I'm Seraphim, a vampire ninja.
Stop it, Kanami.
ehhh?But these are the crowning touches to my cooking!
You first, Hiramatsu.
That's inspiring.
I stay late every day,
i1Who would be here so late at night?
i1It couldn't be...
Eyecatch1
Uh, no. It's Aikawa.
Say something like, "Oh no! I've fallen!"
I feel like I can talk to you about anything...
Must've been a fairy.
You made an imaginary friend?
Don't you think he looks like Aikawa?
There's no way someone could be that messed up.
Oh, I can't take it any more.
You bastard! You're no ordinary human!
Let's go, my AAA-class Megalo friend!
Haruna?!
But Hiramatsu...
Here I come!
It's that cross-dresser from the graveyard!
I got a glimpse under his skirt. He really is wearing panties!
No way! Unbelievable!
i1I love you, my darling piece of shit!
Hehe!
That's not it! Hear me out!
bord3blur0.5it's time for Aikawa Ayumu to return to the battle known as everyday life.
What is it?
However cruel it may be.
and I realized that you're pretty cool after all.
Hey!
Aikawa... Your legs were really pretty...
Oh, thank goodness you're here today!
I don't really understand why, but my life is moving in a direction I never wanted it to!
Mountains, huh? Sounds good.
Are you trying to escape reality?
What I really want right now is to go somewhere quiet, with no people around.
And Tomonori said...
I can be reborn, free of the world's delusions.
Hey, Aikawa!
C'mon, are we there yet?!
Toilet break!
From where we're headed, they'll be even more beautiful!
I'm looking forward to it.
Is that so? You've certainly gone to great lengths for him.
Th-That's not it!
I come here every year!
Oh, really?
Shouldn't we be worrying about why she's taking so long?
Are you hugging
Aikawa!
Aikawa!
I said, I can't see!
Actua
blur0.5It's more fun when everyone's together.
Let's all come here again next year, Ayumu!
Don't be greedy, Maelstrom.
and welcome the new me of today.
Okay, okay.
You moron!
He understood my feelings!
I'm me!
Sure, people see me differently after I flashed the whole school,
The fact that my best friend is a crossdressing pervert,
Okay.
Aren't we supposed to be friends forever?
Worry not. I would never mistreat you.
This is awesome!
See how wonderful my darling is!
Together, we're Double-Eu!
Nor do I care about his looks, of course.
Limit?
has just reached a whole new level!
The miso soup is ready.
Let's eat!
Please don't talk to me right now, you piece of shit.
I wanted to ask you about fixing Mystletainn.
That's right. It's not yet a third of the way through.
These things take time. Everyone in Virie knows that!Check sp of Virie
Oh well!
But before that, gimme more food!
EuDon't squirm or you'll get hurt.
I'm home!
That's right. I can see how the beak will spin,
Later. I need to concentrate on this right now.
Magical energy leaked from there and interfered with the super-dimensional inductors around it.Fuck this show
They don't call me the Genius Baroness of Darkness for nothing!
Did they fix Mystletainn?
I never thought I'd miss seeing you like that.This is one time I miss seeing you like that.As in, usually she considers that getup an eyesore, but this time she's seeing it after so long
Orito?
More time?
What... are you talking about?
Obito is trying to overcome his prejudices and adapt to this new world.
an8I'll say it again!
But say I feel like drinking liquor afterward.
That's what I lack! Courage!
I'm suffocating!
A vampire ninja's supposed to always remain in shadow.
Okay! I got it!
We were just getting to the good part!
Don't get burned by my heat, bro!
All the bad guys are my homies.
I want to dance like that too.
Outta my way, ho!
OritoI love you!
Can't breathe...
Just call for me if you remember anything, okay?

That's why Toshiro
I'm not okay with it!
Welcome home, Master!
This caf is one such means to that end.
Kirara!
You fool! Don't call them tights!
You piece of shit voyeur who came to ogle girls in costume.

Huh?!
Wait, I won?
Hmph! Stop staring!
What's the matter, Orito?
Did you finally lose it?
horaSteady.
Drink my water!
S-Seconds please.
What a shrewd, calculating fighter!
Th-That was just a bonus stage!
Captain! Mihara Kanami!
Aikawa!
I'm never going to wash this hand again.
Yeah, let's have some.
Yeah, you're right!
Thanks, Eu.
i1It's not like I want to touch Eu while she's all hot and sweaty!
i1I've reached enlightenment.
i1I can do it!
But... But...
Fever?
It's ready!
Whether they're from here or the Underworld,
everyone wants their friends and family close by when things get tough.
What is it?
And I just got hold of what I needed...
Sorry!
What do you think I am?
at least when she's suffering.
Yo, good morning.
I'm fine! Thanks for worrying about me, Big Bro!
And yet, given that she hasn't fully recovered even after a day of rest...
What's wrong?
Tangerine pith is poisonous to Underworld denizens like us.
Bah! We'll try everything we can!
I also heard of a cure where you bathe in water covered with soy flour at 46C for 36 minutes.
Sorry, Haruna.
I'll lay out a futon for you.
She was probably just trying to make sure we didn't worry about her as well.
You perverted piece of shit!

Hello. Would this be Ayumu?
Ms. Haruna!
i1Furthermore, Haruna's so obsessed with the cultural festival that she got to Orito as well.
Then, it's decided.
i1Before I knew it, the cultural festival was only a day away.
Are you okay?
T-Take this.
Aikawa!
Yep.
Yes, sir.
Let's go home.
C'mon, you're exaggerating.
This is what they call youth!
i1and welcome the new me of today.
To my stall!
i1Do you intend to strike me down once again into the abyss of despair?!
Master...
"I'll be waiting under the tree behind the school building."
But there's nobody here.
Oh right, I heard that this the most popular place for confessions in the school.
Now I understand why you wore that wedding dress and chose this confession spot!
It's too early!
No!
Double Mystletainn kick!
Yeah!
Haruna See, Necromancer totally gets it!
Haruna just answered that question.
OP starts here
Oh, Universe! Behold, and watch carefully!
O-Okay.
Oh? No costume today?
You gave it to me, so it's my duty as your wife to wear it forever.
Yuki!
So, it's a special ring.
Haruna Hurry up and get fantasizing already!
Haruna The headaches are all its fault!
We'll go looking around the stalls.
Haruna, would you like a crepe?
Haruna Necromancer, you're such a bully.
I understand.
Seraphim.
That hot "toilet ghost" look... That's you all over, Sera!
What are you doing in the girls' line?
i1Htaed...
Huh? Everyone else can see her too?
You must be pretty famous if even Haruna knows your name.
What's more, the only way I could temporarily loosen the curse was to get drunk.
everything I needed finally came together.
N-No way... This morning we ran out of toilet paper because...
There's no freakin' way
i1Noitaredom ni knird, ylbisnopser lohocla yojne!

For instance, if she does this...
Don't look at me, you piece of shit!
No, you can't!

As if anyone'd be your buddy!
Really? That's too bad.
Is there any way we can take Haruna's magic back from her?
What are you talking about?
Come on, guys! Don't look at me like that!
Letting a murderer roam free...
From the King of the Night.
From the King of the Night...

What? Gross!

He's trying so hard that I'd feel bad if I didn't go.
All that matters is my mission.
Saras!
What? You're not going?
Yay!
Men.
Women.
I'm your host, Aikawa Ayumu!
Pretty cool.
But the Internet told me this was sexy!
If there's one thing Magiclad Girls love, it's a party!
i1If you do anything weird to her, I won't forgive you.
q2Eu, you're the only one who understands what I'm going through.
Let's play the King's Game!
euThe King's orders are absolute.
So, this is the King's Game.
It's just a game, after all.
Oh, no! That'd be so embarrassing!
It's okay, Aikawa. I don't mind if it's you.
This is just a game.
Please, pardon my late arrival!
Your heart is a half-boiled egg!
No, not at all! I'm here for another reason, but don't worry about it, okay?
Kyouko, you can't fight here.
i1Gnimrahc...
i1dna Ylevol!
I wonder...
A second ago, I wanted nothing more than to cut you to pieces,
I trust you.
B, kiss C!
No, that's an abuse of authority!
If it were that easy, we wouldn't be in this situation to begin with!
The Queen of Virie was one of them.
To regain Haruna's stolen powers,
the Underworld denizen she mentioned
is in our world right now?
Eu She was known as the S-class Megalo.
The S-class Megalo was said to be unstoppable, regardless of how many fought her!
euShe, Naegleria, was in fact one of my friends.
i1she fought off countless Magiclad Girls all by herself.
She possessed great strength. The end.
Eu It's common knowledge.
Is it okay for you guys to live together?
Don't sweat the small stuff, okay?
At school, I'm Hoshikawa Kirara.
Of course you'll be attending.
What's that?
Thanks a ton!
Sorry 'bout that!
Th-They're touching me!
Yeah.
Have you kept it safe?
I'll be there.
Huh?
Why do you think we came here?
Don't tell lies, you stupid dumbface!
Oh!
Eu Nope.
Eu You're exactly the same as back then, too.
I guess I have no choice.
i1If we can get the hang of it, we should be done by morning.
Why the "Devil" part?!
I'm awake, I'm awake!
That was a close one! Almost drifted right off...
Aikawa, you okay for time?
i1I may not be able to beat Chris,
i1Because of that promise, I ended up messing with Saras' feelings.
Chris, you shouldn't let your guard down, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Plat plat!
Thank you!
But...
Yes.
From how far back?
Then, mix for about thirty minutes,
Ms. Haruna!
It leaves only their socks and panties.
Taeko, wake up!
My eyes!Ariel rules
And you were doing so well, too....
So what are all these weird people doing in my house?
Ayumoron is Ayumoron!
She doesn't seem at all concerned about this.
I guess my main body is causing you trouble.
It resembles you greatly.
He does represent lust, after all.
Luciferif there's a faggot 2 lines back, you might as well go with Lucifur.
Um... Was I really like this?
Let's enjoy ourselves for a bit.
Gnimrahc dna Ylevol!
They sucked!
Ayumoron! Are you here?!
What a pain.
So he's got no motivation at all?
Do you understand how much worry you've caused me?
Whatever.
Why don't we go to the nurse's office?
Aikawa's not feeling too well today, so try not to bother him.
Ouch! That really hurts!
I don't like the way he is today.
You're angry?
Who am I?
Eu.
i1Since you can't just ignore it all.
Well, it's good that everything's back to normal,
As long as you remember us, we'll be with you forever.
Off to another hard day at school?
i1Crap, this is bad!
I-I just...
You can do things we mere mortals could never dream of like it were nothing.
What's up with your manga obsession anyway?
If you read them over the break, even a monkey like you could ace the test.
I know I said I would do anything, but I can't possibly read all this!
It's okay, I understand.
It's not a gift.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
Mommy! Look at this!
She can't do what you're asking right now.
Sorry, did I scare you?
They're just like you! I can't stand you.
No, you've been working too hard.
You have a show next week, right?
The doctors say you need peace and quiet for a while, so you have to rest.
You don't have to worry about me.
You're working hard at something you love. That alone makes me happy.
O-Oh! I'm sorry!
W-Well...
I'm so sick of this!
This popsicle's pretty good!
The way these popsicles melt in your mouth is amazing,
So, Haruna!
Have you ever heard the saying "When the wind blows, the bucket makers prosper"?
so why don't you go help Haruna out?
That's not for sale.
Thank you.
Aikawa!
You touch it, you buy it!
Can I have that one, then?
Hey, Aikawa!
Not to brag or anything, but I think today's are my best yet.
To celebrate the launch of Kirara's new album,
Listen to it until your eardrums burst.
Way to go, Kirara!
It's cheap, dirt cheap!
Bring out your best item!
You must also
Rotten meat.
Haruna, what is this?
It's gone. Where is it?!
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't drank my super invisibility potion
You'll probably be just fine if you wait it out.
What do you mean, "probably"?!
Isn't that Philosopher's Stone you misplaced more important right now?
If it's not put away in a special container,
All right!
That's amazing!
Well, I felt kinda... weird just now.
I-I was looking for something.
I thought you were Orito, but I guess I was mistaken.
i1What?i0
Th-Thank you.
Even a monkey can fall from the tree. Even a master of calligraphy can flip his brush
A kid?
A drunk?!
I wasn't looking for ethanol, okay?! C2H5OH Also called ethyl alcoholwhat she said
You should at least know that much.
Was it really a hallucination?
Maybe my powers are starting to return as well?
Eu?
Kiss me. Give me a kiss.
I made lunch for you today.
Geez, Kanami-chan...
Can you stop with those dangerous looking toppings?
That said, your fried egg lunch tastes at least a thousand times better.
I don't care about anything else.
I'm pioneering the field of eggnology!
I don't want to go back in the middle of broad daylight.
Somehow, you really are cool, Aikawa.
Finally, I can go home.
Hey!
H-Hot...
Tee hee 3... I shouldn't give under-age kids drinks like this!
If you worry about that, then go and drink some water instead!
Somehow, I feel like I can talk to you about everything.
C-Can I come and visit again?
Carefree friend?
I just sensed the enemy's presence.
You know the graveyard behind our school?
The mysteriousness is one thing, but the cross-dressing takes it to a whole new level!
Cross-dressing, chainsaws and graveyards!
Right, Aikawa-kun?
There's no way a pervert like that exists, right?
I didn't wish for this to happen!
It must have been hard for you.
Yup.
You're not Fairy-san!

He's mumbling something.
Be quick about it, sensei!

I will never say things like "tee hee" or "kyaa".
I don't know.
You're totally famous now!
Orito!
Orito?
You're here today!

If I could, I would have had some already.

The sad thing is, the distance between you and me is extremely large right now.
You trashy darling!
This is imaginary Eu A!
It's common sense in Virie!
Isn't it okay to be that popular?
Seriously?!
Stop putting my personal information on the Internet! added the "on the Internet" for context purpose"
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.
In any case, don't think you can talk down to me like that forever.
Indeed. It hasn't even passed one-third of its processing.

The answer is Chris, the Masou-Shoujo!
Give me back my ring, dammit!
Please stop!

Gunmicha,
There's no turning back now.
No, there's just one less thing for me to worry about.
Let's all play together!
Are you joking around?
Is that true?!
There's someone in your world who was able to stand up against her, too.
Actually, if you're that surprised, you should at least get up.
Right?
then the Underworld's strongest would be her.
She's the one who made these gauntlets for me;
Oh, I'll pay you for the ticket.
If you drink it like this, it'll be an indirect kiss...

That's impossible!
Hello?
This is the girl who floats like a butterfly and thinks like a bee! What is it?

Whatever.
Oh?
Oh, since you saw my panties, I'll have to kill you later, okay?
...is that creep?
Isn't that Aikawa?
Did you come up with something new?
Ouch! That really hurts!
Really?
So what?
What are you, a pervert?
Ah, this human called Aikawa Ayumu looks rather interesting.
Even though you look cool saying that line, you actually look as sad as we are!
i1Hey everyone, it's been a while.
This ice cream is delicious!
If what you said is true,
She'd go as far as to use her trump card to win.
Even though you're unneeded, don't just stand there, please.
Don't speak with a voice that sounds like nails on a blackboard.
Well, that's to be expected.
There's nothing worthwhile here.
What are you thinking?
Oh, how cute.
How much are these?
Aikawa-kun!
Whoa, did you make these?
What's that?
Here you go!
I learned their recipe from my master.
Today, all customers who try the Ninja Ramen will also get 10 off on all items from the Kira Kira Shop.
Listen to it until your eardrums crack.
if you ever cut in line again,
Why isn't my stuff selling?!
Can you show it to me?
She's done for.
Jeez, it's so troublesome being the popular Haruna-chan.
It's gone, I tell you it's gone!
Hey, aren't you going a little overboard?being a little bit too cruel?!
Why would you even take it to the flea market?!
There's a time limit,
You remember when the shameless slime appeared, don't you?
What do you mean by that?!
Well, there were a lot of our schoolmates there.
I'm supposed to sneak into the forbidden garden wearing absolutely nothing?!
I've gained a ton!
What happened?
Focus, focus!
14.5 cm.
Next up is a face-down upper body stretch.
Can't see....
Try harder!
Whoa! A new record, Tae-chan!
Saras?
I appreciate it, Saras.
This is bad.
You ultra-miraculous rotten bug!
I'm a zombie, a Masou-Shoujo, an invisible man, and now I have X-ray vision.
Necromancer, is this interesting?
How indecent...
Coming to the pool was a great idea.
You're too soft, Aikawa.
They give low-fat milk!
N-Necromancer.
What's wrong with Bayumu?
Excuse me.
They say "once an insect, always an insect"...
You'll always be a despicable, damned insect, won't you?
Don't say thing like that.
Then, what do you think of Haruna?
No, it couldn't be. That Haruna...
Oh, crap!or Oh no!
That Haruna... Where did she go to?
I mustn't look!!
He was caught red-handed peeping at swimsuits.
Hurry up and help me out.
...I wanted to have more fun with Necromancer.
I see.
Yes. But it wouldn't be much of a fight.
C-Can I come too?
What should I get her as a present?
Hey! Don't make me answer on reflex!
Shut up, pervert!
What do you want to get, Eu?
C'mon, let's go in.
Haruna! This isn't a funny joke!
Yeah, yeah. It's this one, right?
All right, I guess that works.
Isn't this great, Eu?
Seriously?
Now then, let's eat the cake.
Even so, people should be happy on their birthdays.
Today will be cloudy,
If you go out, please take an umbrella with you.
Here.
I owe you one, Aikawa Ayumu-sama!
H-Huh?
Eu, I'm home.
No problem.
Am I troubling you?
I'm thankful for that.
I wouldn't be able to search for the culprit who killed me.
Necromancer of the underworld, Eucliwood Hellscythe.
Did you see the news just now?!
A serial killer...
Huh?
That's not a kick!
Gross!
At least understand that much.
I don't believe anyone who refers to herself as a genius.
Right now!
Lower half? You pervert!
You're the pervert!
I didn't know I had such hidden powers.
I super ultra extremely don't want to,Better if it is "super ultra extremely" -sm
If someone discovered that I, a mere first year student,
I hope they're not fighting.
What're you doing?
I wasn't talking to you!I'm not talking to you!
No human can have this much power!
I'm not a pervert!
Ah, damn it!
That's not a kick!
appointed as a Masou-Shoujo!
...ruined!Please double check the ellipsis here. -sm
I'm ruined!
Oh, and I'm also a Masou-Shoujo.
I'm home!
Got it.
Meat too.
It's because Onii-chan got home so late,
Double, double, more!
So who is this?
My hobby is the Swallow Reversal Technique.
You entered my house without permission, and now you're insulting me?
You really do as you please, don't you?
Do you really intend to kill me?
After all, I'm a ninja.
She's strong!
As expected from a servant of Hellscythe-dono.As one'd expect from one who is Hellscythe-dono's servant.Better if "As one'd expect" is changed to "As expected". -sm
Oh, I get it!
I want to know too.
My servant?
For example, you must wear a maid uniform and be nice every morning.
I'm pretty sure I'm more of an expert with young women than some stupid man.
JyaWell then, if you're here by yourself this late, people will hit on you.
No, the police?
Help me, no!
So, I'm a necromancer's servant,
I don't think anything would happen over one or two days.
You must be having a hard time, too.Please change "You've" to "You" -sm
I don't need any sympathy from a zombie, you damn insect.
Isn't that right?
Shut up! Don't pet my head, stupid Ayumu!
That's not a kick!
I can't eat it...
What good weather, don't you think?
It feels like today is going to be another bad day.
How misleading.
It's Ayumu's fault for not buying enough in the first place.
there's good weather today.
I wonder if he made it to school safely.
Are you all right, Aikawa-kun?
You're gross.
That's enough. Let's go bowling together.
There's not a single block that can be removed now.
So this means I win, right?
Does Hellscythe-dono have any idea?
Oh, God. I don't care what happens to me...
Orito's fragile heart wouldn't be able to take it.
I said it's your turn to throw.
N-No.
Ayumu.
Say it! Spit it out!
i1Explain!i0
For you to be hiding things from me...
Aikawa!
It must be a girl.
Yes.
Why do you get all the girls?
Hm?
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.
Really?
To me, it's as if you're my own little sister.
Um, sorry for bringing this up,
About the culprit who killed my dad and mum!
Do you have a fever?
No, it's actually because of your...
Just expressionless like that... I'm scared.
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal.
As if I'll let you have it!
It's moving! This radish is moving!
What else is there? Would you like to chew on a shoe instead?
She's more worried about the bowl than me.
I saw a beautiful garden of flowers, Mum.
As I was saying, this dishfscx300-
Who is she talking to?
He is Haruna's school teacher in Virie.
Take care!
What is this "artefact"?
So you were the one responsible.
Hellscythe-sama, you mustn't push yourself.
Pardon me for causing a ruckus.
I'll take their souls back to the underworld with me.
Basically, she would feel the same pain as you when you are wounded.
That's Hellscythe-sama.
The souls are no longer here.
You can't?
Yes. Even if I die, the magic powers will still activate.
You must hate me now, don't you?
Because if my emotions were triggered, your fate would be the one most affected, right?
Hurry up and defeat Shironaga already.
For my sake! And only my sake!
Regarding that, I apologise. And I get it without you saying it twice!
I understand.
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal!
750... 800...!
I'm not telling you.
Shut up!
No problem.
Oh, you're not Haruna, are you?
Haruna?
Ah, well then, please tell her to not worry about Kyotofu anymore.
Yes, it's an errand I asked Haruna to do.
She can't seem to find it, so it's fine.
Could that be the artefact Haruna was looking for?
And they don't accept cash on delivery either.
But if she's not interested, she won't try at all.
Haruna!
All I can do is hide and take cover.
It's not like I was going with you or anything!
I don't have anything like that.
Something you want?
How many times do I have to kill you before you die?
You know, don't you?
I just happened to manipulate their memories a bit, like Orito-san's.
I wonder why. A normal human would have died instantly.
Making me run around like this is such a pain.
Ayumu's enemy? Then she's my enemy too.
Where did you learn how to dispel a magical barrier, you failure?
As long as I understand the theory of setting up a magical barrier, I can figure out how to dispel it.
Don't worry. She's a monster pretending to be human.
Do I really have to?
Guess I don't have a choice.
I didn't know you had such interests, you pervert!
Why, thank you.
Hello, thank you for taking care of our Haruna.
So you're finally here.
Eu.
Magic powers are to be consumed by even greater magic powers.
It's almost as if you're telling me to take away your magic powers!
Hey, did you know?
500!
I've never felt like this before.
I've fully regenerated now.
I have no choice but to take your lives now.
What it means to take a life...
Being alone was peaceful,
but I could never know what happiness was.
Then resurrect and show me!
How dare you...
You will have to atone for it.
H-Hot! I'm going to die! Die!
Who are you?
I see, so you were the one who made my student...
I wonder.
This feeling... You're a Megalo?
However, it's not like the seeds of insecurity have disappeared.
Huh? All the ingredients I used were from this world!
Are there other zombies besides me?
I'm here for you.
It's done, Ayumu!
I was the one who did most of the work.
I'd like to do a duet with Hiramashi too.
If it's with Aikawa-kun, I wouldn't mind.
Eh?
I think I'll pass, after all.
Would you like to try doing a duet, too?
As you can see, I don't want to go to school during summer for the make-up work.
Yes, just like a spinning top.
Where are the process equations for that?
Shut up! I said I'll write them for you!
...here as well.
S-Sorry...
This is bad.
Actually, I have a favour I need to ask of you. Actually, I have a favour I need to ask from Ayumu-san.
It's fragile, so please handle it with care, all right?
Damn it!
Damn you.
Damn it!
Well, it seems like you're fine.
Mama will get mad at me!
Hey! Hurry up and transform!
Your opponent is a AA-class Megalo, the horrible Wanderlei Horse!
Don't come near me so nonchalantly, please.
Yeah, something like that.
Puni?
I'll give you this.
Just shut up and eat it.
Se-ra?
and analysed the soup's flavour.
I'll explain everything from the beginning.
This is enough.
Yes.
Eh? Yeah.
I see. That's why you never sucked my blood.
I was just kidding. Sorry.
When the river in the sky flows, following two beasts, the legendary man appears.
What did everyone write?
I wish the Earth would turn into a boiled egg. By Haruna.
If other people see it, it won't work!
I'll let you know when I'm done, so keep writing until then, Ayumu.
It's a given for a wife to make a bento for her husband, right?
To be honest, it's always been my dream to become a bride.
Don't call me that!
Orito! You know her?
There has to be a limit to being a damn insect.
Pitiful.
If dark seaweed looks like fried eggs to you, that's probably it.
Though, Aikawa's bento kinda made me laugh.
I guess I'll have my mother make some for me, too.
"Fall" in love, not "fell" in love? Future tense?
Why are you naked?
No, I'll do it! The bigger the hurdle, the more fired up I am!
You're in the track and field club, after all.
You see, all men fall for gap moe.
Show him a Yuki that's different from your usual self and capture his heart.
Indeed. Kyun.
No, don't be sorry.
Yuki sure is trying her best.
The first bite is for Aikawa!
This is the finishing touch.
Y-Yeah.
You and Sera are enemies, right?
Both you and Sera have it hard.
My, how cute!
Why did you have to say that out loud?!
Shut up! It's even more embarrassing for me!
Eh? Sure.
Though, my face has turned red!
My eyeballs have finally regenerated.
To be honest, aren't you a little happy that I call myself your bride?
Today was certainly interesting.
Shouldn't you know without having to ask?
You don't understand the importance of having a mission.
You cannot defy a law. That's why I'm your bride!
Which is it?!
It's more important that we search for the Necromancer, don't you agree?
It disgusts me.
But thanks to you, I've broken free.
Is that right?
We'll definitely find Eu.
Huh?
Ah... It was always that way, wasn't it?
Is that a Megalo?
Isn't that the Necromancer's doll?
No matter how you look at this, it's wrong!
Haruna!
Second echelon confirmed.
Break forth, Masticore.
Huh? Looks like something's missing.
Yes, the breath of the gods shall beckon a blizzard.
Our friend we just spent the entire day having fun with.
I get it, I get it.
Otherwise...
Run away! I told you to run, didn't I?!
Later, then!
You're covered in dirt. I'll have the bath ready for you.
Farewell...
That's why... I must bid you farewell.
Don't tell me what I already know, Haruna.
Is that some kind of French convention?
We searched for her everywhere we could, but...
Get off me! I can't see anything like this!
Save me!
But I don't understand how to lie.
It looks so delicious. My cheeks are going to melt off!
Don't tell me... Has Eucliwood returned to the underworld?
I'll take care of him.
Don't talk to me!
That guy is still out there somewhere.
You figured out where he lives?Does he know where she is?
Yeah. I'll e-mail you a map.
Haruna!
Yikes! I shared some of my Tom Yum soup with someone around there.
Eu...
I'd like you to return Eu to us.
I don't know anything about that.
Let Eu go!
If I let her go, I don't know where she'll disappear to.
What is it?
Eu!
No! No!
Hey, we don't have time to be playing around!
What, what, what?
We're running out of time.
Eu...
Hey!
This is a job for his wife!
The Necromancer has become disillusioned because you're weak.
You're wrong... I...
It's so quiet. There's no one here.
Haruna...
Haruna-san could use it too.
All of this is your fault, Eucliwood.
Isn't it painful? Isn't it sad?
either the blood of Eucliwood Hellsythe has to be offered upon it, to offer upon it the blood of Eucliwood Hellscythe...
In other words, it's up to you, Seraphim.
Nomobuyo, Oshi, Hashitawa, Dokeda, Gunmicha, De, Ribura!
Yeah, because I'm a genius Masou-Shoujo.
Saraswati... Everyone!
Then I'll use 500!
Do you know what kinds of memories she lives with every single day?!
There's no way that will happen.
I have Haruna, and also Sera.
That's right, I'm selfish!
Right!
That's disgusting.
Love really does pull two people together.
What the hell? It seems like everyone won that lottery.
That just made it twice as creepy.
Idiot-Ayumu! Hit it back to me properly!
You fool...
Ah! Sera-san!
Not that I want it confirmed... but... could that be...
Whoa! She's cute!
Huh? This is a mission, then?
Or is this very moment her dbut? An introduction event?
The arrival of an amazing newcomer!
No...
I will stop you.
For you to have followed me this far... I'm impressed.
It's stuck!
Producer!
That's wrong!
You idiot!
It doesn't matter.
Amazing! She is a diamond, after all!
Hoo hoo hoo
Eu singingblur5 and mine as well.
The Necromancer's singing.
Haruna and Eu singingblur5 You've shown me your crying and smiling face.
How did it come to this?
But it's great.
It would be great if all the women in the world could wear such wonderful outfits.
What shameless clothing!
But that's all right, isn't it?
So with that said, we made a new one!
I'm going to do my best to win!
all the men struggled to be faster than everyone else,
Then, here.
I see.
"These goldfish seem to be enjoying themselves."
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal.
Don't you want to nyan-nyan?
I actually...
I hereby declare that I will win against those overwhelming odds!
His summer break came to an end after the festival.
I guess this is necessary, given the circumstances...
Hey, Aikawa.
No... yes.
I cannot let those words slide!
Hmm, why are we in leotards?
Aesthetics
It definitely looks like they wouldn't let us in if we asked them to.
We're here lol
You with the bare ass!
We're missing eye drops as an ingredient.
Can we really make meat stew like this?
As far as I know,
It's horrible!
Mithril sword.
And I hereby declare that the substitute card game tournament will now begin!
All right... Allow us to begin!
It's not stockings, it's panty-stockings!I prefer Kneesocks, but that's just me....--Paw
It's no big deal for me to let you see this.I pulled this edit out of my ass.--Paw
You only managed to get the one card at the start?
Are you mad?
I've always admired you, Aikawa-kun.
Make dinner.
Hey, you!
Really?
So, what did you do today?
When I woke up from a nap, it was already evening.
Necromancer of the underworld, Eucliwood Hellscythe.
There's been another murder case in the neighbourhood.
More so than at home...
A bit hard to believe, but...
Huh? What're you talking about?
'Cause I'm a zombie...
Why are you a magical...
Get me a futon as well.
So, who's this person?
Oh, I see.
Then, this is the same as a phone.
Refrain Year Rising Class,
and my lower half has already been reattached,
Who is this guy?
Ohhh, I want you.This line, tilde or comma. -sm
I want you.
A crayfish?
Nomobuyo, Oshi, Hashitawa,
Don't say such a stupid thing!
No human can have this much power!

This won't work. Even if he's invincible,
It's coming...!
What's this? You're only a pervert...
That's wicked... Aikawa...
...are appointed as a Masou-Shoujo!
It's a pervert!
Aikawa...
and erase the memories of those who saw me.
Seems like anything can be done, being a Masou Shoujo.It's convenient, being a Masou Shoujo.
There hasn't been any Megalo attacks,
I just don't want to think about these troublesome things.
Where's the rice?!
Everyone! Aikawa's bento is amazing!
I don't understand you at all.
I want to eat something besides fried eggs.
What kind of game is that?
Meat too.
I'm so sorry! Eat up!
Haruna seems to be quite harmless.
You're not a friend of Haruna's?
My hobby is the Swallow Reversal Technique.
We probably don't need to do that, Eu.
Call me Onii-chan, please.
Let's go somewhere without people.
My hobby...
The Swallow Reversal Technique...
You lost the fight, right?!
What a frightening woman!doesnt sound right... ishi?
Really?
I was stupid to think I could talk to a girl I didn't know!
I spoke to a girl I didn't even know. Awesome!
No, the police?
Help me, no!
What the hell happened...
So, I'm a necromancer's servant,
It's to prepare for a long battle.
What do you mean?
I don't need any sympathy from a zombie, you damn insect.
After all, I'm a ninja.
Mystletainn Kick!
What good weather.
I couldn't eat it in my dream.
I'll win and give half to Hellscythe-dono.
He had an umbrella, so he's probably fine.
That's what you call an idiot.
He won't die.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Bowling?
It's a shame to let these tickets I won go to waste, so-
I don't understand. Can a mere zombie do something like that?
Does Hellscythe-dono have any idea?
Approved fnArial

I am...
Ayumu. Eu's sign
I'm sorry.
I envy you so much!
But, in a way, I'm still jealous.
You...
I can't see anything through my tears.
No, this is...
...a victim of that serial killing spree.
Seriously, Aikawa has a thing for twintails, you know.
Oh, it's done.
Most of them have healed already.
Ah... Please do.
Um, sorry for bringing this up,
I'm a bit excited.
Please tell me about that person!
He said because I saw the culprit, he might come after me agian.
Just expressionless like that... I'm scared.
It can't be. Could the culprit be...
Meat, meat!
Eh?
What the hell are they making in there?
This is the first time I've tried this thing called "cooking."
It's quite interesting, isn't it?
I haven't found the artifact yet.
Take care!
No, that's not it. I think it's called terror.
Of course! It's square shaped... and soft...
That was fast.
Pleased to meet you.
I am there to let things enter, but stop them from leaving.
Therefore...
Excuse me?
Pardon me for causing a ruckus.
Eh?
I wonder; I don't know the details.
Watch out!
When affected by strong magic powers, the wavering becomes larger and fiercer.
EuIt was interesting.
EuWhen my words transform into power, I feel extreme pain in my head. I don't want that to happen anymore.
EuMy powers have nothing to do with my will.
Why would I?
There is only a kind girl sitting here!
Please don't cause unwanted damage with your reckless actions,
Regarding that, I apologize. You don't need to say it twice, I get it!
Damn it!
Leave it to the genius Masou-Shoujo, Haruna-chan!
Make an incision on Shironaga's neck.
So you were quietly watching us, huh?
She's just lonely. She's been hospitalized for a year already.
Thank you very much! Come again!
Haruna! Dinner's ready, so come downstairs-
EuNo problem.
Do you need to talk to Haruna?
If there's something you need to tell her, I can pass on the message later.
Yes, it's an errand I asked Haruna to do.
I just love Kyoto's tofu.
Yes, I thought she was going to buy Kyotofu from Kyoto, but there's no Kyotofu from Kyoto in Tokyo.
Ah, but recently, something unexpected happened.
Hey!
All I can do is hide and take cover.
I'm amazed that Kyouko-chan had no problems coming to a place like this.
Here, the Kyotofu you requested.
Were you scared?
They were all lies.
Making me run around like this is such a pain.
I sense a different power inside her.
Even with this, it doesn't seem perfectly fair.  hando ga tarinai gurai da ze, wtf is with the lines in this show 
Yep, you're a pervert!
Don't tell me...
And that's... Eu, it was you?
Originally, you weren't supposed to be fooling around in a place like this, right?
No, she's just afraid of death.
EuGo home.Original is "Go back to where you came from" changed it to a more literal traslation due to the meaning been a bit off with that - Nana
Who would...?
That's the power of her words.
Because of her powerful ability to kill...
sign Die
Haruna!
What the hell is she...?
It sure was difficult fighting with my eardrums pierced.
How sickening!
I have no choice, but to take your lives now.
What it means to take a life...
Well, I can't die, can I?
I was an idiot.
My life changed because you killed me.
You've taken the lives of too many.
No...
Let's stop, shall we?
Ah?
All right, I'll use it to make mapo tofu.
Oh my, it seems like you're awake.
This sure was entertaining.
The King of the Night.
Umm, Dai-sensei.
Eu.
I suppose...
Eu I didn't think there would be any.
Eu so I erased him.was erased.
I think I'll pass, after all.
Good evening, Aikawa Ayumu here.
If your grades are bad, I heard you'll lose your summer break doing make-up work.
That's why the spiral galaxy spins round and round like this... yes, just like a spinning top.
She isn't called a "Genius Masou-Shoujo" for nothing.
Thank you.
Ayumu!
What were you doing, going off on your own like that?
All right! The sunlight feels great!
What is it? Cute!
Sera, is she someone you know?
She's a Vampire-Ninja, but she belongs to the enemy faction.
Allow me to join in too!
You conceited perverted damn insect!
From now on, make sure to brush your teeth before you check to see if someone's a boy or girl.
You don't like barbecue pork?
Just shut up and eat it.
Thank you.
Man, this really is delicious.
Isn't it amazing?
I do not.
What's not?
I see. That's why you never sucked my blood.
Anywayfscx300-
Yes, I'd make a vow to love you.
pink signI wish the Earth would turn into a boiled egg. By Haruna.
All right! Now that I'm done writing my wishes, I'll go set up for the ritual in Ayumu's room.
Jeez, you're all writing such crazy things. I guess it can't be helped.
The preparations are done!
Hmm, Dai-sensei's?
I've already heard about it from Sera already.
Tomonori-
Ah, but there is one thing we can agree on.
Orito is...
Shall I make you into a friend of a friend?
You disgust me.
Have I kept you waiting, Haruna?
Y-You idiot!
What are...you saying
Ayumu...
Ero-Ayumu!
Eu Miracle.
Do I have to take responsibility for other people's dreams?
Eu Pitiful.
Eu The other person is.
Haruna sure did it this time.
Let me have a bite, too!
It was all dark seaweed.
I plan on trying hard to fall in love with him, but I've never loved a guy.
Never, never, never, never, never!
But the food Aikawa gets at home is pretty damn good.
You're in the track and field club, after all.
Stop talking like a guy. Note: Yuki is using "Ore" to refer to herself, which is usually used by men.
Show him a Yuki that's different from your usual self and capture his heart.
H-Here, dig in.
A secret message, huh?
Are you okay with going home this way?
Kids nowadays are so daring.retime please - Nanakoto
Yuki-chan?
Just call me Tomonori.
I see.
Speaking of which, what happened to that tonkotsu machine?
I've been telling you that's not enough!
I'm the one who is embarrassed, idiot!
It's rare for you to be wearing clothes like that.
Well, sorry about that. The leaf girl chose these clothes for me.
Eh? Sure.
All right, it's a date!
A-Aikawa?
Don't say stuff like that outside school!
Besides, marrying a girl just because you kissed is childish.
Whilst I was out walking, I happened to see you.
I'll leave it at this for today.
Today was certainly interesting.
What do you mean?
Why do you have to kill Eu?
That's ridiculous!
Do you have no choice as a Vampire-Ninja but to go after Eu?
Do you really intend to kill Eu?
Will you kill her? Or won't you?!
I'm abandoning this mission.
Ah... Right at the good part.
It looks like everyone is frantically searching for you.
Why did that fall over here all of a sudden?
But your face is messed up.
I don't think so.
This is bad! Run!
Oh? You know about me?
Yes. The rumours about you are well known in the underworld.
How's this?!
Get up! Maelstrom!
Tomonori? What's wrong?
Final echelon confirmed.
Is that the guy from before?
Eh? Why?
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal
Releasing limiters ?.
Sera, stay back.
Our friend we just spent the entire day having fun with.
Ai... kawa. Help me...
10...
8...
You think I'll...
Whew...
W-Wait a second... I wasn't finished with you, yet.
Oh... My home is this way.
...Later, then!
Really? Don't stay out too late, then.
Not every wish can come true.
Why did I write something like that?
What are you moping around for, idiot Ayumu?
I see...
There's a different me, screaming:
You'll have some too, right?
Sera!
I've returned...
What happened, Sera?
I was a fool...
Home delivery service!
Ah... like Romanee-Conti...?
No way.
You! Don't tell me...
I see... You're also a zombie.
Don't tell me... Has Eucliwood returned to the underworld?
Ayumu! Are you all right?
Masou-Shoujo, you're so much fun.
Would you like to die so you can see her again?
Load it on. Load it all on!
Sure. Thank you!
But that'll take time, so...
Yeah. I'll e-mail you a map.
Really?
Is that right?
We made quite a bit.
What do you think of having a body that cannot die?
I don't know anything about that.
This... This...
Eu...
Damn... after them!
You did it, Haruna!
We're running out of time.
Hey Ayumu, you...
It sure is nice being the main character.
But you blew up, didn't you?
Wait right there...
...traditional medicine from my village.
Ah, I made a mistake.
It's because you're weak, Ayumu, that the Necromancer has become disillusioned.
This is our farewell.
I... I...
Haruna...
Ayumu...
Ah, leaf lady, look! Ayumu is back to life!
Ayumu, a megalo is-
Because you won't kill me...
How good of you to come.
A Megalo has been called forth... by Eucliwood, of course.
There are too many of them...
That's what Mystletainn is saying!
"Because I want to send him flying too!"I want to beat the crap out of him, too.
Yeah, because Haruna-chan is a genius Masou-Shoujo.
Leave it to Haruna-chan.
Double Mystletainn Kick!
Yeah!
Impossible!
You've known her so much longer than I have, yet why can't you understand her?
800!
Going further would be just too painful.
If it's about your fate or whatever, I'll do something about it, somehow!
I finally have you back.
Eu You're being selfish, just like Haruna.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Welcome back, Eu.
Right!
Right?
That's disgusting.
Ayumu, don't talk about strange delusions.
It took me 999 tries to actually win.
You're the one worrying about it...
So... you had a swimsuit lying around.
I'm being watched...
Amazing!
That just made it twice as creepy.
Are you ready? Filthy commoners,
I'm going to send you flying from my first note.
Kira!! Strike me down!
Oh, Aikawa!
Where's your libido?
I don't really get it, but the fact that you get obsessed with stupid crap is definitely clear.joined, fits into one line -masat
...will always be left behind by the times.
She's really serious...
Uh, I haven't said quite that much.
Hey, Haruna... Huh?
Haruna-chan's ranking is steadily rising!
Sweat more!
Is Haruna-chan's popularity too much for the computer to handle?!
Let's go! Sing along!
I told you that you can't speak while you have Hellscythe-san's magic in you.
Eu singing Because it causes pain...
Does that mean...?!
Haruna and Eu singing my prayers for your happiness are in the evening sky,
Haruna and Eu singing and mine as well.
In this moment of happiness, we can just watch and enjoy...
But it's great.
Is it okay for you to say that?
Disgusting!
You...
Champion-level damn insect!
Yeah! Let's sing again!
Eu Welcome back.
...dokeda gunmicha de ribura!
This unchanging scenery...
But to be honest, that's a lie.
Most people go about their days without realising it,
...a Manchu Han imperial feast.
Look, there's some rice onfscx300-
Just who the heck is she?
Did you see the news just now?!
A serial killer...
Do you really get it?
However, I feel at ease when I come here.
Hurry up and die!
That's a pretty big assumption!
Don't talk!
Just give up!
Have some respect for the dead.
Virie's genius Masou-Shoujo,
My grades depended on it.
In the blink of an eye!
Um...
What do you expect me to do?
Necromancer of the underworld, Eucliwood Hellscythe-san.
She came from the magical world?
the little things don't surprise me anymore.
You live alone.
No!You can't!
Who is this guy?
I'm not!No way!
Yeah, you are!
Are you actually scared?
D-Don't say such a stupid thing!
Don't look down on me!
No human can have this much power!
But, I...
he'll lose his arms and legs.
Since you stole my magic powers, Please double check this line and the next one. -sm
you can become a Masou-Shoujo yourself!
Damn...
Here I go. I'll get used to it!
All right, follow my lead. All right? Follow me!
It's coming...
Only the clothes?!
I'm not a pervert!
What was my special technique again?
Stop it!
Don't take it!
Thank goodness.
Aikawa...
and I'm slowly getting used to these new aspects of my life.
Shut up! It's fried eggs every day for the likes of you!
I'll make dinner soon.
It's ready!
Ayumu, give me a lot more!
Well, whatever the reason,
Ms. Miso soup? Well, can be Miso soup-san too. Please double check this. -sm
Thanks for the meal.
We seem to be about the same age.
You're not a friend of Haruna's?
Then...
Hey, you.
A foreigner?!
Vampire?
Manservant.
Sera-san, was it?
I'll cut you up until you are incapable of fighting.
Eu told me to send you away.
What?!
250 percent!250
I'm...
...a zombie.
What is she talking about?
Excuse me.
My eyes were captivated by a silver-haired girl in armour.My eyes caught a silver-haired girl in armour.
My once-in-a-lifetime pickup line failed!
I'll break dance!
I didn't think talking to a cute girl could be this much fun.
JyaWell then, if you're here by yourself this late, people will hit on you.
Should I call an ambulance?
But...
Even if I find the murderer, what would I do?
Just who are you?
What is with this frightening woman?
What? It's raining today?
Sure. If you're serious, I'll gouge them right out of your head.
I couldn't eat it in my dream.
If you want it that badly, why not just go buy some more?
I was shocked.
There were two tickets. Could this be fate?
That's right. I'm inviting you since we're such good friends.
What the hell?! Next, next!
Everything I hear makes him sound like a strange little pervert.
Hey, take a look over there.
It's your turn first. Go throw it already.
A-Aikawa...
You replied without a second thought?!
To be honest, it happened so suddenly, and with all the commotion...
i1Explain!i0
It's fine. It's fine already.
Orito.
I'm jealous!
If I win, I shall live in your house from today on!
Yay!
A formidable opponent.
Um, sorry for bringing this up,
but did you see the face of your attacker?
What kind of a person was it?
What is going on?
The person I know is this expressionless, speechless person.
I think it's that person.
That person, the culprit,
It can't be. Could the culprit be...
Senpai, you're gross. Almost as gross as Orito-senpai.
Gimme a hand!
You take care of this pot.
...right?
Haruna?
Ayumu, lend me the cell phone.
Yes, yes! I'm coming!
Well, then...
Eu.
I've never seen them heal so fast.
I forgot.
What did you come here for?
I'll take their souls back to the underworld with me.
Eu...
Listen. When she heals someone, she takes the pain onto herself.
it means she recognises you as someone special.
They were probably sacrificed.
Sacrificed?
Do I have to answer?
So don't do it again.
When my words transform into power,
Yes. Even if I die, the magic powers will still activate.
Hate.
...Triple A Class Megalo,
Go, Ayumu!
It's very, very disgusting.
Now is your chance!
Don't look this way.
You're a damn despicable insect, aren't you?
She's just lonely. She's been hospitalised for a year already.
Thank you very much! Come again!
Yes, but as long as I can replenish my blood, I won't die so easily.
It's none of your business!
Just what are they doing?
Ah, are you Dai-sensei?
So basically, she was supposed to go to Kyoto to buy Kyotofu, but came to Tokyo by accident?
But for her to mistake Tokyo for Kyoto...
Eh?
Eh?
I wanted to hear your voice, too.
Leave the dishes in the kitchen. I'll wash them later.
Please don't leave Eu behind!
Thanks. Sorry for asking you out to a strange place like this.
That's just... Even your own family?
It seems my memory manipulation didn't work on you.
I went through all the trouble of collecting powerful souls and even had to kill a Megalo monster. How gross.
In that case...
Oh, I can move.
This town seems to have more bloodshed than the village I resided in.
No, she's no Vampire-Ninja.
You damn insect.
I wanted to have my revenge without this outfit at the very least, but...
Should I just pulverise your body like this? Or...
Let go. Let go, damn it. You pervert!
More like, she's too much trouble, so please take her back with you.
Shall I turn you into a Masou-Shoujo, too?
This time, you'll burn until even your bones catch fire!
And that's... Eu, it was you?
Originally, you weren't supposed to be fooling around in a place like this, right?
Obsessing over a single boring man...
Eu...
Why don't you just lose already?!
 Die
After we get home, will you help me think of a name for it?
At least dodge it!
I was an idiot.
My life changed because you killed me.
I'll kill you until you run out of stolen lives.
You will have to atone for it.
That's a relief.
Well, it's not like I don't understand your anger, but...
Let's stop, shall we?
The King of the Night.
Um, Dai-sensei.
Although I don't really understand, but...
Eh?
Thanks for the meal.
Root three minus root two.
Right?
Thank you! Onii-chan is overjoyed!
Ah, thanks.
Um, there's something I'd like you to hold on to for me.
What's the name of this thing?
Damn you.
Hey! Hurry up and transform!
Guess I have no choice.
Oh, yes!
Huh, who?
This is Maelstrom.
Sera, you're overdoing it.
Ayumu...
Se-ra?
Wait, we're here to find out how you defeated those Megalo, right?
For the restaurants rated three stars, we sneaked into the stores,
...and that's how it works.
Do you get it now?
Hey, but if you did that, the town would be filled with thick sticky soup.
I do not.
It's about Mael.
That's why you should have avoided it, no matter what.
What's that?
I told you that was just an accident. Anyway, what's that?
Then this deadly Santa Claus grants a wish only to the human wearing a ponytail.
I want to dive into a sea of soy sauce pickled vegetables. By Eu.
It's not Tomonori!
But Tomonori is Tomonori.
Honestly, what were you looking at through these glasses?
You disgust me.
Have I kept you waiting, Haruna?
Don't do perverted things in my dream!
Miracle.
That was an accident, remember?
The other person, that is.
Let me have a bite, too!
Hey, Kanami!
Just as I thought, it has to be that, right?
You're in the track and field club, after all.
Gap... moe?
Yuki has fallen for you, Ayumu-kun...
Indeed. Kyun.
Like I said...
Are you okay with going home this way?
Is it like a real ninja mansionfscx300-
Without an honorific?!
It's already decided that I'm your wife, so it can't be helped.
That's the rule.
Speaking of which, what happened to that tonkotsu machine?
Well then, I'm going this way.
I've been telling you that's not enough!
Ah, sure.
All right, it's a date!
We're going to that shop.
Refused that fast?!
My eyes! My eyes!
Argh, impossible! Definitely impossible!
All right. If you say so, I'll endure it.
You're still hung up on that?
This one, and then this one.
What an unfortunate coincidence,
I'm a genius, love-confessing, Masou-Shoujo!
Please be gentle.
That order is obviously wrong!
Do you have no choice as a Vampire-Ninja but to go after Eu?
Since when have you been so honest?
Is that right?
You're the only one who can grant my desire.
Huh?
But your face is messed up.
Ah... It was always that way, wasn't it?
This is bad! Run!
Surely you understand, Eucliwood.
By the way, what is it you want?
Haruna, hang in there!
Damn it! Move! Move! Move!
Move!
What the?!
We will now walk the path of life.
Budding star, lend me your power.
Mystletainn?
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal.
Oh, my. Looks like it's getting out of control.
It will eventually shut off on its own.
But as long as it's wreaking havoc, there's also a chance that it will self-destruct.
Well, when something like this happens...
That thing behind her is strange, right? It's freaky, right?
At this rate...
I can feel it coming in. Stay out of me!
10...
Whew...
Welcome back, Tomonori.
Smells burnt...
Aikawa, th-thank you for today.
But I cannot exist alongside you.
Because everything is my fault.
What the hell?
For instance, calling someone a "Flight Attendant"?
A few months have passed since Eu's disappearance.
There's a different me, screaming:
I haven't heard a thing, either.
I've returned...
While I was soaking in the bath,
This brings me back...
I don't think the beautiful sounds...
The flea shampoo you recommended worked wonders!
so please take care to interpret their feelings.
Don't tell me... Has Eucliwood returned to the underworld?
Ayumu!
I wonder...
Ayumu! Are you all right?
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal!
Leaf lady!
Masou-Shoujo, you're so much fun.
I'll put some on for you.
Don't talk to me!
I will.
Y-You don't need to thank me.
Haruna!
What're you doing when we're in such a hurry?
You do it like this.
Hellscythe-dono was in front of your house just now!
Is that right?
I thought you would come.
How about we eat together?
Sure.
Seconds, seconds, seconds!
I'd like you to return Eu to us.
I'm fine.
but don't you think eternity is cruel and boring?
I refuse.
Huh?
This... This...
Eu, come with me.
What do we do about the bomb?
This thing's a parasitic dimensional bomb!
Idiot, idiot, idiot!
Hi, I'm the main zombie.
Why won't he get up?
I was trying to save Haruna!
Just rot here forever, Aikawa.
Did you call me here from Virie because...
...you wanted to know the answer to that?
But Haruna-san's answer is still only worth 50 points.
There's no value in your existence. Why not disappear?
If you snuff out your existence, you can finally relax!
What are you doing, idiot-Ayumu?
Don't hit me!
If you've grown that timid, you don't have to come back.
I feel like I'm the one who should be worried.
All of this is your fault, Eucliwood.
Shut it! Read the mood!
Shortly, this city will be destroyed...
You hate me so much you want to kill me.
To all wandering souls... I give peace.
I don't want to kill my friends anymore.
Shut up! We're in the middle of something important.
These are the results of what will happen with your good intentions.
Interesting.
I didn't expect you to attack head on.Show me what you've got.
We're incredibly cute right now!
600!
Her smile?
But she's had no choice but to try hard and live with it.
That's why I'm pushing you!
If I had my wish, I would like to stay with Ayumu. - Eu.
Yes.
Welcome back, Haruna.
We're all going to play!
...is important for beginning idols.
What is this? A new Vampire-Ninja plot?
The internet and sexual culture are different things...
Huh?
I won't be convinced by your words alone.
I will stop you.
I'll have to do my best to catch up to her.
That would be your ego talking.
What an opening...
It's just starting.
I don't care. The show must go on!
With this terrible song?
Idols must change to suit a new age.
My live concert...
Ta-da!
Huh?
Eu singingblur5 Because it causes pain...
That's...
Haruna and Eu singingblur5 As long as I remember the words,
Mystletainn-sensei?
Stimulating.
This isn't right!
Aikawa Ayumu.
but the world is filled with secrets which one must not come into contact with.
Wonderball! Wonderball!
At that moment,
First is the speed eating.
Then it's the takoyaki!
How about you, Aikawa?
Are you two okay?
Because Haruna looked lonely when the festival wasn't lively.have to edit this, heated up as in excitedfun etc etc
That is the fearsome ero-power!start this later and end the previous line laterDone.--Paw
We are extremely perverted right now!extremely perverted
Actually, I promised to give a cooking lesson today, so...
That's great.
W-Wait!
Eh, Haruna said...
Weird-breast?
Aesthetics
It's a Vampire-Ninja base, after all, even if it's rotten.
Weird pose lol
Just keep moving.
That's not hidden at all.Again, I'm leaving the game-sounding term instead of making it "big-breasted."--Paw
In other words, miso.
Even if you look up her skirt, you can't see anything when she's wearing stockings!
You're playing dirty!
And now, let the finals begin!
"There's no way I'll let the demon king escape!"
"I'll handle him here!"
"Looks like he's here!"
I want to see them, but...
Nope.
Coming home from elementary school,
Umbrella.
be1I wonder if it's because I'm with you
be1Notice me, my Zombie Overlord

You're recording yourself?
Let's do this, Yukinori!
misleading you into thinking, "Whoa! Those are huge!"
Necromancer.
Onii-chan, it's so embarrassing. Please don't look at me like that.
It's said that sometimes men can act like bugs,  We need toshould call bugs bugs  refer to bugs as bugs 
Don't you dare try to escape!
Where did Haruna go...?
Ah! There's another Nessie!
i1To live and to die.
Of course.
Yo, what's your cup size, Tomonori?
You're an E cup...which means...
an8What are you doing?!
Leafy is busy doing some cooking, so look forward to it.
This is all because of Haruna. That's why.
How did it get like this?  No 
Very good luck, even.
All the preparations are done, Aikawa.
What's Shabu Shabu?
Boin X.
i1Time for the showdown.
Well then, let's have some cake.
I'm really hungry.
Here, Aikawa, hold onto my shoulder.
Aikawa, that was lame.
Sorry.
You still believe in ghosts at your age, Necromancer?
Rock 'n' roll, baby! More, please!
I think it's almost time for my magical powers to come back!
Aikawa shriveled up again!
Sounds like he has it made.
No matter how good it tastes, it's still only fried eggs.
I love this time of day.
Man, I can finally go home.
Hey!
You shouldn't drink that much!
Wow, I never thought my stress would manifest like this.
I can't take having to walk in the sunlight every single day!
What...
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Ayumu!
Doesn't this guy look a lot like Aikawa?
That's actually not what I had in mind.
What the hell!
You're not the fairy?
Who the hell are you?!
Why is your aura like that of a magical girl?
But I ate so much for breakfast!
It's not my fault!
Hiramatsu!
Haruna!
Fine.
Isn't he the guy from the magazine cover?
It turns me on!
eight-hundred... nine-hundred...
I'll settle this with one blow!
He's mumbling something.
Don't look at me!
J-Just ask yourself.
Darn that Ayumu!
My honor is at stake here!
Don't let me catch you doing that ever again.
Sera.
You exhibitionist clown of a lowly insect!
This is another one of the many thorn-laden paths that a chosen one must traverse.
Huh...wha...hey!
Ah, sorry!
Huh?
I'm so glad you're here today!
Tomonori?!
That might not be a bad idea.
All your stress just melts away when you see it!
Sounds great.
I'll go look for her.
Thank you.
Really?
Okay.
Huh?
Bee.. Bee.. Bee.. Bee... Boys be ambitious!
Guh... Guh...
I can't see!
A bear's chasing us!
I'm just worried about you!
Huh?
Watching the stars with everyone...
Yeah.
the iron chef, Haruna-chan!
Everyone's just out of their minds.
If you just cooperate, then I won't harm you.
I knew Onii-chan could pull off such a fabulous dress!
You two praise him too often.
That's a great idea!
Long ago, a philosopher named Hegel from Germany came before Napoleon and said this:
Common sense, morality, and sympathy.
I really want to get my peaceful life back.
Haruna, when's he going to get better?
I want everyone to know about you, so
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Is now a good time to talk?
That's supposed to be common sense for Villiers.
What?
Mysteltainn was damaged at the scene!
Later.
so eat them when you're free.
I told you to make it oblate!
What I need is courage.
I'll try harder.
Cheers!
Actually, Sarasvati is going to perform a live concert.
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
Repeat.
And turn!
W-What the hell...!
Aikawa.
What is it, Ayumu?
And I become a hit!
Y-Yeah...
I'm the only one you should do pervy stuff to, you know?
Orito.
You're the one who needs me!
Beats me.
The super Curse Dance is complete!
The King of Night...
so I can't get married anymore.
I see.
Sunday.
Not Full Metal, it's the hero from Villier!
Scale models are wonderful.
Ah, thanks.
I made it into a cosplay cafe.
Another one of your stupid ideas?
What's wrong with these people?
Now, eat your food and get out, master.
They're not panties! They're pantyhose!
Sera?! What are you doing here?
I did notice that you left the house occasionally.
You could say that Saras rented me out.
Aikawa, I'm so happy you came!
Everything here is tasty, you know.
This restaurant is odd, but the food is great.
Yes, it's not over until you've had dessert.
That's robbery!
I'll have you pay with your body if you fail, my damn darling!
Are you ready, pathetic lambs?
I mean, filthy swine.
Wow, this ain't bad.
Seems so.
Okay.
Hey, are you alright?
Drink! I'm the one serving here.
Seraphim the Tsun will be serving you!
Those words will only encourage Orito.
Please.
Understood.
I tried using nitroglycerin as the secret flavoring.
Good afternoon.
I won't ask you about the details, but it freaks Taiko out, so keep it to a minimum.
Let's do it together.
Here, scroll of the earth!
Making sure that Ayumu doesn't try anything funny with Hellscythe-dono.
I'll manage even while you're gone.
An older sister...
i1so I can't do the shopping.
Thanks, Eu.
I-I know!
What? You feel hard...
i1I can do it.
Can you eat porridge?
Okay.
i1She's from the underworld.
i1I know!
Are you busy?
an8Aikawa?
Eu has a fever.
an8Fever?
Go!
Go!
Anderson-kun!
an8You don't feel anxious anymore though, right?
What was that?
Ayumu.
Yeah.
This is pretty rare.
Stay by her side...
Yes, for us denizens of the underworld,
Is there a cure?
Well, I do have an idea.
There's a limit to desperate measures!
Whatever it was, I'm just glad that she's well now.
i1Sera will be speechless if she sees this.
i1Let's clean it up later.
Isn't your face a little red?
Anderson-kun, Haruna is sick too.
Only those from the underworld can catch that disease.
i1at least through the tough times.
Hey.
My teacher is at the forefront of omelet research.
Well, I think it's a good idea.
I like that.
Huh?
The menu will feature entrees made from eggs.
Schools are great!
and there are people who can teach you how to make things.
This guy's a lunatic!
Damn it! My doctor told me to stop spouting smooth lines.
Yeah, please.
Okay.
You thought I wouldn't see through it?
I see.
Thank you.
Oh, nice idea.
Oh, great!
Hm...
It looks like it'll be a hit, doesn't it?
Oh, wait.
But look, his girlfriend isn't another boy.
I'll be back!
S-Sensei!
You look good, Ayumu.
Strange.
an8Lose blood and die, cha cha cha.
Yeah.
Who's there?!
You're the guy from before.
The ring?
How's this?
A-A-A-A-A-A wedding ring!
Got it?
Haruna!
I can't reach the trigger.
Huh! I'm listening! I'm listening!
It hurts!
That was great!
Wow, I didn't understand a single thing.
Look here. All I want to know is how you got your mana back,
What about you? You're not in your swimsuit.
Tomonori.
Aikawa-senpai, won't you accompany me today?
Yeah! We're gonna have Deluxe Azuki Soba Noodles, on the house!
What did you say?!
Okay. Make sure Haruna doesn't get into trouble.
Seraphim, you don't plan on walking around in that outfit, do you?
Hm.
Excellent! Marvelous! Great!
I will!
Accessories are violation of the dress code.
No!
Miss Fairy!
Your mana?
Is that Kurisu-sensei?!I'm leaving this as Kurisu because everybody thought that Kurisu-sensei was a normal Japanese man, hence his name should be Japanese.
Chris?Chris is the official spelling when she's in this form.
She must be some hotshot if Haruna remembers her name.
I would've bit my tongue and killed myself already!
And finally,
With this, I can speak and have feelings without any problems.
The reason that Haruna and Tomonori's CD couldn't sell was...
That's because of me too.
It's all because of me.
Yeah, yeah! We have a hypocrite!
When I woke up each morning,
A sight from hell...
Aikawa-kun, so you are a pedo
Yes! My heart may bend, but it shall never break.
I-I can't move!
You'd make a great drinking buddy.
I'll always wait for you, though.
You don't waste time, Aikawa-san.
That face again!
Kyouko-chan, aren't you satisfied yet?
But I can't remember how the hell I got home.
Let's go all out!
Aikawa, you want to throw a mixer that badly?
Aikawa put it together, though.
What's a mixer anyway?
The main characters are here!
Huh? We have to have even numbers at a mixer?
Hey!
God, help me!
No, it's okay.
You told me to!
A flash of inspiration! A great flash of inspiration!
Just call me that.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm coming, so wait for me!
I just had an idea.
You always make fun of others like that!
Isn't this where you defeated me?
Don't blame me if something bad happens.
my sentence.
Please, don't ever forget about me.
Looks like Ayumu-san did it.
Is it some complicated job-market-related problem?
Wah, I am!
The king hath decreed:
Noooo!
You look like lonely people.
Are you kidding me?
and the other is the Sovereign of Twilight from the Seventh Abyss.
I'll protect this world.
How utterly disheartening.
I live in the here and now.
That makes me...
W-What a warm and soft sensation!
Yes, yes...
She went back to sleep!
Hola.
Did you buy my food?
Do you still have it?
I hate beating around the bush, so I'll cut to the chase.
Haruna left excited about helping you...
That's not what happened! It's not!
I'll ask you directly.
That's right.
Hey, is that...
What are you doing, Ayumu?!
Oh no, I wasn't sleeping.
You keep glancing at the clock.
I can't beat Chris,
He's interesting.
Oji-san, one ganmo please.
Ayumu-san...
Now we'll find out how she makes fried eggs.
If you don't have one, you can put in a cotton ball instead.
Mix for at least 30 minutes at a high speed.
This guy sure is a gentleman.
You be quiet.
What will you do, Ayumu-san?
No!
an8No!
Wow.
That thing is a gentleman!
