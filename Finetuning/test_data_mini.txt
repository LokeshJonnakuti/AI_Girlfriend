Uncle!
Really? If so, that one's going to crash.
Sure.
You didn't get seasick on the way over, did you?
You think so too?
but you could go looking for a girlfriend too.
I haven't forgotten!
Right! Looks like she's headed for the Eiffel Tower.
We can really fly!
Where did you come from?
Good! You answered me.
Look, I'm sorry if I said something wrong.
That's not true!
Or else!
Is that so? Sanson!
Goodbye.
That was amazing!
Oh well, we know where she's headed.
Oh, very soon.
Then you have to earn it by working.
We're going to talk quietly and legally.
I'm your legal guardian, aren't l?
Hey, Nadia! Nadia, listen to me.
I can get away by myself!
Don't be so hardheaded.
Okay, here we go.
Sure, go ahead.
I have an uncle there.
That's wonderful! We'll go on ahead.
Okay.
Treat her good.
No es bueno!

Iroha Igarashi. She always cuts class, she's gaudy, sleazy, and disliked by the girls.
It's like everything I hate the most about 3D girls all put together into one person.
Ito! What's with those ears?! Even I have to draw the line!
It's done after we scoop the trash and add the chlorine.
Here.
I-it's shocking how insensitive you are!
I don't really get it, but you should fall in love or something.
What's up, Tsutsui? Your attacks are looking rough.
Oh, "Magical Girl Ezomichi" is gonna start soon.
You're gross as always, talking about magical girls and stuff.
He was also drawing pictures of girls with weird clothes.
Stop.
I-it's okay, Tsutsui.
Wh-who are you?! You're being rude!
You say some really amazing things without batting an eye.
What are you doing here by yourself on a Sunday?
I mean, you called me gross too.
Um, I'm not involved with this.
She's two-timing... She'll get what she deserves.
Iroha, we're going!
You gonna be a hero, idiot? You're so gross!
I know that. I get it, but...
Bastard!
I'm okay, so will you leave?
Go.
Who cares? There's nothing to talk about. Her words have no meaning whatsoever.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Why are you so late?
Huh?
It's okay, Tsutsui!
It'll be for a short while, but I'm looking forward to it.
Half a year... Am I ultimately just wasting time?
Congrats, Tsutsui!
I'm a gloomy guy! That's okay!
But they say whatever they want even though they don't know anything about you...
But that's okay. It's always been that way.
But...
I don't understand anything about her...
I don't know.
You mean you want to know the relationship between us.
It's an indefinable relationship?! Is that what it is?!
You sure are annoying.
Because it looks like she'd definitely be happier going out with you!
and I'm tired of being together with you!
in order to rouse himself up, he stayed up all night playing a hero game.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I only realized it when I was updating her medical records yesterday.
You seem poorly informed so I'm telling you that.
I..I don't know.
H-Hikari's brought a girl?!
Just sit wherever.
Oh, I was thinking this is nice. This side of you where you don't hide yourself at all or put up a front.
So this girl can use magic, huh? With my magic, I will make the smiles of the world bloom!
I-I-I interrupted something, didn't I?!
Right?
It's done!
Hikari!
What're they for, an amusement park?
Here.
How do you feel?
I will always absolutely cherish this.
At any rate, it sure is cute. Is this how cute I appear to you, Tsutsun?
I've definitely always had eternal bad luck in a place like this.

Ito, so you're going to the movie with Ayado after all, huh?
Is this, perhaps... the blossoming of youth?
Are movies and stuff fun?
Ugh, is that my ex?
You've gotten prettier, huh? Did you get a boyfriend?
It's okay, it's okay!
She's like me, but she's done so much talking, and always with a smile...
Yes!
Oh?
Morning...
Ito-senpai, here's your ticket stub.
I'm sorry, I took both of them home with me.
R-right! You two went to the movies together, huh? How was it?
It's alright. We all know what you can and can't do.
Tsutsui's being weird. He suddenly said he wanted to go on a picnic... Maybe there's something on his mind.
Huh? We have drinks!
Tsutsun?
You idiot! You're awful! So insensitive!
Right around here.
That one's mine!
D-did you have fun?
Tsutsui, I...
The person that I like is Ayado.
Wait! I didn't do this because I was trying to make fun of you!
I know that. Since it's you, you were trying to help me, right?
Tsutsui. Love is painful, right?
I mean, Ayado likes you,
I don't know.
Good luck, Ito.
He was stalking you, right?
Oh, younger brother?
Tsutsun! I'll make him apologize to you properly later!
Well, I guess you would worry if you have such a pretty sister.
They're broken.
Jeez, if you talked to him properly, you'd understand. He's very-
What is he doing here?
You're the one that did this!

Right.
I will always absolutely cherish this.
You've been coming home early lately.
Then I hope it goes as well as possible,
How you can properly put what you're thinking into words and then confront someone.
Before... I met Tsutsui, I couldn't show that to the people important to me.
Igarashi... please, don't laugh.
Properly saying that is embarrassing...
But you're happy after all, right?
Tsutsun.
Huh? Uh...
an5entire world
Mune wo utsu ano kotoba kirei da an1And think of those beautiful words that touched my heart
Yum.
Right? The wood carving of the bear gives a great atmosphere too.
Let's hurry up and eat and go home, Tsutsui!
Huh?!
That reminds me!
I HOPE IT EXPLODES!
I'll take your spot, Takeda!
an4Deciding our homeroom class presentation
Okay, anyone?
No.
What?
And our class never did decide on what to do for our presentation.
This could not be any more soul-crushing.
It's so reassuring to have you!
And they decided that we're going to use potatoes that I grew myself!
Really? That's awesome!
I-I'm... I'm on my way to talk to Ayado.
Ito-senpai?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Then she fell in love with my friend, and that was even worse.
Ugh, you're so annoying!
Ayado.
I don't want to waste that.
So I decided I'm going to be a better person.
I cut it. Because my heart was broken.
I gave them up.
But they're your whole identity!
There, there. I know just how hard it is to have your heart broken.
So that's why people keep begging me.
Like it's not even your problem.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I'll help in any way I can!
If that will make it better, please do!
And then, I'll tell her how I feel.
Thank you, Igarashi!
If you insist, I suppose I could do it.
The day may not be too far off when she dumps you.
an5I let myself get excited about being positive, and reality slapped me in the face.
an5I let myself get excited about being positive, and reality slapped me in the face. How careless can you be?! What are those glasses even for?!
Maid cafes get a lot of customers who are embarrassed to be there, too!
It's our job to instantly create an atmosphere where they can relax and enjoy themselves with all their hearts!
Welcome, Master.
Yeah, that was pretty tough, too.
We always get stuck doing this stuff.
I think you've changed.
I don't know what to say. Thanks, Ishino-
It feels like I'm...
Right?
N-no.
Ito, is that you?!
Excuse me! What are your cheeks turning all rosy for, YOUNG MAN!
Welcome!
This way, please.
If I don't do it right, it would be an insult to her.
Just don't overdo it.
and very handsome!
What? But our waitress is cuter! Ariel's awesome!
But now I'm bored.
...is what I mean to say, Master.
I'm so tired...
I think we can work it out somehow.
You ARE pretty.
Hang in there, Ishino.
At this point in time, she's in first place.
Full of confidence to the very end. You are infuriating as usual.
We have Miss Reiko Akiyama from Class 3-D!
But now that I've made it this far...
I just don't know anymore.
Last, but not least!
My hobby is walking my dog, and my best dish is boiled eggs.
What? Then...
I-I will now announce the winner.
Then why don't you tell me what makes me so great?
Well, you're nice, and...
The beautiful way you hold your chopsticks.
Tsutsui!
Yeah, it was alright.
I feel kind of bad.
But I...
Thank you.
And it's all thanks to you.
Why were they acting like that?
That's good to know.
Yay!
I should be careful.
I'm home.
What's that supposed to mean?
He was already doing his research then. He was modest and didn't really stand out.
I'm painfully aware of the fact that there's nothing I can do to help.
You have a wife and children.
Uh, no, I'm fine.
Uh, hey! Hikari!
I need sleep.
I-I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Oh, wow.
That's just how my life always goes.
I have thought it through.
We did have a bond. I trusted him.
Tell me you're joking! You can't do that!
but someday I want to see if we can use a jet. Even this truck will never pull them apart!
And I just figured, maybe I can't ask for any more than that.
I still love her.
They said Mom's going to Hokkaido.
So they finally told Kaoru.
If you're not gonna put in the effort, then you don't get to claim the same rights as me!
Because she's here.
Maybe I should go home and ask Dad!
I... I found her!
He's young, and still needs his mother.
But why?!
So your mom's going to reconsider?
The oldest really is the best.
You will come with me, won't you, Hikari?
Tsutsun.
That's okay.
I decided to assume the worst so I could be emotionally prepared for it.
I'm fine. I love Hokkaido's butter sandwich cookies.
But I hate it!
I'm sorry!
Hey!
You... know what I look like?
We had a day off from school, so I was at a restaurant with Hikari, and we saw you there.
The fact is, I really don't know how to handle this, either.
I will. Thank you for the takoyaki.
Huh?
I'm sorry.
You're the Chief's son? You look just like him!
You need to get away from my house before Mom gets back!
Uh, I'll just... go get us some drinks.
And...
Goodbye, Ayado.
What are you doing all the way up here?
First Tsutsui, now you.
Huh? Like what?
Well, you know. Like s-sleepovers?
That's... okay. I am so, so, so sorry!
There he is!
And then she tells me all you did was have dinner?!
But Kono brought it all back to me. She helped me realize...
I'm sorry!
I have all the bad luck...
So hey, did you watch Real Boy?
Come on, let's go to dinner.
I'm sorry.
And as for how it works, there are three major categories.
Yeah, no kidding!
...with a woman like her.
What?
Couldn't you at least figure out that much?
Somehow, you always manage to see me in the most awkward situations, don't you?
I promise you, there's something out there that only you can do.
So you're just giving up?!
Going out to dinner helped me realize how very precious each of them is to me.
But you left me all alone, all that time.
Is more wonderful than anything
What's the matter, Ayado?
Why are you the only thing I ever think about anymore?

There were a bunch of them growing in the school flowerbeds.
But we're only in middle school!
He was a side character in a shonen manga.
At first, it was easy to think that their opinions didn't matter, but...
I won't let you go again.
But what happened?
Tsutsui? How dare you talk to me like that?!
It all worked out for Ito.
Look, Kaoru is blushing! See?
You know... she is like a part of the family! I-I'm not blushing.
Well...
Oh! I had some shopping to do, so you can drop me off here.
I just don't get it.
It wasn't exactly a good time for it, with the Oshamambe scare going on.
Huh? Umm, well...
Wh-what do I do...?
Does this mean now I get to experience it all with Ito-senpai?
I-I can't stop fantasizing about it!
All because I've read so much manga on the subject...
I-I-I'm sorry!
I'm being too self-conscious!
I can tell from looking at you.
No, um...
And he's told me so many times that he loves me!
It's not what you think!
Ayado?
I love you, Senpai!
It's because you were always there for me...
You did just tell me not to hold back my real feelings, didn't you?
Are... are you sure?
I know you hid your pain all this time, so you could be here to support me!
What a relief.
Thank you, Ayado. I feel better now.
I do not. Want a girlfriend... Want a girlfriend...
Come on, who goes to a ramen place with her crush and asks for a second helping of rice?
No one will notice me. I know that
The bottomless sky keeps accumulating
That pain, remember? What was it?
Yeah.
The boy I started dating last week, Ito-senpai.
I think it's great!
Uh, o-okay...
Again?
What, you have a problem?
It's always ramen.
It was your idea! Try to be excited!
Yeah.
By the way, in our family, oden isn't hotpot. We put it in the "simmered food" category.
Apparently because the cooking process is "more damn trouble than it's worth."
I'm home.
Hotpot. Got it.
How about your next three-day weekend? I'm sure you don't have plans.
Big Brother.
It's hard to explain. I don't really care... what she thinks of me.
Are you going to be like this all day?
I don't think my foot is supposed to bend that way!
You told me you would be playing with your friend Kirara today!
You're still in grade school! We're going home, Anzu!
Hey, wait a minute!
I know you're her brother. But that's no reason to tear them apart like this.
L-let's get out of here, Kaoru!
Why are you following me?
I want to make you feel better.
I really am sorry about today.
Ow!
Ugh.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah!
If I go home, then I don't think they'll ever let me see you again.
K-Kaoru...
Kaoru was saying we should go home.
Me? Like him?
Ishino, your feet...
Here! This is for you!
A cell phone cover?!
The white breath is the fading future future
Whether again or for the first time, show me your childlike face
What are you, in fourth grade?
Why are you blushing over something like oden? Are you stupid?

Takanashi!
You don't see them together every day.
Ito!
Hmm. I'll think about it.
He's obviously worried about something.
What is this?
Then what did he want with you?
"Done it"?
Hm? Uh, what? Who are you?
You remember! I was with Micchan at the school festival!
It wasn't easy, either!
Okay, Arisa.
N-no, no, no!
then plunged me into the depths of despair.
Micchan!
Eh? This is Ishino. Are you serious?
I see.
Really?
Ito, my friend, have you already gone to the other side?!
And yet you won't tell me about it. You're making me sad!
Tsutsu-
And I kinda think, when we're alone together, things might start to move very quickly into that territory.
I want to go on a trip!
Well?
Beats me.
Don't be so demanding...
I don't know.
Ah, to be disgraced by Tsutsui. Oh, the poor girl!
I know...
Where exactly are you hoping to go?
Whoa, Tsutsun! Slow down.
Wait!
She said she wanted to go on a trip the last time we had a long weekend, too.
That's harsh...
He's actually treating me like a boy would treat a girl on a date.
Nanimo iranai saa ikou
B-but I can just skip those!
Let's have lunch!
You have a good mom.
Don't eat it!
Oh, yeah! The pancake place by the station is crazy good!
Good, you're here. Takanashi!
I'm so sorry, Anzu. Mitsuya.
We're just glad you're okay!
Is something wrong?
So it's just you and Anzu for three days?
Yeah. It's only three days. We'll be fine.
I make it all the time with my grandma.
Ugly four-eyes.
If I say, "Yeah, good to see you," can we be done here?
I just don't want you breaking my glasses again.
The only thing I want is to make her wish come true, that's all.
Well, we're not going on a trip this time anyway.
Wow, not many kids your age like it.
And of course if you love someone,
Your brother just worries a little too much, that's all.
Because I felt like I was opening a door to a frightening world.
I lost again.
I've gotten 100 on this game.
That's really good! It's different than our usual gyoza! That's called gelatinization-
I think I'm going to eat too much.
Your mom, and dad, and Kaoru are all so nice.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Together forever...
an5Chuo General Hospital
Could you meet the person you wanted to meet?
Oh? But you can do whatever you want to, you know.
And you said we could game all day today!
Sorry.
This is the first time I've seen Ito looking so sad!
I'm an idiot!
Somehow, she seems kind of sad.
Matter of fact, you can even talk all about your love life, as much as you want!
Maybe... something might have happened.
I can't possibly say that I was in the middle of a day dream about you, right?
Everyone that's in some kind of romantic relationship probably gets weird like that.
Like when you're in front of that person, your demeanor changes, right?
Meow, meow, meow...
You're a gloomy guy as it is, so you already have that handicap.
Huh?
Do you hate me now?
But I'm curious, you know!
Ow!
They're not gonna do that!
I can't shake the feeling that this isn't something I should express to her.
If put it like that, then I might understand what you mean.
Sorry. There's something I want to watch on TV today.
This is as unexpectedly skillful as the figure, huh?
You sure are open-minded.
Yeah. Ishino is a good person.
Haven't you heard?
Huh?
I-Is that so?
Yeah! He's so cool!
I'm jealous of everyone... Love looks like fun.
Hug...
an7Tsutsui, who turns to dating sims in order to understand a woman's mind
A woman's mind is too difficult! It's a game, but I'm still shocked!
I know. You're well-known for a lot of things, huh?
I personally just got really pissed off.
I understand the feeling you have of liking someone that much.
It's good to eat a lot.
Today, at any rate, I'm kinda glad I'm a bit of a normie.
Ts-Tsutsui...
Good morning!
I went to the amusement park with him and Anzu and Takanashi.
Arisa!
Because we're dating.
Nanmo nakatta ka no you ni
Ano hi no kimi o misetai
Thank you... Ayado.
It did change my world.
This is kind of embarrassing.
Whoa, look at this!
Well, it is kind of a tradition, I guess.
What?
And while I'm at it, I'll knit you a stomach warmer or something.
Nevermind. You're my mother, so shouldn't you be talking to me about my future?
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself.
Are you ready yet?
I know the doctor talked to you.
You have to stop-
I'm running out of time.
I'm going to use every minute I have left to do everything I can.
But if Ayado and I keep going, building our experiences one step at a time,
Thanks.
Yeah!
Oh, but it's too cold for that, Tsutsun.
But Tsutsui is smart. Maybe the studying he does at home will be enough?
I'll never make fun of an anime movie again.
Which is more important?
But...
You need to cool your head.
Just...
Tsutsui! What's wrong?!
Don't think you can get into college with that attitude.
Stay out of it.
Sorry.
Cold! Now you've done it!
And you know... you didn't have to throw seaweed.
that his grades have been getting really bad lately, too.
Really?
Shinpai nanka nanimo nai
But at least we managed to get to a clothing store before it closed.
Er, um, do you rent out rooms here? Could we stay the night-
Hmm, I guess we were a little too spontaneous.
And now we're not going to make the last train.
The bottomless sky keeps accumulating
We're closed, so that's all I have to offer.
The missus ran out on me not too long ago. And I can't run an inn all by myself.
It happens... all the time?
You're such a total babe, why are you dating such a plain-looking loser?
But man, young kids...
My first love was ages ago. Seeing you experience it in the present progressive tense, you're making me jealous.
That old man just talked and talked until he passed out.
Oh! I'll go buy us some drinks.
The truth is...
Uh, yeah.
The train will be arriving shortly. Please stay behind the white line.
Okay... see you later.
You'd better have a very good excuse.
So... so how was it?
Arisa's got good intuition, if nothing else.
Okay.
She hasn't been to school in about three days.
Please let me talk to her!
Go away!
He's launched a full-blown stakeout!
Oh, it's just colder than I expected. I had to get some supplies.
And you're never going to come to school again?
Can't we at least stay together until your last day?
I can't really stomach the idea of saying goodbye to everyone.
I got to meet you before it was over.
You led me by the hand
Whether again or for the first time, show me your childlike face
I don't need anything. Now let's go
Hey, there he is!
But...
No.
She's...
Stop it.

But that's no reason to give up on everything.
Don't get depressed yet! You'll jinx it!
What am I supposed to do?
This is the one time in his life you could stand to be nice to him, Takanashi!
...it's no use.
For some reason, you're the man Igarashi chose to spend her last months with.
Because you are going to live on into the future.
Tsutsui is so amazing.
I wonder...
Another good episode.
I record every episode, too!
Congratulations. I wish you years of happiness.
You work for a pretty good company, Takanashi.
I see. Good luck, Breadwinner.
Yeah. Thanks.
So you actually DO have a decent prospect!
Yes.
I'm sorry.
It's on me today.
And we're all moving forward on our own paths.
I don't mind carrying this pain.
I'm much happier than I ever would have been If I'd lived my life without meeting her.
Next, let's...
I told you before that we're not biologically related, right?
I admired you all that time. I love you, Iroha.
Let's go back to Los Angeles.

It was a stretch, me being 25 and all.
It's not like I'm gonna remember anything now.
You really mean a lot to me, Chika.
You were such a spoiled baby.
It's been a while.
or about you.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
Don't worry.
You were a kind, caring, wonderful person.
What is this? Why do I have it?
Thank you for coming, Ito.
But the baby just kept growing!
Tsutsui, are you about to cry?
You don't get to cry before me!
Igarashi?
Igarashi.
You know, we did send her an invitation, but I guess she couldn't make it.
I was nervous, but I'm really glad I came.
Oh, that was really great. When you remembered Ito.
Tsutsun.
All I wanted was for you to be alive.
Don't go.
I won't.
It's okay!
Feelings we've never felt before,
That kid's already way bigger than the last time I saw you!
Well, I'm divorced now.

Uh, yeah!
I can get just a little carried away.
What's with that reaction?
No. It was sudden, so it was a bit...
If you're gonna come in, be bold and burst inside!
Only bad feelings!
Oh man, he really came!
Am I going to be beat up?
Why?
You think I'd do something so despicable?! That's disgraceful!
Then why is Igarashi dating someone like you?
That's not what I mean!
There's no way I could do tha-

You heard the rumors, right?
That was a joke.
But...

I am disappointed in you, Tsutsui. You really are gross.
You mean to say you like that otaku that much?!
Huh? What happened, Kaoru?!
You surprised me.
Was today okay for you?
At any rate, they can crush my spirit at will.
He's the best guy in the world.
He's seriously gross.
Not until everything blows over.
Thanks! You're so pretty, miss!
Yes, I do.
Igarashi and... Anzu?
Well, thank you for taking care of my sister!
It's because you told me to yell!
A-apologize?
It's okay. I'll do something about this.
I'd rather be called creepy and have stones thrown at me. I hate scaring people.
Shouldn't I be the one who says I'm not doing anything?
Hey, that guy... isn't he the one that everyone's talking about on the streets?
Did you just notice that?
Also, there's a previous instance of you hitting people with your bag...
Do you like her?
That's somewhat thoughtful...
You're stupid.
It's because he gets along super well with your sister! Is that why?
Hey.
That isn't true. There are things that will pay off if you work hard at them.
I can't tell if you're being gloomy or optimistic.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Tsutsun, the part of you that's tolerant like this...
I'm late, I'm late!
M-me too! Glasses, glasses...
HERE IT IS!
It's a minor part of it, but the modeling and the interviews are fulfilling too!
Oh my gosh... The perfect 3D girl!
Senpai, you're a normie, aren't you? I made a selfish mistake that we were equals...
But I even looked up how to put it on on the net...
Yeah. I enjoy watching you having fun.
Thanks for waiting.
Turning my feelings into words is hard...
Maybe they're the type with a happy family...
Well, he's a hot guy...
I'm angry!
And after I had all that fun, too...
Uh, yes?
Oh, sorry. I'm looking for someone right now.
What?! What's with that condescending attitude?!
She's seriously gloomy.
Ayado, what anime do you like?
And this season, Gunfire Sentai is very well done.
Especially with pink being an ex-bar hostess, that's a novel idea...
That's because I'm weird...
I don't understand other people's emotions very well...
What are you doing?!
Take another look in the mirror! My... solar... plexus!
That isn't what's wrong.
Huh?
I don't want to continue fighting.
Thank you so much for cheering me up yesterday!
I was thinking I would live on with pride in my body.
If you lovingly take care of them, they grow quickly and they respond to you simply.
It's nice that Ayado is honest.
Use all of that brain tissue you can!
Oh, I can't. I have something to do.
Lately there's just been so much going on, that I couldn't give you attention!
I'm lonely...
The loneliness won't stop.
Don't ignore me, otaku. Say something.
It fell over there.
Why are you trying to correct me even though I have no plans to hang out with you in the future?
Ugh, what a pain!
Alright!
But not just Ito by himself. We need at least one more person...
Well, I guess he really isn't coming, huh?
Where should we start?
I-I don't particularly treat people kindly for my own benefit!
Since I'm thinking "I don't want to be hated by Machida and his friends,"
I just bought that!
I'll make it up to you!
If Ito hates me now,
Okay.
Idiot.
No... Sorry.
I-I'm going home.
So he's being extreme again...
Ishino...
Did something happen, Igarashi?
I'm happy that you could lean on me. I'm all ears, Igarashi, so speak freely!
Igarashi, why are you holding anything back with that four-eyed otaku?
Daremo shiranai koto nanda Is something nobody knows
Kaze ni notte kumo no kirema ni Romance in pale pink
Ichiban daijina kotoba The most important words
"That girl"?
It's not "nothing," though...
Oh, sorry, did I get you Ayado?
Hey, this happened cuz you're goofing off!
I'm sorry.
It's just like Ishino warned me it would be...
I'm gonna cast my secret spell!
Sorry.
You... Even though I warned you, you made snacks for that girl again...
Is it okay that I'm here?
Even though I was invited to this lovely party, since there's no way I can do one single party trick...
Huh? But-
Ayado, you really don't have to bring anything.
Yeah?
an5Th-that's undoubtedly true. I mean, that's what I've thought for a long time now. She's going to dump you!
I don't get it!
Why in the world am I walking around the city with guys like this?
Wow, it's a maid! She's cute! Can you come with me next door?
C'mon, it's okay, you can be flexible right?
Um, I-I'm sorry...
Let go of her hand.
Unlike cabaret girls, it is completely forbidden to touch maids.
Sometimes I get uneasy.
This is fashion! They were chosen for me by Takanashi.
I've never been camping before, but I think I might want to...

I thought we'd surely have to do some survival activities and the like...
Tadayou no wa omoide no you na an1Like the palm of a hand which has begun to color
Tada oboeteiru koto wa And it's little different from a dream
Alright, food time!
We've gotta do something beastly somehow, don't we?
I can only make sweets.
Takanashi, you're a boy that cooks?! And you, Igarashi?
I'll go pick some edible plants or something.
Takanashi, do you really not have a girlfriend? Is there someone you like?
I feel no sexual attraction.
You seem like a pain in the ass.
Y-you hate me, don't you?
Of course I do.
Honestly, I didn't know it would go like it did.
Well, we've come all the way here, so even if I'm in a bad mood there's nothing we can do about it.
Wow, that's your third one!
You don't seem like that at all, though.
but she's been a maid, and she's great at cooking, and she can fish...
It's so warm.
You have some too, Cat Ear-senpai!
How Tsutsui felt at that time...
I-I'm sorry! You don't have to go to any trouble for me!
Tsutsui, ice!
Will you act like you didn't see that? What about you, Ito?
but it's extremely difficult to pry with people like that.
I was not peeking.
I'm sorry.
Hey... What a-
I don't know. Something else I feared has happened...
What? Did something happen?
I said... that I love Tsutsui-senpai.
Hey, did you have to say that at a time like this?
That's not what I'm saying, but do you really not understand anything?
Can I confide in you a bit, Ishino?
But as soon as I thought that, this happened. What do I do?
Saa sugu doa akete Come on, open the door now

I don't know the reason, but it's my fault things are like this, right?
M-my bad.
Ichiban daijin a koto wa The most important thing
And I'm sorry I don't understand the things that a normal person would.
I want to make up. How do we do that?
Wh-why do you think that?
I get that if you think about it any more than this, you probably won't understand.
It's 'cause you're lonely, isn't it?
Uh... Try to think about it normally.
Probably not.
You guys sure are close!
But you only draw girls! Draw a robot!
Whoa, sorry!
I thought I had sealed that away...
I thought I could express my feelings because I was so pumped that I had come up with something,
Can I say... that I love her?
A text! W-wait a second.
I-I love Senpai.
Uh... Um...
If you're talking about your cold, it's not a problem. If anything, that's Ishino's fault.
Er... "love"? Love as in...
Huh? I said, I love Senpai.
Tsutsui-senpai!
Senpai?
an5Idiot!
I'm a huge idiot... For real, I really am... Guys like me are...
I don't understand the reason, but it's my fault that things are like this.
Idiot, idiot, idiot!
What are you doing?
Did Ayado confess to you?
You don't even think about how much courage it takes to do that sort of thing, Tsutsui!
Is the fact that I'm bad with people genetic or something?
That's rude. Both your father and I have a relatively large amount of friends!
I have no time to provide for a NEET.
Ishino.
I'm sorry I made our camping trip weird. It was all my fault.
Huh? What are you doing over here?
No thanks.
Tsutsui's the reason why you're making that face, right?
He sure is stupid. For real.
That isn't true!
But you don't know that, do you? I'm a pain in the ass. I'm always pushing people.
For Tsutsun, I think there must be a love where they better understand each other that he can simply enjoy.
I think it's fine if you don't know about those. Igarashi, you're getting too lost here.
Thanks.
Ayado, you have a lot of courage.
I wonder what's good about a coward like me that can't tell his girlfriend he loves her...
And having to reject someone like her...
Sobietatsu fuan no tou ga Is the pillar of fear towering above it all
Nan oku kounen nayameba ii no darou?? an1For how many millions of light-years must I suffer??
Saa sugu doa akete Come on, open the door now
They'd outright reject her, right?
Hey!

Is that exactly why all we can do is confront each other every time?
an1Atarashii kisetsu yume to wa sukoshi chigau Leaping through time

I... could only see the entirety of you as good.
It was like, I was playing a game of catch with her.
The feeling of enjoying being with other people, the feeling of being happy to be liked...
and so since I've started to think things like that....
Hey, I'm the one who's embarrassed here.
I feel kind of... refreshed now.
Refreshed, huh? Amazing, you're strong.
I want to fall in love.
My words just got... really harsh.
Whoa, Ito, you look like you're enjoying this too, though...
Ito-kun, are croquettes, fried shrimp, and fried chicken okay for dinner?
You're sleepy, huh?
Okay.
What do you like about me?
Nobody really gets you, right, Iroha?
Hey.
What's wrong? You were spacing out...
Why not?!
Don't say that type of thing! Say that you absolutely won't do it!
But...
What do you mean "crap"?
B-but I don't, so you don't have to bother with that...
I haven't done either...
Well then, let's go do that!
Which finger goes where now...?
I didn't even think about my nails... Darn it.
I see... Then, here I go.
He's kind of... like a prince.
I'm hoping I can strengthen our relationship more and protect her...
What is?
But girls get kind of sad when you say it like that...

If you toss the chips in your hand at that girl, they just may be sparkling fireworks
Even better, it's not like there's anyone around.
What, want me to pull 'em back up for you?
And when I was three...
i recognize this backgroundHaving someone save your life is too stressful!
Even if she's a lunatic who claims she's from Venus, I owe her my life.
But let me go home and get some sleep first.
Here's your pillow.
Really?
Sure, the mayor!
So, what's he like?
I guess people say so. I don't really get it.
Calling him.
You're green! You're a green greeny!
Hey, cool it.
Whatever.
You're just wearing a kappa suit for the hell of it!
Are you okay?
You don't have a name yet.
You don't get to live here until I give you a name.
I christen you...
On my journey to pick up the pieces of my love
It won't protect me from anything!
By the way, there's something I want to ask you first.
Oh, right, I remember saying that yesterday.
No, just the one.
I've got plenty of newspapers.
Please, stop it!
A mysterious Greek illegally dumped it under the bridge.
Are you kidding me!?
Did this blanket come with it too?
I should probably go home and get a few things, though.
I'm kind of relieved.
You're such a pansy.
man must open his eyes amidst this stagnation,
There's no time right now for that, class starts in five minutes
If you don't say you like me, I can't hurry this feeling
Venus, girls are always caught up in romantic dreams
Wow.
Duh. Where else would I fish something up from?
After all, you're my lover.
Now that I think of it...
What do I do?
Well...
What's your favorite brand?
her name,
And then the Jupiterian said "My hands are the big bang!"
Can I look, or can't I!
Just like that!
Oh, so that's how you know what public indecency is.
It's the smell of the cleanser they used in the sinks at school.
This sucks...
When I was a kid, I had my dad wash my hair once.
Ko... It's time to pay me back.
Your hair's all stiff.
What am I thinking?
Who're you!? Are you from Earth!?
Huh, they all live on the river?
All right, let's get this fire going!
If you don't eat the bones, you'll waste away!
Of course.
Don't you remember that you changed your name?
Nino...
I'm Nino's lover.
We've got to go to Mass!
A priest?
Sister commands...
Amen!
That's not a sister, that's a brother!
Ni-ni-ni-Nino! Who's that!?
Be quiet. Mass is starting.
Me!
Is your love real?
I'll do my best.
If anything happens, feel free to come to me.
Even though we're never going to arrive
It's half-eaten, too!
I don't hate you, I just don't like you, I don't know what I'm feeling
Venus, she's always so lonely, don't look away
If you don't go beyond.
for the first time I learned the chill of cold air and the warmth of human hands.
Stepping off my everyday path,
I learned my own laugh which I'd never yet heard.
How is it supposed to work out!?
It's been so long!
They don't even have anything to do yet, do they...
If this were serious, I could take care of them all in ten seconds.
Plus, I think we can reason with them.
Wait, I thought he was a section chief.
We're running way ahead of schedule, so it's not like he's gonna tell us anything else.
Like he's just trying to get rid of us in a roundabout way.
You've changed, haven't you?
There's a lot of things I have to prepare at the office.
Of course!
I'm amazed.
What's this idiot talking about!?
That! One more, please, Ko!
How've you been?
Oh, no. Don't worry about that, Takai.
What'd you do, just come slinking back in defeat?
And why isn't there a stage?
Can't you tell from looking!?
What the hell are you all trying to make this!?
We can't change it!
Wouldn't your company would be doing the construction, Ric?
I was sure of it!
You don't know just how bad Ichinomiya is!
What's wrong, Ric? You look ill.
No, it's not Sister's fault...
Yeah, I feel great!
I don'y hate you, I just don't like you, I don't know what I'm feeling
Closer to you.
Nino!?
If I leave the river bank, they might decide not to build.
Hey, Nino, if you're asking for favors I'd be more than glad to help out.
Ric's final weapon comes online.
I, Ko Ichinomiya, personally guarantee its chances for victory!
Remember, Sister, watch your manners. You're supposed to be cute today.
Sure thing, Director!
Wait, I thought he was a section chief.
Yeah.
I hate to admit it, but...
Rest!
Who the hell do you think I am!?
dongs
I'm amazed.
Even a daddy has people he can't handle.
The land of their birth, a place with the lingering scent of joy.
Are we really getting kicked out of here?
That's my opinion of how you could improve accessibility.
Can't you tell from looking!?
Nino...
Just one little launch pad, and that would be enough...
I thought you both knew it was a done deal!
So work with me--
You don't know just how bad Ichinomiya is!
What's wrong, Ric? You look ill.
The contractor pulled out? Why!?
It's not a matter of when you call, it's whether you have to reason or the right to take up my time at all.
What's wrong, Ric?
All right!
He wants to put 'more than the CEO's secretary, not quite his daddy' on them.
A princess in clown's lipstick kisses you awake from your nap
Ric, you suck!
Gramps!
What kind of little kid is scared of those!?
Hey Nino!
C'mon! Wish upon a star!
I never knew you were such a tender romantic!
What're you so happy about all of a sudden?
Really? Then I could jump straight off Roppongi Hills!
Then I'll jump off City Hall!
I wish I can stay here with everyone forever.
Episode 96 "Phenomenon"so tempted to say 'oddity'
Why was it cancelled!?
Anyway. we've run out of things to talk about.
White lines, white lines, white lines!
The bloody, sweaty meteor cloud continued its fall.
Episode 97 "The Father of the Man Who Does Not Rely"
There's no need to mention that.
To tell you the truth, we're probably going to be chased out of our home.
See how hard my lover is working.
I kinda have something important to do!
I mustn't answer the phone that you retrieved for me.
That's right.
Why are you acting all high and mighty sitting there in your boxers!?
That's why you're training.
Yeah, we're starting with imitating the noises small animals make.
What's my subject?
The con cheo!
Hey hey, con cheo! Hey hey, Ric!
A wakeup kick for a greeting, my bare feet are always cut up
Even though we're never going to arrive
And although the plot doesn't really involve them,
Well... Oh, right!
Oh, that's right! Maybe I can have him take it all off!
Oh, Star.
I just saw Nino go into some animal's den.
Noooo!
I can't give up yet!
You're acting really shy.
What, is he trying to make me worry!?
M'lord Ric, are you nervous? 
Anyway, shall we get started?
Come on, Billy. "I love you."
The "Billy" in my name is from "rockabilly".
But... But I'm scared...
It's scary! What What if
You can do that?
Whatever! Even if I've never been to one, I'll use my skills and my enthusiasm to make something happen!
I've got a present for you.
I never thought you'd be so thoughtful. as to notice how much they wanted a park. ma
We all made an amusement park.
Wait
Wow, there's even a mascot?
Welcome. he ends his lines with squirrel. fuck. this. it's un-bear-able.
Why are you wearing a suit over a suit!?
Hey, you two. Beat the crap out of him.
Hello there, Stella. Would you like a ride?
Don't smile so much when you say that!
Be careful, kids! Relax for a moment, and!
Oh, the cast is Nino and the guys!
Wow, it's like the bullets are really flying at us!
You have to sell the fantasy first!
Well, I guess it was a lot of work putting a roller coaster up.
Welcome.
Everywhere's an amusement park to them, I guess.
Huh?
Tell me about that memory.
Just once, Dad took me there.
Hurry up, Ric!
My scattering emotions.
but when my lover Nino sleeps, she has a habit of sleepwalking to somewhere more comfy.
Yo.
I saw it all!
You can quit playing innocent.
Quit doing that introduction.
Anyway, this is all I need. now everything's set up
Fine, fine, I get it.
Well, a date... To be honest, we...
And you're still taking her home?
Oh, just to ask Nino out on a date.
If no one else is gonna take her out on a date,
Excellent! You're promoted! Promotions!
There.
Hello, Nino.
If it wasn't a joke, then what was it?
Let me explain the date!
Of course, it's specially closed-off just for us.
A top-notch orchestra and my engaging conversation as we enjoy our meal.
Wait...
What, you've already finished the sequel?
Well, how about Ve--
Oh, right. Nino.
Nino! Wai--
For some reason I'm always so lonely
I guess it only comes around once in a while.
a pretty boy in jeans climbs out! What an illusion trick!
There's nothing left for me but seppuku.
Caltrop!
A carefree kick for a greeting, my bare feet are always cut up
There's no time to be shy, you'll be gone in five minutes
The main dish is yet to come!
Yes. I was up all night last night studying it.
That's right. We're too close together for a first date.
The distance of hearts which understand each other!
Now we're officially masters of the sense of distance.
It's going well and we're finally on a date, so why don't I talk about something I can't normally?
I'm kind of curious about your past.
Well...
Yeah!
I have to go fishing now, too.
Here it comes...
This is a pain.
I'm always prepared to meet the enemy with full force.
Yeah, sure!
Stella...
How should I say it... While you're here, you can think of me as your big brother.
This place is probably run by a weirdo too, isn't it.
Calm down, Ric.
I'm Maria. Pleased to meet you.
Sister, I really don't like her...
That habit must be hot.
What, are you telling me you won't eat the cookies I made?
You're spraying blood!
What, we're done already?
Even she shows some concern?
I was trained not to in order to endure interrogation.
I guess I kind of understand where you're coming from,
Broken?
Behold...
The girl from the vegetable garden is the very picture of a klutz.
Don't act all familiar with me, you swindler!
Sorry.
Oh, Ric. This is P-ko.
Anyway, who is he, Nino? Someone from outside? I hate him.
Blighted eggplant?
Sorry, I hate peppers.
Really?
And they're deceptively hollow compared to how they look.
A karate chop!?
a Destructively clumsy!
It'll be okay.
I have to play along.
By the way, peppers are my favorite.
I've been growing them for myself,
but from today on I'm going to try to grow peppers you'll want to eat even if you hate them!
Huh?
Look at that figure.
Thus, no changes to her name!
I feel like being lazy.
Anyway, Stella it is.
P-ko, your veggies look as good as ever.
It's more than just skin-deep.
He looks like some villain...
Me, the next CEO of the world's number-1 conglomerate? lit. just "large company"
Yeah, Ric. Don't let it get to you.
Me?
I always thought we were on the same wavelength. inb4 people blogging about localizations that aren't
Ric. About our next major export.
I wanted to sing somewhere up high, so I came here.
Anyway, you're in my way. Will you move?
Nino comes every time.
Looks like he doesn't have the balls to put up a fight.
I studied every kind of music in a gifted program.
So, you say men who play music are popular with the ladies.
For some reason I'm always so lonely
Born of the same species.
All right, go ahead, Maestro Ric. ugh this shit again
The question is Nino's expression, though!
Wrong.
After all, if I take your job,
Total victory...
This should quiet him down.
How pitiful...
It's not like that bothers lit. "hurts or irritates" me anymore.
Just the howling of a loser.the dog thing doesn't work in english, does it.
I'm looking for work now.
Success in business goes to those able to discern the best-selling product for the market.
But even you wouldn't be able to easily figure out what will sell best under this bridge!
We can't! We can't swim!
If you can't breathe, it's fine if you don't, right?
For today, I'd like you to forget everything Nino just taught you.
C'mon, don't cry.
You may sink for a moment, but just relax.
I didn't hear a thing.
Kickboards?
We're really floating!
Leech, leech, leech leech leech leech!
Leechbro!
Even though I'm a youkai, when it happens it happens.
Huh?
Does this mean that leeches don't catch colds?
I have no intention of losing to germs!
you need to drink plenty of water, stay warm, and get some sleep.
Sudden changes in body temperature are bad for you. lit. "a poison"
I'd call you a hypochondriac old lady.
Don't say that.
He's free to be a leech if he wants.
This should do it in one dose!
but they're not listening to a thing I say.
Fireballs are plasma!
That day, on the playground
Even though we're never going to arrive
The kappa to float away. 
Ill be graduating from Tokyo U with straight As.
Come here for a moment.
Ill cry and spit up.
I can take care of myself.
Yeah.
I got it when I dove in earlier.
Right, that was how it was.
No
Seriously, anything at all?!
fall in love with me?
Whats up with that?
Ill come whenever possible.
Earlier, didnt you say
Im moving.
Thats right.
The view is fantastic, but
Leave it to me.
Like, whatre the Village Chiefs traits?
In addition, I have great looks and fine style.
Well, its not like hes a carp.
You called?
What is it?
No matter what living thing it may be,
feel lonely.
Hes not a kappa!
I was not. Thats just a mechanism of this body.
Thats right. This is disgusting. feels horrible
Fine. It doesnt matter anymore.
Oh. Havent I introduced myself?
Futon? mattress
I was being nonsensical yesterday
But a cloth is still just a cloth!
No, wait.
that means youre from the Carrier Pigeon Society
Th-That means
Its incredibly warm and fluffy.
Greece.
Your lovers happiness is your happiness.
Okay. Its great that youre really glad.
Nino-san feels like a normal person.
Id blind myself. Thats what the kappa warned.
Well, Ill be fine in a normal temperature.
Well, this feels quite nice.
This is a lifestyle that people would admire.
Even though this is due to a debt I created,
Youre already in, arent you?
Youve not eaten anything since yesterday, right?
because youre my lover.
Im all alone with her in my room!
What brands of goods do you like?
What did you watch on TV yesterday?
All I know about Nino-san is
She lives under a bridge.
Thats it!
Whats the matter?
Sorry, but bear with it.
Theres only one question here now.
No.
By the way, Rec,
Its from the cleanser thats usually used to clean school sinks.
Whats your reply?
Yes, sir.
Rec?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure is.
I should be asking you.
Built it?
Ni-Ni-Ni-Nino-san. Whos that person?
Those of you whove done bad things, raise your hands!
Youre Recruit, Ninos other half, right?
but my determination is real.
Well, rather than rumors
Well, Nino did choose you.
Hey, thats just candy, isnt it?
Its half-eaten, too! alt: leftover
On such a big planet,
I know Ive begun living under the bridge,
wanders aimlessly and indifferently in search of comfortable places to sleep.
Sister!
how far have you gone with Nino?
Because of his profession, Sister can see through every lie with 100 accuracy in the confessional!
for your hearts sake, test the water with your foot first, right?
Dont you need to verify that lies dont work on me?
How many times has she stayed over so far?
Id etch it on my calender, notebook, and even in my heart,
And every year
Its true.
Enough of this already.
How the hell can I believe that?!
How about taking that with joy?
So, Recruit, you
I what?
Well, in this case, I guess we could make up.
Youre a joke, Rec!
looking at you, you dont look like the popular sort.
In place of the useless guy who never takes her out,
Nino-chan, come and join me.
but I didnt think she would be this pleased.
So, Recruit
No, its not.
Why are you going back?!
Please wait!
Could it be I chased you away?
I would really love to go,
but the gravity is, well, you know
Now that I think of it, the magnetic gravitation corresponds with the gravity and integrates
When does Nino-san bring up the topic of Venus?
You planned all that.
Pass!
Even though it is just the entrance to this river,
Yeah?
Its been twenty minutes since then.
Does it take that long?
This is bad.
Everyones so eager, too.
Its long-awaited, after all.
Oh, but compared with my mothers home-cooked meals, the food here tastes better.
Next time: 4 Bridge.
You were under the bridge and decided what to have for lunch.
Its always a happy day for me.
And...
A young couple walking on the riverbank.
On our first date, Nino-san wished
Hey, Rec.
Yes, what is it?
Are the dates you spoke of
I studied through that last night.
Impressive, Nino-san!
Thats right.
Yes! Thats it!
We can do this, Recruit.
It celebrates the completion of the sense of distance.
Hey, Rec.
Yes! Carrying the princess!
Carrying the princess?
Itd be faster to try it.
The front!
Yeah, my arms have reached their limits, too.
Somehow, a date spends your physical strength.
As I thought, being with Nino-san at places other than the bridge is
Yeah. Thats it.
Come on, Nino-san.
It moved with such a small amount of stimulation.
Shall we go too?
Sister, whos that girl?
Yes! Well do it!
Theres a pressure to speak up now, even though I know its babysitting
I feel sorry for Nino-san and the rest,
She doesnt have any relatives, does she?
Of course.
i1Taimai?i0
No, Im not talking about rice.
Ive always retaliated with all my might, though.
That is it.
Lets battle.
Mistake!
On purpose?
You have to win the battle to be the Big Bro.
Yes!
Oh Yeah.
Why do my enemies keep increasing in number?
Hey, Rec.
Here you are.
Maria-san?
Your reactions are great.
Sure, I have some.
You really have no reactions at all, Sister.
Next time: 5 Bridge.
bord0blur0.6How you live your life, oh yeah. You know it's a total joke, but you're too dumb to see.
bord0blur0.6It's all you...
Youre bleeding profusely!
A vegetable patch.
She looks like a pretty decent kid.
If you werent, youd have fallen for the trap at the entrance!
Youre terrible.
This girl
During winter, I travel to seek out seedlings.
So, Nino, whos this guy?
Ive already gotten used to not being welcomed.
Sorry, but I hate bell peppers. capsicum
I seldom see such big tomatoes.
My vegetables are the best in the world!
Somehow, she has the look of a professional.
for the many cucumbers and that glance in the near future.
but since Sister gave Stella her name,
Is that really okay?!
Stella-chans so cute
Well, when you look at her like this, she sure is.
Freeloader, huh?
Oh, but without Ninos love, you couldnt be a freeloader, right?
Rec had an expression of true anger for the very first time because of Marias suggestion that he was a freeloader.
Hes not even moving
Success.
Since I was born, Ive received the best education for being a leader.
Even at this age, Ive already started various enterprises

Basically, everyone contributes in some way without compensation.
even this person works?!
Huh? Me?
Im the same as Rec-kun.
Ive always thought that we were on the same wavelength.
I think Ill use a freeloader.
Youre pretty lively considering its so early, Hoshi.
Youre awake so early today, Rec.
Well, a freeloader wouldnt understand such refined feelings, right?
Men who play music certainly are cool, huh?
First, you gouge, and gouge,?
Even love.
You or me?
Oh, Rec-kun plays the violin?
All right, we each get one solo piece.
the best of all.
I love you!
Look at that, Rec!
Shes so bored that shes fallen asleep, hasnt she?
This challenge
Well, even though youre in charge of music under the bridge,
Additionally, give up on Nino-san.
Complete victory.
Yes. Thats right.
And after that, Hoshis new song

Just shut up!
What an accusation...
You have superpowers just like us, Ric!?
Ric...
If you wait until the men from the lab pick up on your esper brainwaves
What's this balloon thing?
Wow, it really does! It's so exciting!
So you want a turf war, is that it?
Looking at it, it wouldn't be like her to come to school normally.
Do you know the story about soda bottle rockets?
What is it!?
If you all write a wish on a piece of notepaper and launch it,

I'd better take care writing this.
Fine, fine, I get it.

Oh sheesh, Nino-san, thats easy for me.
Okay, folks, class is starting.
I guess thats fine too...
Youve got to be kidding!
She has the big sister role, after all.
Both of you,
Whats that supposed to mean? Remember? Im a demon.
Im hear to work on my new song, Class Rumble.
Rec-san.
Itll be too late if the crazy men from the lab detect your esper brainwaves!
Its not tough enough to carry people,
Nino-san is being her usual lunatic self,
and the Brothers are being more docile than ever.
When you start your business on someones turf,
If youre so poor that you cant pay your protection money,
You called yourself a teacher
Wow!
Got a problem?!
Im not here to take your class. Im just killing time for today.
Well, even teaching a little bit is good.
Yes!
Im a good girl.
Plus, Ill be gone over the winter.
Its going to be a bloodbath!
A car, eh?
Turn it left and it gets shorter, and vice-versa.

No, thats not what I meant.
You like flowers? fixed -kBaraka
i1Two shadows creep into Rec's room.
i1Secretary Takai,
Oh my goodness, Rec.
Mirror?
Oh, it's a lighter?
i1Dang, that was a nice dodge.
Besides...
War?
You can step back now!
Why do you say that, Master Ko?
Please introduce us.
i1I can't cover up any more weirdness!
Ah, so that explains the costume
Nino... Niino... Miss Niino!
No!
Mr. Takai?
Girlfriend? So is she...
NOOOOOOO!
Fudge buddies? That sounds nice.
Ah, a new nickname to follow Moochyman, huh?
i1Just as I suspected.
i1Master Ko is certainly a genius in the business world.
C'mon, you hungry or something?
It's been 10 years since I began serving Master Ko.
i1My only focus in life was my work, and eventually my wife got fed up with it.
He seems happy, at least.
If he wants to ruin his own life, that's fine with me.
I have a separate presentation for him.
I knew it!
Starfish? I'm not sure. I've never tried before.
Yeah, I bet you're right! Then let's get to grilling!
She loves me, she loves me not, sh-sh-sh-sh
Hey, Hoshi!
Either way, he's lunch!
True... it's very well-designed.
i1Anyway, look how excited she is over a single present.
Help me out!
i1Unrequited love?
Even if every speck of hope is gone, I won't give up on my feelings!
Sauted starfish!
Yes, this is also...
Head!
You should probably get out of your enemy's sight. Fast.
Ahh, and so then you came here to warn
Just a little longer, my pets!
We challenge you!
Please help me, Rec.
Crapping yourself!
Feast your eyes on this!
Look!
Was that another war story? You're not just living out some fantasy, are you?
Do I have to give up?
My favorite magazine and cola.
Oh, yeah. I see him in here a lot.
But it's kind of strange how normal this place is, despite being just a little bit above the riverbank.
What?
I've discovered your secret!
You flesh-eating starfish!
Of course it's a friggin' mask.
I just assumed the whole "mask" thing was like your personal trademark.
Hey, missy.
Dirt!
Huh? Oh, yeah, for sure. But that's all in the happy past, now.
i1I shall investigate further.
Sure thing!
So I just shoved her in along with the bed.
Wow. A very impressive skit.
i1Hold a wish in your hands, and it will not shatter under the pressure.
i1No. Instead...
i1but rather to become the most beautiful lump of clay imaginable.
Ahh, truly this is the smell of summer.
Attention please! This is a drill!
I've cleared the surrounding brush.
Well, at least you reacted quickly to the fire.
Thanks, Sister.
Hey, wai
i1Why is Sister always so eager to please the Chief? I doubt Sister's intimidated by him.
Which leaves me, Whitey, or Sister.
Yeeaaah!
What are you doing?
We're all working hard here!
I know I am!
i1He doesn't even have a bucket.
No, for the upcoming construction.
Have you seen the area downstream? With the tennis courts and such?
I don't know what he's thinking,
Buddha says something similar:
Giving up already?
Hmm, the media would be bad news.
Enough of your fantasies!
And that should get me out of most any trouble.
What are you saying? Do you fully grasp the situation here?
i1I knew it! He's no ordinary man!
Brilliant.
i1We're dead meat!
Oh, here's the schedule.
i1Whitey's normally so calm and gentle, and even he's angry.
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are we gonna do?!
Whoa, so hot!
Didn't your mother ever teach you how to ask for a favor?
Did you happen to see the woman at the farm before coming here?
Would that be so bad? Life a little farther down the road might be nice, too.
Barley tea.
i1outside your comfort zone.
i1and closer to you.
I never should have let myself become so pessimistic.
Anything's possible.
You're looking good today, Sister. What's with the grisly getup?
As you can see, I've also disguised my weaponry.
I didn't want to add to Rec's stress while he's out there busting his butt for us.
Magic phrase?
Hey, Hoshi...
At this point
i1She's forgotten his face.
What, Takai? Just say it.
He wouldn't have tried to bury his son's home in concrete in the first place.
Perhaps... your father is just as afraid to face you
i1And...
You look well.
I'd be happy to transfer Miss Nino's hug to y
Yup. And I'll be bidding for construction rights, as well.
What is it?
Isn't this place enough by itself?
and Rec,
So your company isn't doing the construction?
Ah.
i1Maybe you're not scared since he's your father, but...
i1We actually sent a few guys down there yesterday to check out the area.
You're just gonna keep on dragging your stupid heels.
So come on! Wish upon your star!
Way to go! Hoshialways a man of his word.
What's your deal? You're enjoying this too much!
Not a chance! I've
Is that really something to be proud of?
This is just like a rollercoaster!
Plus, if it's for Nino
i1Listen, yelling at me won't help anything.
Could it be?
Love me back, love me back, love me back!
Venus, Venus, Venus.
i1Bleeding, sweaty shooting stars continue to fall.
i1Putting my pants up so high
i1Did he really think I'd climb up there to retrieve them?
Hey.
Are these yours?
"Never be indebted to anyone!"
He's sacrificed his entire body.
Back off!
Tell the cookies you're sorry!
You, too?!
Stop! Ah, I have to do something
Found it!
Try it, if you will!
No!
i1telling him the construction plans have been canceled.
Besides, all I brought is materials for beginners.
Beginners?
Topic:
Ahh... he just doesn't have the chops for improv.
i1but who wander in and out of each scene.
Yup. It's like twice as long as before.
Would you like a sample from my impression repertoire?
Well?
So then, Sister... what kind of cut would you
Anyone would try to dodge that!
Ahh.
Cram it!
Now that's true love.
Really?
Teachers are supposed to guide their students, right?
There she is!
It's so awesome!
Hey, come on.
True.
Whaaa?
No, no, no!
Not true, Rec! It doesn't even go all that fast.
Can we, Rec?
i1I can't believe he was able to build a rollercoaster for the kids in just three days.
Me first!
Make sure the belt and handcuffs are securely fastened.
All in all,
none of them seem to grasp the idea of a fair.
Look, Rec! Look what I got!
Yup!
We had

And as I progressed through grade school, my sense of self-sufficiency surfaced.
Anyway, now do you understand?
Am I... going to die?
What the f-?!
It's all too much, my unwanted savior!
Maybe just roll around?
Or I've got some tupperware you could use.
Cuz I'm a Venusian.
It's brought on by stress.
I should really get some sleep for now.
I'll just think of it as just one more temporary relocation.
Here we are.
I'm dead the second I roll over!
Anyway...
Ah, I think I get it.
Uh, okay.
No, I think that only works on koi fish. Humans don't generally-
We're very sensitive souls, you know.
The top part is totally vacuum-sealed!
You could at least try to hide it!
Are we done here? I'd like to lie down for a while.
That one's no good anymore.
Well, when in Rome!
Let me think. You're...
I dub thee:
But it sounds like he's just making fun of me!
Please give me a Japanese name!
Did you really forget?
Um, yes.
Well I'm all out. I just have the one.
Hey, could I have a quick tour of your house?
While I suffered the freezing winds and rough concrete,
Yes. I'm so very glad.
Well, at least my apparent lover didn't have to spend the night in the freezing cold.
2-3 Senseki
All right.
Well, I have to admit. I'm relieved.
we would use words like "happiness."

And then there's Nino.
What do I do?
But when I see her in a normal environment like this,
Sure, we're under a bridge. But this is the first time I've had a girl alone in my room.
Which means those kinds of topics are fair game!
Go!
Damn.

Haven't you played that game?
my wife will turn into a White Cornish chicken.
Recruit, we want you to tell us about you.
I had no idea this was here.
Might I still find emotional respite here under the bridge?
Sister?! More like a brother undercover!
He has an alarming scar on his face.
Me, me!
Nino, he's just tricking you all!
Take good care of Nino.
"I wanna beat the crap out of Recruit."
Recruit. I'm usually at the church, so come see me whenever you like.
You see... Nino has chosen you.
As the newest member of my flock, let me give you a word of blessing.

Hoshi?!
Sister! What's the meaning of all this?
Whoa! That's pretty amazing!
Hey, but wait... wouldn't those sleepovers count as dates?
No. We just go to bed.
But seeing how pathetic he really is...
I really do hate you. And yet...
You look like the kind of guy who only gets candy from his mom on Valentine's Day.
Hundreds.
This is the perfect date-asking-out fashion.
All those hundreds of chocolates.

Hello there, Nino.
Can't wait for the next skit.

What's a "date"?
That was... unexpected.
Date, huh?
but I guess I have no choice.
You know, if he hadn't saved me from those nasty delinquents that night-
This is a small gift to commemorate our first date.
A hundred different versions of Hoshi's stupid, utterly devastated face.
Well, Recruit...
Please stop!
I'll think about it, but you know how the Earth's gravity is.
What? What does that mean? What's your point?
I understand... then we'll put this on hold for another time.
My curiosity about her past has grown a little bit more.

You're there when I eat lunch!
For once, I was able to write like a normal student.
There's no way that you can understand the kind of person I am.
That's why,
Why couldn't you have told us what was occuring sooner?
With this...
Ric told his secretary a big lie.
Still, starting a company under the bridge?
It doesn't matter! I just can't let them find out the real reason I'm here.
It cost around three million yen!
Oh, what a nice suit!
He's a linguist.
Ko.
That's right! I still have Whitey!
But why, Ko?
He seems a fine humble man.
No, really, it's fine!

So the same as me. then.

Nope.
Ko, why do you have someone like this
Nino!
Um, that's nice and everything, but for now...
What? What?
No way!
Reciprocal cavity checks are a morning tradition at the Ichinomiya household.
Oh, Nino, you were there?
He'd distracted me up until now, but taking a close look,
That's...
If you can't even kiss each other once, oh man, I'll be honest.
You're lucky, Takai.
People are strongest alone.
I'm a starfish.
That day, a traumatized species of marine life was born.
Yeah.
Can't do a thing about it, though.
Oh man, I hope you're not pregnant!
Just from a kiss?
Yeah.
Yes, a bird.
I don't need that kind of advice!
That's all for the presentation.
Still...
Look at this.
Yes?
It's gotta be rotten by now.

WARNING: Absolutely no swimming! As Nino requested, we're headed to the mouth of the Arakawa River.
So on a "date," do we just keep walking around like this?
Stupid me. I was so focused on convincing her to go on a date, I didn't plan anything past that.
Alright, so... now what do I do?
Here's the most important thing in a relationship:
Sure thing!
What's our next distance?
Next comes... umm...
We really are the champions of proper romantic distance.
Ahh, I'm just so happy.
Recruit.
It didn't reach the sea.
There's only one thing I can do for her right now.
Rec!
Different Sex
Sachiel, ARMS!
Excellent. You're starting to look like a real squad.
England?
We can't just leave her here alone.
What? What is it?
I only had my father, but she didn't have any parents at all.
I've never really played with girls, but I'll give it my best shot.
The Commando.
Oh, wow! You dodged me!
That's nice of you, Rec. So you pretended to lose?
I seem to recall getting tossed into the air and slammed into the ground.
Yeah!
A pixie with a bad attitude? Am I hallucinating?
Rec!
Huh? She's being so polite.
She would never talk about being "Big Bro."
Heya, Stella. Yup, it su-

Cake ingredients.

Jeez, Maria's so brutal!

Especially when you make that creepy face.

That's all.

The twins certainly don't show any interest in what I have to say.
Okay, let's do it.

For real?
Ooh.

This is so exci-
You're one to talk about manners.

You call it "school." But it's really a violent armed militia training ground!

Why would I-?
There we go. Now let's take a look.

So I'm doing my best to pay attention and be extra caref-

I have to say, I feel like I'm the only one willing to help!

Oh my goodness, Rec.
What do you think you're doing?!
Dammit, stop making things so difficult!
War?
No, really, it's okay!
Looks like fun!
Of course I'd be honored to meet them, as well.
You mean, like myself?
As a veteran secretary, I must tell you this:
You haven't been coming in to the main office lately, either!
You really went all out, huh?
Fudge buddies? That sounds nice.
Yo! We're coming in, Rec! AKA-
- Get off me! - Oh, you're here too, Nino?
Yup, I'm here.

So obviously I could never-

I may have slightly overreacted earlier, but now it's obvious-
Master Ko is certainly a genius in the business world.
They can't possibly advance their relationship. In which case, it's not too late...
We're in the middle of a serious discu-
At the tender age of 21, Rec enjoys his first kiss.
Really? He always looks like this.
As you can imagine, Master Ko was always alone, whether at home or at school.
Please stand by his side for as long as possible.
Now then, I'd better get going.
I also heard he didn't look too happy.
He seems happy, at least.
- Anyway,
If he wants to ruin his own life, that's fine with me.
Please see for yourself.

No matter how much Sister might love Maria,
I love Sister a hundred times more!
Good. I shall go forth,
With how noisy she is? Of course.
You invited them?

Maria... I'd rather face the Death Omen Star than try to reason with her right now.
Sister, you have to put a stop to this!
Now's no time to worry about what she'd say-
It was love at first sight.
Was that another war story? You're not just living out some fantasy, are you?
Not a chance in hell! You haven't seen the last of Big Sis!

Why don't you climb down from there? Then you can say that.
Oh man, I'm really hungry.
Actually, I'm in the Chief's debt.
I don't see any reason why he should respect the Chief so much.
No, me!
Yup. Grown men should be closest to the fire, right?
Okay!
Yeeaaah!
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
Wow.
We're all working hard here!
Here's a pillow.
So what, he's blackmailing you?

I see.
There's a 100 chance this guy's going away for good!
He's right, though. Japanese people are vulnerable to this phrase.
Wha-?
You are?
There's something special hidden down here.
We're dead meat!
The only thing that will create is pickles.
Just yesterday I learned about the plan to develop the Arakawa riverside.
Just a second!
Nice place.
Huh? What's this mean?!
I thought we had more time.
It's not the Ministry doing this, Whitey. It's actually...

Yes, well... I'm here today to make a little request.

I'd only need ten seconds against a group that size.
Magic phrase?
Hm. Maybe I should give it a shot next time.
You'd be perfect if we were at a theme park.
Man, I'm glad someone gets it.
No.
If these people don't want us down here, they should just tell us to our face.
I haven't seen you in three days.
I guarantee on my life that this project will end in success!
By the way, Master Ko...
He wouldn't have tried to bury his son's home in concrete in the first place.
Can't we eliminate this man from our reports somehow?
One more, please!
I'm afraid not.
We all have a place in our hearts we long to return to.
Where we were born. Where we hold special memories.
Nino! I've returned!
Welcome back, Rec!
So anyway, Rec... what's the deal? Do we get to stay here or not?
Knowing that makes me a little nervous about showing him my plan.
I do not approve!
No, my company doesn't handle that kind of stuff.
But-
We actually sent a few guys down there yesterday to check out the area.
I could hardly bear listening to the report.
Yeah, why?
Tadaaa!

Doesn't it sound fun?
I though you'd be shuddering in your room.
Okay? So just calm down a little and...
You're so useless, Ric.
Yeah, I was!

Calm down, sis!
It's great to be honest about your feelings in front of someone that you love.

No, it's my fault.
Come to think of it, there's no way Nino-san would have an extra futon.
Then it's a lie!
Yes. It really is great.
But, it's good to hear that my lifesaver didn't have to endure the freezing night.
Yeah, I'm sure it has been used for many years already.
Ah, that's supposed to be...
Well then...
Nino-san, good ni-
Well, normal temperature is fine.
Could it be... that I've done something really stupid?
Nino-san is also a problem. She's a walking entity of pure mystery.

I see.
Which is it?

Bibano. Away, wash. I'm sure it's not english..
Nino-san isn't someone who'll be bothered by this.
I don't really care about this, but...
Yeah. It's fine even if it's just once.
From now on, you have to live alone.

I was the one who requested Sister to bring you here.
Well, I'm here to determine whether or not you're speaking the truth.
Anyway, with this, preparations are a-okay.
You sure you don't need me to prove if I see through lies?
It's fine.
Nino is not your plaything, you bastard!
Okay, that's enough.

Finally...
But I didn't think she'd be that happy.
You actually intend to abandon me and go home like that?!
That's not it!
Will you come along with me, Nino-san?
 Come to think about it, the forces of attraction... are similar to the forces of gravity.
What's the important point?!
Riku...
I wonder if this river really leads to the ocean.
Would you mind wearing it, if it's okay with you?
Huh? Or rather...
Nino-san, wait, why don't...
Huh?
That's already perfect.
I suddenly took a little interest in Nino-san's past.

Yes, that's right.
Initially I thought it would be hard for you to wear it...
I'm curious about your past.
Why?
I, no matter now or the past, am still a Venusian.
Umm, it's not that...
The reason behind that expression, as well as Nino-san's past...
You dummy! Get up quickly! The currents here are really strong...
It only needed a little push to move.
Nope, it must be the sunset.

Nope, not rice.
I'm telling the truth.
Sorry, but could you accompany me to get some stuff?
I might need help carrying something heavy.
Can I carry stuff that even Sister can't carry?
There?
I've had enough new encounters!
Oh, Sister.
Maria...
I finally have the chance to tease a cute child.
Sister, I'm really afraid of this woman.
Sorry.
She knows how to be concerned about other people?
We're off.
How cute!
Riku, I'm sorry but could you go back first?
According to what Sister said, it's somewhere around here that I can get vegetables.
Don't act dumb!
That's overly slippery already!
Nino-san, listen to me. This girl...
Everyone? So this vegetable farm is really hers?
But, oh well...
Uh, how am I going to comfort her?
If-If it's P-Paprika...
If it's Paprika, it should be fine.
Just like the tomatoes that Nino loves to eat...
When I think about her smile, I do my best to cultivate them.

Okay!
I'm sorry, Riku-kun. I was too concentrated on eating.
I do nothing else but draw white lines every day.
I'm the same as Riku-kun.
Well, I already felt that we have the same wavelength.
Eh? Why?!
A gigolo.

Also, I don't want to deal with kids.
It's really cold! It won't do if this goes on.
So, we'll recover once we drink this?
While they advised me to become a teacher...

About what we talked about earlier... I've decided to become a teacher.
I'll instill common sense into these two brothers.

No, that's married couples!
I guess.
Oh well.
My villa is right this way.
Anything special about him?
I'm one of the chosen ones. But of course I wouldn't judge someone by the color of their skin.
You're green! You're a green greeny!
It's no wonder I surprised you.
Whatever.
You're Nino? That's what this guy in a rubber suit calls you? i think he says 'you!' in the background
Don't... Don't you resent it?
I won't object no matter what it is!
Excellent. Looks like you're ready to live here.
That's it. Your name...
Wait, if you're here...
You're supposed to let people finish their sentences.
What's it like living under a bridge?
It's so warm and fuzzy.
Then it must be a lie!
Sure.
We're in the middle of our first date.
Our first date was, by Nino's request, a trip to see the mouth of the Arakawa.
How thoughtless of me. I was so relieved she accepted that I lost focus completely...
Oh, really?
Man, that's great.
Aren't we just back to where we started?
I don't like being held like a princess, Recruit...
Yeah. Why don't we take a rest here?
Hey, now that I think of it, Nino.
The dress I gave you before must have been pretty tough to put on alone.
Why she makes that face, what her past was like...
You're not in pain or anything?
bord5Everyone!
Yeah!
Looks like I have to introduce her.
I think I have a lot to learn from their decisiveness.
She doesn't have a relative in the world, does she!?
All right, Stella! Let's play!
She's so happy... Was she alone after Sister left England?
All right, Stella! Time for our one-on-one!
Only go up to 3-hit combos on normal people!
What are you doing, Ric?
Yeah!
A fairy with a Hiroshima accent?
Watching children playing together truly does warm the heart.
Huh, maybe she really is a good girl.
Oh, Sister!
That's okay, you don't have to say anything.
It's like my existence was just fundamentally rejected...
Anyway, Maria.
Why did you have to glare at me like that?
but if she talked about you like that you'd hate it too!
That habit must be hot.
Pedo.
Old hag.
I'm showing my regret.
As you dreamers show your tickets, a VIP detective wishes you "t'athas"

First, we are born in the same galaxy.
The meetings between humans are so unlikely as to be miraculous.
So, which one of us is more charming to Nino, you or me?
I love you!
Thank you! And I'll make you so happy!
All right, go ahead, Maestro Ric. ugh this shit again
How kind.
Was that a scream?
I win.
I think you should give up on Nino.
How pitiful...
Star's new song "The Howling of a Loser" became popular on the riverbank half a year later.
You wouldn't be able to think of a thing, dad!
No way! Why are you telling us that, Leechbro?
If we let go, we'll drown!
In this world, there are things you have to explain with words!
Really?
No way! The guys from the lab will find out that we're here!
Plus, we already knew how to swim without them on!
The problem is that we can't anymore! this iss wrong hurr
We're really floating!
Ric.
Work is tougher! It takes a lot more effort!
I'm looking forward to it!
If you don't mind sharing, we can get you right in.
That sounds kind of shady.
Made by me.
It smelled like polypropylene or something to me.
Him too?
Does this mean that leeches don't catch colds?
That's no good either.
But your teaching style is really easy to follow.
This should do it in one dose!
Really? Do your best.
It feels like I'm overlooking something important with this plan...

but a constant motion of the heart.
What's that? Do we have to learn them?
And dates! Dates are a matter of distance!
If you want to know why you need to start with rules and manners...
I'm not even sure how I'd physically do that.
What are you here for, then?
Perfect, huh?
I wanted to start with common sense, but maybe it's time to meet them halfway.
There we go!
Not at all!
Let's study science!
Ric...
It isn't really designed for passengers, and it can't make it all the way to Venus.
That's a parachute you attach to the rocket.
If it somehow manages to make it to Venus, this way they won't be offended.
It's common sense. When you set up shop on someone's turf,
Wow, that's complicated!
Stella, you're great!
What's your problem?
I see.
I'll be fine. It's my own garden, so I shouldn't just rely on other people.
Why don't you ask Sister?
As soon as something went flying, Sister would return fire by reflex!
Once I have my license, I'll be able to take a car and go looking for seedlings far away.
She mustn't be allowed a license to kill.
The neighbors will yell "I guess she just didn't see them!" this has to be a refernce, but fuck it editors note: probably yell?
What?
Sorry, I'm old enough that I can only imagine a car as an iron boar. iron horse for lolcalization?
How about taking that suit off?
They'll be surprised, then, won't they?

We had been assigned to write an essay about our dreams for the future.
Episode 62 "Lie"
So you want us to pretend to be employees so it really looks like you've started a business.
How do you plan on getting them to buy that?
You don't ask people to do things all that often.
Do you really think I went along with this for just one suit?
How rude.
When we met with him yesterday, I was amazed that he'd set up a business in a place like this.
That one made me sweat.
Oh, what a nice suit!
Next! Next!
Of course it is!
If you're that dissatisfied with him, perhaps you'd consider transferring him to the main office?
Episode 64 "Secretary"
Yeah!
Play along, okay?
Sorry, Takai!
Ko, why do you have someone like this
Come on, just pretend you're my secretary until he goes away!
Mr. Takai?
It's not like that, Takai!
Episode 65 "A deep relationship"
Oh no, Ko! hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
It's more than that, Nino.
What are you doing, just coming out and saying that in front of Nino!?
Ko is a genius in the business world,
What, Star!?
If you two were really lovers, you'd be trying to make out all the time!
Why do I have to kiss her in front of you guys?
From now on, you can live for yourself.
Put simply, you're making a funny face.
Ms. Niino.
I thought I could become like a father to him.
I...
Just from a kiss?
And it brings a smile to your face.
I can be a bird!
That's too bad, Ric.
We're going to continue secret observation.
Good work, Shimazaki.
I didn't know how far he'd fallen, but...
The other secretary. Takai, was it? What's he doing now?

Looks like a pickled radish.
You know, I've been wondering for a while. Where does Whitey live?in the suburbs, duh.

Even though she's so little, she likes him so much that she came all the way from England looking for him.
To commune with Maria.
Sister!
Oh? Take care!
Jesus's mommy!
No! No, you haven't!
Yeah, that's it!
Sister's hot for the Maria that runs the farm.
He's completely fallen for her!
How'd you get that big anyway!?
The power of "love" is strong.
Shall we go forth?
Our target is Maria! The head of Maria!
Her head!
I was bluffing, but I'm really scared...
My legs are shaking so hard I can't move, so I'll be watching from over here!
Give me your head.
I can't talk with her unless I'm prepared to see the Star of Death.
For someone as weak as me, the only thing left...
This was the worst thing that could have happened. The birth of Team Terrible.

Not to make it a beautiful gem someday.
Sunning myself in the early summer breeze feels so pleasant.
Wait, is something burning?
Don't worry, I cut the grass around it.
Don't panic, Recruit!
What!? You're here, Mayor!?
Thanks a ton, Sister!
Why's sister only respectful to the Mayor?
He doesn't seem all that strong.
Wow, it's really damn hot this year...
Wow, everyone's showing up.
Okay!
I know you said you owed him before, but do you really owe him that much?
The Mayor is a man so valuable that he deserves to be revered.
And I love him more than anyone else under this bridge.
Mayor!?

That's useless! You're all being fooled, anyway!
We'll discuss this further.
He looks like such a fool now.
We're surveying the riverbank.
No, not nukes.
I don't know what he's planning, but whatever he decides to do, he makes sure happens!

Just our being here is against the law!
Don't worry, Recruit.
You really are a great guy, Ric.
Sealed away by the sorcery of kappa barrier. oh god. under the bridge is gensokyo.
I came to ask you to leave this riverbank.
You never truly understand that speed until it's used against you.
Someone from the MLIT came to tell us to leave?
Yes.
If you have enough spare time for this, you'd be better off using it laying more white lines!
Why don't you spit it out, paper-shuffler.
Now, now. That's not how'the appropriate posture' you ask a favor from someone.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm such an undisciplined pig!
Hey, you there. Are they really going to build here?
What do we do, Mayor?
I don't want to be chased or pulled away scattered any more!
How about it? Come on!

I can get better acoustics this way.
In that case, I'm gonna wring a better performance out of you!

In mere hours, she's absorbed two Three-Star Ultima Uniforms.
Compared to the Ryuuko you fought, this one's on a whole different level.
She did it, she did it, she did it!i wonder if this is how they translate ned flanders in japanese
Oh, how fascinating.
Oh, so girls get a free pass!

Hup!
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

You're so narrow-minded.
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin, you know.
That is to say, the more you hate someone, the more you can love them in turn.
Play?
So you caught wind of my research and came here.
That ability shows that it's fitted with Life Fibers too.
I bet it feels out of this world!
Wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?
Put on some clothes.
I'm counting on you.
Wait, Ryuuko!
Sis, show us somewhere we can sneak in.
That's what Life Fiber's gotta be like!
Great job, Tsumugu.
Another trap?
Get back, Tsumugu.
Ryuuko! Ryuuko! Ryuuko! Ryuuko!
But you're just a monster right now!
I will bring you back!yesss
Calm down!
You nearly died of blood loss, you know?
Thanks, Tsumugu.
I couldn't make a single move on those three women.
In the state they're in, they're like monsters that have transcended humanity.
Okay, okay.
I understand!
If you must resent someone, resent me.

I doubt you've recovered fully from that rampage the other day.

That is why you wander aimlessly through life, bereft of ambition!
Is this your ambition? A necessary sacrifice?

She has also decided to pay a visit to Honnouji Academy.
No, you really did get angry on my behalf, Ryuuko.

One way or another, I have to settle this fight with Kiryuuin.
It would seem that even anti-establishment organizations
That's fine. It's just as we planned.just like a plan

She masterfully conquered the teen demographic, which has the highest resistance to Life Fibers.
Still, that is but empty rhetoric.

But why hasn't there been any media attention or public uproar
The Life Fibers woven into them are manipulating the minds of their wearers
and devouring any unnecessary information from their brains.

I can't tell one way or the other.
Even if we can't talk to each other, we understand how you feel.

No, but it did give me the chance to close in on you.
I'm going to pull you out from Junketsu!
Our job as the Kiryuuin family was to protect it until then.

Life Fiber Synchronization, Godrobe Senketsu!
Oh wait, you were talking to Senketsu, right?
Your uniform, however, will receive no mercy!
I'll be back... to strip you tomorrow.
"I hate interruptions."
"Thwart the ambitions of the Kiryuuins by using the Godrobes."
That was Dr. Matoi's goal,
You're interfering with our mission.
"People and clothing are not enemies."
Guts is gonna eat all your food again!
Don't drool on me! Don't fart on me!
His data matches the Anti-Uniform Guerilla we've had trouble with before.
Life Fiber Synchronize, Godrobe Senketsu!
An attack like that isn't gonna work on me!
This is an opportunity to watch a pro at work.
She was a fool.
She's always whispering to it.
Pretty creepy, huh?
You have to take better care of your friend!
Buh-bye!
You want to go through all that suffering again?
I won't let you escape!
Senketsu!
I'm here.
That isn't enough.
Let me tell you two useful pieces of information.
Don't give me that! What the hell is going on?
After clashing in battle with him, you and Senketsu have become true partners!
What was my dad researching?!

she personally vetoed the suggestion.
Wow! There's something out there that not even Inumuta, Intelligence and Tactics Officer, can believe?
Ah, I see.
Have you forgotten that Lady Satsuki ordered us Four Devas to simply stand by and watch?
Did you think you'd managed to get behind me, Sanageyama?
Nicely blocked.
Not at all, milady, though I do find it a shame. That was your favorite cup.
This is Satsuki.
Life Fiber Synchronize, Godrobe Senketsu!
As long as I have these eyes, I can anticipate any move my opponent makes!
Gosh, Mr. Wild Monkey has learned some new tricks, hasn't he?
I didn't hear it that way at all.
God-Speed Thousand Thrusts!
T-They won't come off!
It feels like all the wrinkles in my body are melting away as my Life Fibers line up one by one.
True.
How was your mother's disposition?
Observe what happens when you force a man to change.planescape torment???
His eyes are shut!
Thanks.
We had an agreement.
Your croquettes are as awesome as ever, Mom!
Oh, I'm already full.
Mom died when I was little,
So I never had any family meals before.

Thread Stripper!
A Knife Throwing Club, a Nanjing Lily Club, and a Tightrope Walking club?
they all founded new clubs and are gunning for you.
Say hello to Fight Club President, the great Matoi Ryuuko!
Moron!
Lady Satsuki has spoken.
the club's achievements will be recognized,
and your reputation will skyrocket!
It'll also improve our living situation, right?
We finally have a condo, honey.
It's delicious! It's so delicious!
Thank you, Mako and Ryuuko!
You're up against the Ping Pong Club President, Fuguhara Aizenbou!
I hereby propose that the Fight Club's standard of living be raised!
Oh, you're going out, dear?
Oh, I see.
I am the Fight Club President, Mankanshoku Mako!
Is this really victory?
Two-Star Ultima Uniform!
Ryuuko!
I can't! Not now that we're finally living in luxury!
Mr. and Mrs. Mankanshoku!
Attagirl, Mako!
You never attacked me all-out.
With pleasure!
Finishing Move: Thread Stripper!
We're really sorry!
an8We're so very, very sorry!
Yeah, this is how this family should be!
What did you just say?
a sudden death runoff election will be held with the survivors who arrive in this schoolyard!
And I will grant you your Ultima Uniforms anew!

She has ruled absolutely here, so by sequestering herself,
If something needs to be done, she doesn't hold back.
an8I don't think any of us are dumb enough not to make it to the Sudden Death Runoff Election.
Gosh, things sure are crazy in town, huh?
What's with you guys looking all philosophical?
Oh, what the hell.
In fact, I'm happy 'cause it's like a one-week vacation!
Oh, it was?
My mom died right after I was born,
If you want to live a peaceful life, just stand up and walk away.
I can't believe the gas gauge was busted.
Say, Ryuuko.
This seat is so soft!
an8We'll all go to Hell together!
If you spin the steering wheel like a maniac, you're obviously gonna spin out!
I would ask no one else to!
We are certainly human.
You can play at being righteous all you want,
If I live, my dad's job is history!
What's this crap you're spouting?
If you don't believe me, look at this.
Who do you think you are?! Guys! Make her suffer!
First Year Class A, Kiryuuin Satsuki!
As of this moment, I rule over every student in this junior high school.
Gamagoori.
That was how I first met Lady Satsuki!
A secondary transformation, eh?this isn't even my final form!
Fellow comrades of Honnouji Academy!
You have done well to struggle through seven days of mortal combat
Each and every battle over the last seven days has been recorded!
If we're going to fight her anyway, this grand stage is just the place for it.
Say what?!
What's the holdup?! Get to it already!
That is what discipline is about!
blur1And sprint toward my goal
blur1original na ashita ni naru
Huh?
You bastard! What did you do to Mako?!
She'll just be out for a little bit, so don't worry.
And then I'll wring the truth out of her.
Were you thinking about something?
Let's do it!
You really are a fool, aren't ya?
Come again?
Finishing Move: Thread Stripper!
Surprised? My Shackle Regalia's surface is cloth armor,
Impressive. That Godrobe is far more potent than any other Ultima Uniform.
The Disciplinary Bureau Chairman's forehead is more wrinkled than usual.
If you intend to rule this school with force,
What are you planning?
I will fight against everything this world stands for
Yeah. I'm in rough shape, though.
What's bad around here is your luck.
All right, Matoi Ryuuko, it's time to mold you into shape!
I won't give up!
But she doesn't have a hope of winning like that.
I'll choke the life from you here and now!
Uh-oh. Is it all over?
Just like you planned, Senketsu!
If an Ultima Uniform can transform,
Meticulously observe where one's feelings are headed!
No mercy? Dude, seriously?
A girl?
What?
If I was allowed to be her second, I'd be right there looking after her!
How amusing!
Inumuta, win!
You can do it!
I know your type.
It's the same general principle as the Ultima Uniforms,
When Inumuta Houka's Ultima Uniform shines,
He did not vanish!
If all I can gather is obvious data like this,
That's what happens when you rely on your eyes.
All I want is data.
Jakuzure. Prepare for battle.
She certainly knows how to make a cheery entrance.
Three-Star Ultima Uniform: Symphony Regalia Grave!
It's so loud I can barely think.
Symphony Regalia Presto!
Actually, I guess my view is even higher right now.
Goodness, it seems like you have time to complain, at least.
Like I said, on what planet is that a uniform?!
flimsy ropes of yours!
Every part of Senketsu's body is a bundle of Life Fibers!
You think you can cut him that easily?
I think I could get used to this Naturals Election thing.

Now, now, why are you losing your cool,
Whew, that was a close call. I almost made Gamagoori angry.
Where are you going, Ryuuko?
I'm going to erase you!
Ow!
The sound on that thing!
The rhythm blasted out by my Ultima Uniform
It's bad manners to talk during a performance!
Matoi is taking the rhythm emanated by Jakuzure
She's altering the frequency of the waves Jakuzure is giving off to match her own.
Let's do it!
Sword Scissor: Decapitation Mode!
Finishing Move: Thread Stripper!
How adorable!
Is Matoi that strong?
Sanageyama! Get back!
You lousy skinflint!
Who the hell is that?
Why have you come here, Harime Nui?
Sorry I'm late, Hououmaru.
How ill-natured of you, ma'am.
You're as breathtaking as ever!
Stand aside, woman.
Who the hell is that girl?!
Yes, overwhelmingly so.
You're no fun at all.
Go right back to being a naked ape!
It's the red thread of fate!
Kiryuuin Ragyou.
Oh, man.
Kiryuuin Satsuki, if I have to go through her to get to you, I don't care who she is.
Who else could it be?
I don't wear such crude things.
Ta-dah!
Guts! Guts!i don't think we subbed guts before... though i'm also not sure if he said anything before

Wow, it's silky-smooth!
You can tell it's 100 genuine Life Fiber.
My ass, you can!
Is that the Nexus Thread?
That's right.
Yup.
A shape-memorizing lab coat, huh?
If this keeps up, I won't be able to control myself!
Things are getting fun!
Wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?
I'll stop her.
I'm counting on you.
Back-alley doctor Mankanshoku,
That's what Life Fiber's gotta be like!
It was a trap?
But there's no guarantee that the person wearing the outfit will survive.use this, and you can't guarantee that they'll live
Forgive me, Ryuuko.
She noticed me?senpai noticed me
Why, if it isn't Lady Satsuki.
That side of yours isn't cute at all, Lady Satsuki.is totally uncuteunsweet
Nothing good ever happens to things you find cute.
Gotcha.
Stop!
Huh?
I will bring you back!yesss
Ryuuko!
Did she die?!
I couldn't make a single move on those three women.
Harime Nui.
I will show you no mercy, Grand Couturier or not.
Exactly.
I know the answers to all of those questions.
Culture club squads one through eighteen, preparations complete.
Anti-Kyoto, and Anti-Kobe Combat-spec Ultima Uniforms are complete.
A woman's heart is a fickle thing.
It's not like being asked if you want to go somewhere makes you want to go,
but after she came back, she was all mopey for some reason.
You're Mankanshoku Mako, aren't you?
Matarou and the others had some earlier.
I think those might be a bit dangerous.
Nagita says he's gotten on the Student Council's bad side
and has been barred from the school grounds ever since!
When Man ate the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,
What is clothing?
A rather powerful article of clothing, is it not?
Hououmaru.
Godrobe Senketsu, eh?
You understand perfectly.
I've sent the data to HQ as well.
It bums me out that we might have to take on that monstrous girl, though.
Yeah, she and the sailor uniform were staring each other down again today.
Don't you think that's wrong?!
Go on, Mankanshoku! Hand out those newspapers!
an8Thank you! Thank you! Read our paper! Thank you! Read all about it!
Oh, no! Run, Mankanshoku!
Nagita! Don't be an hero! Run! Run!
Our straw mats!
an8S-Stop it!
Everyone has to start somewhere!
Senketsu, if I go too far, I'll need you to stop me.
With your own willpower.
That is why I am not frightened in the least.
So you've finally gotten dressed, Ryuuko.
Fear from when you lost control.
You're so predictable that it's downright adorable!
No! You can't be!
Harime Nui! It was you all along?
What's got you all frowny?
Find suitable hosts, and divide the scraps among them.
We're going, Soroi.
Yes, milady.

That's the Osaka-style okonomiyaki that you eat with a spatula instead of chopsticks,there are other kinds of okonomiyaki???

So how are you gonna deal with all these people, huh?
Huh?
Purge her!
What is it?
How do you intend to fight an opponent like Satsuki?
Cash-crazy Osaka!
That damn Kiryuuin always does whatever the hell she wants.
If you think everyone you meet's just gonna do what you say, you're sorely mistaken.
All's fair in love, war, and splashin' out the cash!
If we don't throw this money around, who will?!
It looks like you've become obsessed with the power of those strange outfits lately,
Regardless of the era, it's money that motivates folk!
What was that? Some kind of bluff?
I'm about to rise higher than ever before!
That's my foolproof strategy for winning!
Yes. I can sense it in the very air the stench of your overblown arrogance.ogori  arrogance
don't add up to jack!
Your precious Ultima Uniforms ain't no thing against the full might of the Takarada Conglomerate!
They'll take 'em off your hands for cheap!
I will not allow so much as a scratch on Lady Satsuki!
Catch, Sanageyama!
Head! Body! Wrist!
You ain't movin' any more!
It's baked crab paste for you!
Did you think your crab paste could coat me?!
Mankanshoku?OTP
powerful bio-energy flows through its Life Fibers.
It would appear that you cannot synchronize without this glove.i thought it was a tekko!
We were worried that you'd never show and our new Ultima Uniforms would go to waste.
Do you think a group with a foolish name like Nudist Beach can thwart our grand design?probably
Shackle Regalia Mk 2!
I'm not scared anymore, either.
What?
Nevertheless, you still cannot beat me!
It has! Don't underestimate Matoi Ryuuko when she's concentrating on a goal that's almost within reach!
Senketsu and I will stop you!
How impertinent!
Impossible!
All the blood I had sucked up was collected in the blade.
We are returning to Honnouji Academy!
Kiryuuin.
What the?!
The same tactic will not work twice!
saaNow, here's something that I'm sure you've all been expecting for quite some time.
Screw you, Ms. Bigmouth Eyebrows!
Milady!
Your fights seem to be taking a greater toll on your body than before.
The Grand Couturier? When did you get here?!
I go wherever I want to go,
You must all remain vigilant until you reach Honnouji Academy.
Ryuuko, I'm amazed you fought Kiryuuin Satsuki to a draw.
There is no reason to keep secrets any longer.
I never knew you were an exhibitionist!
Woo!
What?
Take off Junketsu, please.
Mother.
Now, Ryuuko,
The moment this shining ball of thread that had wandered across space touched down on Earth,
That is COVERS.
the Life Fibers left us with only the habit of clothing ourselves
and entered a long period of dormancy.silence
Hope?
That's right.
Godrobe Senketsu was created by Dr. Matoi to fight against the Life Fibers.
but if they ever were to awaken,
You mean to say Senketsu's just a weapon?
I can't fight while wearing you!
She was pleased with our results.
She has also decided to pay a visit to Honnouji Academy.
I'll be counting on you four.
I was just thinking I needed to settle things with you.
After all, the reason you wear Senketsu is because you love him the most, right?
You'd never be able to wear a piece of living clothing otherwise. That'd just be icky!
I don't feel like shooting them anymore.
Even looking at this, it beggars belief to be told that Life Fibers are lifeforms from outer space.
That's the kind of person you are.
so they needed to create Life Fibers that would obey a human's will.
What?!
Ah, yes.
I suppose it was on that day that all this really began.
What a well-mannered family. Even the dog introduces itself.
I heard that Mako was conscripted for the Battlefield Trip.
The other students have returned, but not Mako or Ryuuko.
I will grant you a special pardon!OTP
Firstly: are the girls alive?
she plans to offer up every last person gathered at Honnou Town
Ryuuko?
This will be interesting.
There are some who are best tricked into taking them for themselves.
The next step to the awakening of COVERS.
Only that which earns Kiryuuin Ragyou's approval may be called beautiful.beauty lies only in the eyes of kiryuuin ragyou, obv
I expect you to dress up for the occasion.
They're capable of cutting Life Fibers.
I've asked our remaining members to look after her here.
Straighten out those lights a little!
I appreciate all your hard work.
What is the world?
Dad! Mom! Guts, too?!
I see. And that is Godrobe Senketsu?
I swear, you Kiryuuins sure love to talk down to people!
No, I'm not!
People do not live for the sake of clothing!
Honnouji Academy is the fortress I created in order to defeat you!
Huh?
Impertinent high schoolers!
Matoi.
Did you just call your own mother a monster?
I don't think someone who can shrug off a stab through the heart has any right to disagree.
I am no monster, young lady.
Do you really think you can beat me just by getting a little facelift?
Let's have you stay put, shall we?
So you were alive, my daughter?
Yep!
You know where it's at.
Ladies and gentlemen!
What did you say?
to rebel against the Life Fibers and Kiryuuin Ragyou.
Those are the COVERS, huh?
All hands, fire the instantaneous coagulants!
I sewed my Marionette Thread throughout their brains.
But if that's the case,
Mon Mignon Prt--Porter!
You guys are too serious. Such a bore!
so take this opportunity to learn how to have a little fun, 'kay?
We've never been in such good shape.
Great causes are always fuelled by personal desire!
you can't possibly survive!
Is it just my imagination?
Satsuki.
I applaud your efforts.
Ultimately, Satsuki was never fit to wear Life Fibers.
daughter of mine!you're the daughter of mine that was supposed to have died
With all three heroines absent, the show has hit its biggest crisis.
The naked warriors are still here.
Very few humans are merged this perfectly with Life Fibers.
Calm yourself, Ryuuko!
when their backs are against the wall!
This means that all academies that were under Honnouji Academy's control
Both were reforged from Lady Satsuki's shattered Bakuzan.
Whatever.
I think you could have at least considered the option of joining forces with Nudist Beach.
Clothing made by Kiryuuin Ragyou's REVOCS Inc. has spread through the entire population.
"They have eyes but fail to see and ears but fail to hear", huh?
She feigns obedience to Ragyou,
I'm so sorry that we can't communicate with you, Senketsu.
After all, she's been through a lot.
have all been assimilated by COVERS.
Souichirou faked his own death and entrusted his revenge to you.
Ignorant of all this, you earnestly believed everything he had said and plotted your rebellion against me.
I put two and two together.
Satsuki's gonna get eaten by it. By my masterpiece.
Well, let's get going, Monkey.
This is the Super Suction Saver!
In Heaven's stead, I smite clothing!
We'll talk later.
I'm stuck!
At all!
This isn't like you at all!
OP
Honnouji Academy shall be the stage where you and I, mother and daughter, settle things once and for all!
Adieu, mon amie!
Wait, Ryuuko!
Barging in in a fit of rage would put you in too much danger.
Quit acting like you're my goddamn teacher!chalk pusher, clearly
Deep down, I bet you were laughing at this freak of a girl!
Step aside!
See that? That's who I am right now.CRRAAWWWLLINNGG INN MMYYYY SKIIIINNN
We can't count on Matoi Ryuuko to fight for us anymore.
For high schoolers, you guys sure have good heads on your shoulders.
I finally managed to infiltrate the academy's system.
How cruel.
Nails, to be more precise.
Sheesh. How roundabout can she be?
Open the Doutonbori Gate!
Mako!
I got a lotta money ridin' on that thing!
part b
I've come, just as I said I would!
Wow, so fast!
but you were being kept alive by the same Life Fibers you considered your enemy.
In that case, who exactly are your allies?
Just kidding!
Yup.
But you can't go against the threads of fate!
When did these threads get here?
I have no means to stop them right now.
Stop!
You understand, don't you, Ryuuko?
it wouldn't be safe to stick around in this area.
Soon, we'll have to face our worst possible enemy.
Tsumugu!
What?!
How could Ryuuko wear another Godrobe?than me
Die.this is like, "die, mohawk guy riding a mech that exposes blahblah as usual"
I'm so envious of you.
Which is why I chose to become the Grand Couturier.
You should be able to understand how I feel now.
Life Fiber Override:
Don't go all "older sis" on me now.
Let's back Lady Satsuki up!
Wait!
That is what these two blades symbolize!
That should do it for today.
"Ingenuity", my ass.
It's completely and utterly shameful.
Sounds like your kind of phrase, eh,
What is wrong with you?!
You can't, can you?
That's why your teamwork's all wonky.linkingconnecting moves etc
And yes, this Life Fiber Synchronize is but a stopgap measure.
So what?
It won't fall apart that easily!
You're just a human. Spare me.or whatever, but needs to be this short
She sewed the Godrobe onto her body?!
Our job as the Kiryuuin family was to protect it until then.
This world shall belong to the Life Fibers.
May we?
Be that as it may, the blade within my heart still stands firm.
You're the reason I believe there's still a chance to turn this around.
If Matoi Ryuuko is indeed completely on your side,
Kill that girl along with Senketsu!
So you're going to protect that girl?
Now, Mankanshoku!
How can you call this happiness?
You stupid, foolish, fool!
Life Fiber Synchronize!
I'm never gonna take Senketsu off again.
These incomprehensible goofballs are always giving everything they have to save me!
are finally back where they belong!
They can prevent the restoration of Life Fibers?
I haven't lost yet!
I'll show you that I can take that fist of yours.
No, we're genuinely pissed off!we're not snapping "back" at you; we're just seriously ticked off
Our faces belong to Lady Satsuki.
You're utterly incomprehensible!
From the moment you showed up dressed in Senketsu,
I tested both Senketsu's strength and your own.
If you could stay in control of yourself without letting your Godrobe consume you,if you could keep your will
But I was sorely mistaken.
was me.
But now I know that the world is not a piece of cloth.
and that's what makes it beautiful.
Man, even your apologies are overblown.
Please wash down your meal with some tea.
I'm talking about what Satsuki said.
Did I perhaps sew the Marionette Threads all wrong?
You're ignoring me?!
Life Fibers are a lifeform that wander across space.
and then turn the planet itself into an energy source by causing it to explode,
Oh, man. He did it again.
I've managed to hack into REVOCS' communications satellite.
Your blood's flowing through Junketsu right now.
Junketsu Whirlwind!
Mankanshoku showed the greatest increase in parameters compared to her base state.
Iori, I think you set a new personal speed record on that one.
Yeah. This will be the last set of Ultima Uniforms I ever make,
What are you dawdling for?
OP
Since when did you get into the whole positive reinforcement thing?
This sword is an ultra-hard Life Fiber.
Stand back!
Leave it to us! There!
That's too many bandages, dear. Mako can't move now.
that this ship was her whole world!
Your opinion is invalid!
Blade Regalia:
Snake!
No matter how much theyyou? resist, humans are meant to submit to Life Fibers.
Your last bastion is almost within reach!
Ridiculous.
and then take out the original Life Fiber.
My arm is every bit as hard as Bakuzan.
just look at how much li'l Nonon has grown!lol her shift in tone and expression is amazing
Hey, what's the big idea?
Sounds good!
Turbines One and Three are out of commission!
Is this really all humanity can do?
You looked down on imitations, but they've proved to be your downfall.
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Lady Ragyou.
Omnisilk Kouketsu is ready.
Forgive me.
but Kiryuuin Ragyou's still alive and kicking.
And now we're going to barge into Honnouji Academy, destroy the transmitter,
and capture both Ragyou and Harime Nui!
Don't smash the cups.
We already put the original Life Fiber six feet under,
so quit trying to fight back.
Behold!
It's a super high-speed jammer!
Here are the pictures our communications satellite took from all over the world.
Wonderful.
Don't forget about us!
The original Life Fiber will consume you all and return in its full glory.
You can move even under the influence of Absolute Domination? You're impressively strong.
Ugly, ugly, ugly!
You may have rendered Godrobes powerless,
Lady Ragyou.
That I'd been given the same powers as Ryuuko!
You guys take care of the transmitter.
Unrestrained Ego Blast!or something
Yes.
But that's an activation signal.
Return to your original form,
Let's dress up in cute clothes,
put on some cute accessories,
A world like that!
Gotcha.
Beautiful.
But it's too late.
No way!
Pull yourself together, Ryuuko!
I can still fight!
Take a look, Ryuuko.
All creations will ultimately perish.
The actions of the Life Fibers are merely in accordance with that principle.
You're my daughter!
I wasn't raised by you!
I should cast it aside!and become a disney villain
Did you forget already?
Sure did.
I thought of it as my mother's tough love, and I took it on the chin.
I realized it during the fight with Omnisilk Kouketsu.
The reason I've been absorbing Life Fibers all this time was to hone that ability!
and everything else!
That's just who we are!
Surrender peacefully, and let's go back together.
This is not the end, Ryuuko.
I'm glad I met you.
Ryuuko!
Ryuuko!
What'll happen to the rest of the Life Fibers?
Holy shit!

What's your name?
I heard that, you know.
Get set... Go!
Do you even know what sumo is?
I've seen it a bit before.
All right! Let's give this another try!
Yasuna, Sonya...
Yeah. You look good in it!
Hey, wait.
Eat the rest!
What are you doing?
Sonya-chan, aren't you hot?
Even so, we didn't have to go out of our way to come here.
This is dumb.
I broke it before you.
One day.
So mean!
Eh?
I said I'm fine!
I'll go next.
Like you can be any dumber!
No, maybe this'll have a reverse effect!
I'll teach you something good, so lay off me.
There's all sorts of good effects if you do it properly!
You look like an idiot.
See? Your punch got stronger!
"You'll regret it if you don't come."
why did you have to disguise yourself as Yasuna?
Yes, I'm here to get rid of you too.
You stupid little...
Are you turning your back on me?
I wonder which one was real in the end...
It's you!

Bees can see people too.
To think she can take the form of a bird...
There's a small transmitter that allows me to talk.
Ah! I'm sorry!
You hit my substitution.
Sonya-chan, looks like they're having a festival!
Whatever, I'll just try it again!
Everything but food here is gambling.
I'll just close my eyes and toss it.
Missy, you haven't got it once, so if you can hit it, I'll give it to you.
Really?!
Ah! I don't have anymore money!
Look! Look at how cool I look!
Do you not know how charming this is?!
Let's catch fish with it!
I'd rather not touch them.
Then why did you invite me along?!
If we bark back, it may get scared and run off!
You could've at least tried to bark once.
Wow! What a nice ninja technique.
I have 20 of 'em!
Um, I don't have a swimsuit.
The puppets!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Shut up! Be quiet!
On top of that, your act sucks!
Again!
Here.
You don't have to take them out...
Don't name it that!
Ow...
Oh my, Sonya-chan, what big teeth you have!
This is already turning to crap.
So cute! So cute!
But it'd be suspicious if I had this on me.
I was going to let you be my secretary!

She's not picking up.

I can do dry ice.
Let's try it out so it doesn't go to waste then.
You guys have too much time on your hands.
It was closed for repairs!
So straight!
And why do you want to come so badly, anyway?
You really can't?
Yep!
I said, there's a sign board there.
Well, because it's my house.
Wow!

Are you okay with that, as a member of humanity?
So you don't think you can beat my record!
Are you holding it, Sonya-chan?
Wow! Is there anything else you can tell me?
Sonya-chan, you idiot!
That's a bit frustrating...
Four...
Isn't this something entirely different?
If not a cafe, then how about we go the traditional route with a haunted house?
Why am I with you?
But the cavalry battle has four people per group.
Advance, everyone!
So mean!
You toss this flame scroll right into the enemies.
A battle to see who can take off the other's hat!
Ta-da! Beanbags!
I have to become a pro!
Ahh... I'm amazing.
I was injured by a toy!
Wouldn't it be hard to be good?
That's not it!
If you don't mind an umbrella, there's one over there.
At any rate, a pot is used to boil water!
Oh, you're an idiot, so you don't know.

No, I'm not!

Wh-What do I do, Sonya-chan?
That's it! I'll leave that to you!
Let's try something else first!
The oil's going to catch fire!
It may come off with force!
Maybe after wearing it for a while, it adjusted to the size of your head?
Waaaaait!
We don't even have a band to break apart.
O-Of course.
You're the one who can't play!
Ha! You underestimate me! I can play the flute!
You just need an isntrument you can beat on to refresh yourself.
I win! You fell for it!
Let me test this out.
Don't you know?
Once I hit it in the 100 point zone, we're done.
With you as the target.
Wh-What?
Wh-When did she get my hand...
My head's worth 0 points, so no matter how many times you hit me, it's fine.
But you had your big mouth open.

What are you talking about?
I thought this stick might be able to shoot beams...
She's so obvious...
Huh?
Look at this!
Apparently it's been spotted in the mountain near our school!
I thought you were all excited over it!
I wouldn't do that!
It's a waste of time looking.
They're all just mistaken or lying.
That Sonya-chan, not honest at all.
She's just making more stuff up.
It's just a snake.
Wait!
Wait, don't tell me he's not actually the Tsuchinoko?!

After schooool. After school.
Are you running away without participating in this mandatory event?
Really?
In the palms of Sonya-chan's hands
It's got to be in one of the snowmen!
Move!
Feels so nice...
You're being so annoying I was just wondering if you wouldn't go home already.
The next day. The next day.
You can eat canned peaches now!
Oh, come on.
I'll bet you're at 39C already.
I want a remote controlled toy.
Fine then.
I am a daffodil.
I know, but you were pissing me off.
Want to try too?
No.
That much I can do.
This one's pretty good.
There's no point if it can't fly!
The color has nothing to do with it.
Hm? What's wrong?
Dammit! This was another one of your pranks?!
A Christmas party?
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
There's still a week before Christmas, so I can't just give stuff away for free.
That being the case...
She left.
Good one!
Hi, I'm Oribe Yasuna, and here's the punishment I'm going to do for you.
Wait...
Of Santa, Icicles, and Snowmen

be4blur2If you make it worthwhile, we'll see
be4blur2tanoshii jikan ga ii no kana
Autumn.
Why are you only telling me now?
That was my new year's first dream!
I think I've seen that before.
Though I'm sure this school wouldn't have a mortar or hammer...
Where from?
I'll prepare everything in the clubroom, so drop by later.
Perhaps you're mistaking it for body clone technique?
I love you.
There's no way you're making any with that thing.
Let's see... What can I use?
You mean when people choke on it?
Well that's boring.
Hey, it's Killtaro-san!
Don't underestimate a dog's tracking skills!
Zombie Baby!
I have some items!
After school.
Did we have to make a detour all the way out here?
Well, have fun.
Let's go!
Get it?
You fell!
Seeing a squid in the air is really weird.
Why do I have to...
It looks like someone else now.
Save me! Hurry!
I figured you were trying to drag me down with you.
Of course not.
I'm fine with not going in.
I'm a magical girl who came from the land of magic to train!
...getting beat up in the ring.
You idiot! I ain't doing that!
No way...
Y-You're good.
Use whatever you have to win, even magic!
What're you doing?!
Kill Me Baby!
kougina best friend nagashime de dotsukuna!
What now, Naamin?
be4blur2It's time to confess
be4blur2I shake away my vertigo,
be4blur2A secret
Pyonsuke!!
Sonya-chan!
One morning.
Don't waste those!
Now you'll be fine even if I hit you.
Shouldn't you be the one wearing this, anyway?
I'll do it properly this time, so can I try again?
That was just a little sudden, so it surprised me a bit.
I said I was going!
Don't tell me you forgot to wear it...
Alright...
Why not?
Like Pascal's law or Taylor's theorem,
You don't get it, huh...
You really are hopeless.
A few hours later.
Itchy...
I've been so busy lately I haven't had any time to sleep...
Where is it?
You can't go back today!
I'm sorry! Give! Give!Tap out! Tap out!
Sonya-chan!
Man, I'm sleepy.
I'll buy something else.
In which case...
I was looking out for you!
It's true!
N-No! I don't have any pictures!
What pointless resistance.
Who is that?
None of your business.
Not even by reflex?
If you didn't lose it so easily, it'd be a lot better.
You should only lose knives! Just kidding.
It's not good if you get upset easily.
What? You're one to talk.
How about...
Lunchtime.
I want to be human again...
Let's bring in our new recruit!
I'm actually 02 but since you killed me, I'm 03.
If you want to get to him, you'll have to pass me first!
You really aren't gentle!
Why don't you quit being an assassin and be a chiropractor instead?
What's up? Qu pasa? Qu pasa?

be4blur2A secret
It's pointless to resist...
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!
Huh?
I'll forgive you this once if you undo these right now.
It's made well...
If metal's no good then maybe flesh...
Okay, no one's here.
What are you doing?
Wow! Just like I planned!
Not really.
What's wrong with you?
It's fine! Just think of it as having another birthday!
What is this?
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper!
And you emptied it.
I'll be waiting for your present!
Wanna go eat okonomiyaki right now?
What's with you?
If that's how it's gonna be, I'll just hide your shoes!
Is that where her target is?
That was horrible...
Just stay there.
How could you fall into your own trap?
Oh! It's that dog!
Then you're just going to leave me here.
Sonya-chan!
If that happens, I...
I can't tease you, I can't get hit by you,
I see.
Oh, you have something on you.
Absolutely Naamin
You're always on-site, but that's why it's a slow ride

be4blur2My true feelings are a secret
She's does a special type of work.
It's just that I don't know if I can keep one in a headlock...
so I figured I ought to learn at least something about self-defense.
Stop! That's too harsh, so no dice!
so it's okay.
Please do!
You missed again!
My yakisoba sandwich!
Sheesh.
No! She just evacuated to higher ground!
Don't worry! You can do it!
Fine. If you're going to go that far,
Prepare yourself, dog!
I ran out halfway!
Just kidding.
Eat! Eat!
I've lost my self-confidence.Confidencefaith in myself.
I'll always be your friend!
I've heard rumors about a ghost appearing in a classroom.
Get away from me!
They say it hangs from the ceiling.
Wouldn't that become a problem if there's a fire and the smoke rises up?
Ninja?
I knew it was you.
So, why are you here?
See?
Here.
On another day.
Don't try to call my mistaking someone else for you as one of your techniques!
Okay, so shall we try some shuriken practice?
Wow!
I'll give you this secret set of scrolls that allow you to use any technique with ease.
Why are you bringing out the extreme techniques now?!
Give it to me!
That's the water jutsu!
Oh, it's just a picture.
Just goes to show that you can't trust her techniques.
Why don't you just get a bottle opener if you're going to buy bottled juice?

Confession time now the storm has passed
If you can make it worthwhile, then we'll see
Absolutely Naamin
Always on one side, but that's why it's so right
Kill Me Baby!
It's always all right, but that's why you have to die
Still going! Come on! Come on!
Let's do it! Come on! Come on!
Stand too close friend then
Policy!
Hey, Sonya-chan, teach me some more cool moves!
Anyway, I hope you can teach me well
Don't show them to me!
You're not even being serious.
Keep it a secret.
My legs!
I've seen in manga that you can escape by tickling them.
All right! Bring it on!
Damn it!
So, here you go!
On the subject of nunchucks...
Idiot!
Now, now.
What should I get...?
It's coming towards me for some reason.
It's honey-flavored!
Help me!
Here. This is for you.
No way! How do you not know what a paper fan is?!
N-No, that's not what I meant!
I can't hold my breath for that long.
Get rid of it!
Don't come back again!
Don't worry.
And again, after school.
You should've just dodged it!
Do you want to get it back?
Well, whatever.
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
She's a waste of time.
Catch!
Stop! Don't throw it!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Sure.

As one encounter led to a double romance...
"Night of Summer Side"
"Take me to Summer Side"
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
Look!
Huh?
You saw it, didn't you?!
Dad! I got it!
Let's all have the "Space Experience" together!
Oh, no, let's not!
What?
Just between the two of us?
A UFO?! alphaHFFYeah. There's a rumor going around that someone saw a UFO!
And? You DID take the pictures, didn't you?!
W...Well, no...
W...Well...
Uh-huh. I guess I made a mistake or something...
It's no wonder, she's the "Alien of Homeroom 3-A" to begin with!
Why did you say you saw a UFO, when you know they don't exist!
Don't you care how much your Dad loves this town?!
Oh...
A straw hat, eh...
It's the last day of the first Semester.
Looks like we've done something awful to Madoka, huh?
Well, maybe we should make a ton of UFOs fly around!
Ayukawa!
All right! Let's step on it! Okutama or bust!
UFO, you said? Haven't heard anything about it.
...and if that's what you have to do in order to be an adult...
...then I...
Huh? Yeah...
Let's go!
I'm sorry. I did see the UFO too.
"Take me to Summer Side"
"Fireworks Show!"
1 o'clock, right? No problem! See ya!
It was... an invitation full of temptation...
Well, it's just a little swimming before going to the library, so...
You'll be sorry if you do anything crazy to Hikaru!
Hikaru! Please wait for me!
Oh, no! Th... The time!
I didn't know you were here too, Hikaru!
Darling! I rented a boat. Come on! Let's go!
Let me see... It's gotta be around here.
Wh... Where did you pop up from?!
Er... A... Ayukawa...
You klutz!
Get out, quick.
Your willingness to sacrifice yourself for those you love is truly admirable!
Niiice...
Darling, what's wrong?
Besides, I forgot to tell you this, but...
...I've got to go work at ABCB now. See you later.
Where in the world did Darling go...?
Yeah!
I asked her to come along...
It was me who..."A Love Made of Glass"...made you choose...
"Why is it sad in the summertime?"
At night the sighs softly snow on the city.
What am I doing exactly...?
So, it looks like we're just gonna have to study together again tomorrow.
The fireworks... I guess they're over now, huh?
Hold on a sec, okay?!
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
The expansive blue skies...
Next time: "Madoka's Challenge! The Haunted Beach's Big Wave Legend."
...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe.
"Night of Summer Side"
The white flower petals on your soaking skirt...
Tell me why, when you winked...
"Yeah! Lucky!
"Tell me, Tell me"...my Angel of the Summer...
 "Tell me, Lover, Tell me that you need me."
"And, if that were so... then..."
Oh! I can 't wait any longer!
"Tell me, Lover, Tell me that you need me."
Sheesh! What a womanizing bastard!
Lemme see here...
I told you not to use the Power!
Go to the pool! The pool!
Say, Papa... wouldn't it be nice to have some pictures of the sea...
So, this ghost named Koto is going to appear? On this beach?
...the only remaining surfer.
Why... it's only a bat.
Her skin seemed so sweet, enough to make me faint...
Ayukawa!
You see, my boyfriend died at this beach three years ago.
I was trying to decide what to do.
...I feel like I won't ever be able to get over him and get married.
Thank you.
At any rate... the weight that my body was bearing...
So, she was... a ghost?
Oh, c'mon! You're lying, aren't you!
Hey, would you please!
No way! It's crazy, not even Madoka could...
She was like a completely different person.
"Yeah... I sort of understand it... What she feels, that is."
"It'll be fine."
"...in place of her."
Madoka!
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15 years old...
An encounter is like a highway junction...
Dammit... 1... 2...
Let me row a bit, Kasuga.
"Okay, okay, okay! I shall be with you!"
There! A pose!
I looove to travel by boat!
I mean, you-know-who is with her, after all.
Why, you!
I'm wondering... just how closely we'll follow the script of the movie...
"Oh, Baby, Tell me, Tell me..." You're unpredictable...
What's wrong?!
What did you say?!
As the saying goes, "He who worries trusts not." Right, Hatta?
By now, those two could be...
Still, I wonder if Darling and Madoka are okay?
...I can't summon up enough energy.
Ayukawa!
Power, I hope there's a little of you left in me!
...the first night we worked at ABCB...
...but...
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
The next day, Hikaru vanished deep into the birch forest, as if trying to avoid us.
Once you get into senior high, you'll be beautiful.
Hikaru!
"Where two prefectures meet, a river runs through it."
H... Hey, Hatta! Why, you! Hold it!
...so I hope that you'll comport yourselves beautifully!
Mr. Kitakata!
Get set!
Why, that Kurumi! She used the Power again!
Do you think this isn't me?
Oh! Are you trying to defend him, Madoka?
Please be sure to come and enjoy it!
This isn't good!
What's wrong?
Yeah!
There!
Right then... I, er... felt, on one spot on my back...
Let's try it again.
Darling!
1... 2... 1... 2...
Hikaru...
Kasuga, what're you gonna do?
At that moment... I had completely forgotten about Hikaru.
You sure are popular.
I don't know what to do about it... my heart is never at peace.
Hikaru!
Help!
Oh! Help!
Hikaru!
I'd like to make it up to you.
Actually, I don't care... about a kid like that.
Look at me...
Tell me why, when you winked...
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
'Tell me, lover, Tell me that you need me...
What?
Oh, gosh... it's gone...
What's wrong?
What?!
I was a bit... afraid of her, but...
Wanna head over to that mountain?
Are you scared?
Say, Madoka... Have you seen Darling?!
Is that a raindrop I see...?
...or...
What's the matter?
Weren't you... going to fool around with me?
I... er...
"It d... doesn't matter...?"
an9Kasuga!
an1Darling!
Geez! What a troublemaker!
Darling!
Geez! What exactly is inside your head?!
Yay, yay, yay! Me too!
H... Hi there.
...not a raindrop, after all...
We're only keeping quiet 'cause she told us not to tell, you know.
I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15-years old...
That's what's written on your profile.
Oh, what now? You said you'd hang out with me all day.
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
Tell Me, Tell Me - but you're a mystery.
Oh, that's right.
I said, "maybe," didn't I?
Sure!
Come on now, let's get going. Come on!
You dumb-ass! What the hell are you thinking, man?!
You're gonna rip my ear off!
Oh, c'mon, lemme use it for a sec...
Dammit! Just when it was getting good!
No thanks. I'm gonna go straight home and crash. I'm exhausted, y'know!
Am I?
"Intimate Pub Papillon" "Hotel Candy"
What?!
Hikaru! W...Would you wait a sec?! Listen...
Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, now! Let's get going!
That's right. Did you have an argument with him or something, Madoka?
All right! Why don't we get started here, right, Madoka?
...so did Ayukawa...!
Here's Swingtop's new song!
Yippee!
If a mere whisper is all it takes to turn your love around...
...I'd throw pebbles of words into your heart to hold you tight.
Each time I follow your eyes I find... there awaits someone else.
"Broken Heart to Dream..."
...or a teen-age relationship...
...that's not the issue here.
...to treasure memories of all the little things we experience together.
Shuu and I are cousins, y'know.
So that's it!
...KNOCK ourselves out!
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter... "
You were waiting for the lucky star in your room...
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter... "
Ayukawa and I have been chosen to anchor a relay marathon.
Who thinks it should be Kasuga?
...to tell me that you'd be mine...
Darling, what's wrong?
We'd like to decide who will get to be our sacrificial lambs.
The way he MOVES when he's buying a Cutlet-Sandwich... it's just inhuman!
You idiot! Here!
The way he pursues girls no matter how much he gets dumped... that spunk...
Good idea! Yeah!
If we both get the first place prizes, then everyone's gonna be...
Goody-Goody Two Shoes!
"Mountain."
Right, don't worry about a thing!
This way!
...and rejoin the crowd before anybody notices!
Gee, what a coincidence! We had no idea at all!
Oh! You dimwits!
Sempai!
What are you doing?
Yippee! Darling! You're the best!
"Darling, you see, said he's running for my sake!"
It begins with "Hi-" and ends in "-ru."
O... oww...
Why don't you get some exercise yourselves?!
I got these, y'know!
No, not yet!
There are a lot of people around there, so near the supermarket is out.
How dare you!
Aoki.
Here.
Apparently Kasuga's caught a cold, so he'll be absent.
I wonder... if it's because of what I did...?
I'll go visit him after school!
I'm sorry for being obstinate about...
Huh?
You know, looks like my cold is gone!
Yeah...
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
There was ME, ten years younger... right in front of my eyes!
Pfhhht!
Doesn't he look just like you, Oniichan?
What were you lookin' at?!
N... N... No, no... Nothing really!
Sorry about that.
...watch it, yourself!
Hmphf!
Five!
...my own character will become suspect as well!
Let go of her!
"Kasuga Residence: Takashi, Kyosuke, Manami  Kurumi"
an1OH! He has a kid?!
So comfy!
Ushiko! Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?!
I wonder if it's because he looks like you...?
At that moment, I... I had this great urge to peek inside Ayukawa's mind!
Th... This, you see... is... er...
I believed in you... but you had a child!
...but you had a child!
It's not what you think, Hikaru! He's... He's my cousin!
Of course! He's your cousin! Oh! He's adorable!
What?!
What?! alphaHFFHuh?!
O... Oh... w...
H... Hey! What're you doing?!
What's wrong?
What?
Er... nothing...
Please let go of me!
He... tends to get carried away, and imagines things, y'know.
I had the feeling that was the case!
Say, Oniichan? Which do you really like?
I envy that...
...but I bet it'd be so much fun to have a brother that age.
I'll pass, thanks...
Darling, you have Kurumi and Manami.
Welcome back!
I thought that... I'd better do something, or else...
I'm... gonna be confident from now on!
Come now! Let's dance 'til the morning comes!
Tell Me, Tell Me, ...my Angel of the Summer...
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
Gosh! Do you have to agonize that much over it?!
Don't you know that more than anything, girls hate indecisive guys!
Certainly, what everybody's saying about me is true.
Oh... You're unfair!
Good morning!
How could you... start this early in the morning?!
What the...?!
Why's he fighting with himself?! What a weirdo!
You oaf! These are love letters! Love letters!
Got something in your eyes...?
Ta-da!
Hikaru! Will you please listen to what I've got to say?!
You'll love my salad for sure!
Can you believe what Darling did?
You're right.
He's just trying to look cool in front of you, that's all.
If you wanna vent your anger on someone...
What do you mean?
It's useless crying like a baby, you know.
If I seem that way...
Say, you 're kinda cute!
If I seem that way... it's because of you. rGreenOh! Gosh!
That's an unusual handshake!
The one that's in my heart is... you, and only you.
You know that, don't you?
Indecisive?!
Oh?!
What?! You mean, in front of everyone...
You caused total chaos, y'know!
OH MY...
Today, tomorrow and the day after that... He does lunch with ME!
Thanks for EVERYTHING!
Would you PLEASE let go of me?!
...then Ayukawa's mind could be...
All right now! First, breathe in deeply! And close your eyes!
Breathe in deeply...
Lucky! Lucky! I was looking everywhere for you, Darling!
What the...!? Hikaru...
K... Kazuya!
Indeed, Kazuya and I have switched places...
You put ketchup on my pencil case, didn't you?!
Take that!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Oh! Yikes! Yikes!
All right now!
A...Ayukawa!
Damn you! You think you can brush us off just like that?!
For the first time I'm in Ayukawa's room.
What? Oh, no, not really!
Say, Kazuya?
What?
Hey, Kazuya, you big liar!
Dating is absolutely no fun at all!
...let me do something nice for ya!
Wh...What?! Don't tell me that you'd... do that to Ayukawa?!
I forgot... I'm not Kazuya anymore!
You're the worst!
As we watched the horizon, I said good-bye.
Like seasons, hit songs come and go... As you get used to one, you're tired of it...
...with your T-Shirt on, you dove into the shining sea...
Tell me why, when you winked...
Er... well... this, y'see... is, er... simply a...
Huh?!
Oh... uh-huh. This and that...
Talk about a klutz, huh?
You're very welcome!
We hear there's a bitch 'round here who thinks she's fresh!
Tell the truth. It's for your own good, li'l boy!
M... Miss, I really don't know!
If everyone at school finds out...
My, why are you dressed up like that?
You never fail to amaze me; you're so athletic!
Well, y'know.
A... Ayukawa?! Wait for me!
Well, things feel pretty safe, at least during school hours.
Uh-huh! You look very good in it!
Lookin' good! Okay! Okay! This way!
Uh-huh! The perfect title for a cinema presentation on TV!
He who follows our damsel around like a pest: Chimpanzee Yuusaku!
You're adorable!
Yeah! You're daring!
See to it that she gets home safely, understand?
Go! Go! Okay? Let's get going!
The others knew... nothing about those delinquents...
Gimme a break!
I wanted it to be a secret though!
What?! They asked you girls too?!
That's my Darling!
Well...
Did something happen, Kasuga?
Welcome!
No thanks!
S...Sorry!
Oh... I was thinking of going to the hospital.
The hospital?! It was only open 'til noon. Today's Saturday.
Kasuga!
Y... Yoko!
Erase the memory of you from me... "Stop, Stop, Stop."
...that I find myself a wonderful boyfriend... and then...
As I tried to kiss you, as if to avoid me...
See this?! I'll be honest, how could you eat this?
...so I had to do the cooking for her at the last minute.
Who, me, Miss?!
Whew!
She's not from around here. Thinks she's special or somethin', maybe?
We don't like it when our turf's messed with.
"3 frogs and 3 frogs"
Oh! My contacts!
They're getting away!
Yes! Thank you so much for your help!
How expensive!
I'd be better off buying the materials and making one myself.
What?!
Each day, before I go to school, I do the laundry, cleaning...
Where is she?!
Yo!
This time, you'll play with us.
Shut up!
As we watched the horizon, I said good-bye.
Flare, Flare, Flare like the Sun, Fire Love...
It was a huge hassle just getting him back home!
Kazuya took advantage of the fact that Auntie was out...
Okay... Here it comes.
Oh! Well... Nothing much, really.
...something that just happens naturally... so...
You're walking on a tightrope with one arm out.
Hikaru told me about him.
...Jingoro is all alone by himself, isn't he?
Being alone...
Hey, guys! What are you up to?!
Pussycats! Pussycats! We can pick from a wide selection here!
A guy!
Oniichan!
You're scum...!
Huh...? Komatsu and Hatta...
What do you mean?
Your name and age are...?
S...Say, young man, how old are you?
Oh! It's so cute!
Um... Well... so this is what happens when Kazuya becomes a cat.
Er... Oh, nothing! At any rate, about Kazuya...
Hey, Kazuya! Will you help me out a little?!
Madoka's cat?
There's no doubt about it!
Why, you, Jingoro! Where'd you go?! I've been looking everywhere for you!
"If I recall... they hang out just outside of town."
...be so easily intimidated...
Mommy!
Well, you know... like they say, "Cats ought to be with other cats!"
Exactly who did she fall for?!
What?! Hayami, the guy from the Soccer Club?!
Next time: "A Tender Little Story! Kurumi's First Love - Chapter 'Hell' "
Now is no time for suicide!
That reminds me, Madoka's been acting strange lately too.
Maybe she's in love as well!
"Coach!"
I know it's a remote possibility, but...
D...Damn!
We're in the middle of practice!
All right! Let's get 'em!
I apologize, for not having written back. rWhiteOh, no.
Ayukawa!
Would you please hurry up, Manami?!
an1U-ma-o...?
...er... and so...
H...He's the epitome of indecisiveness!
Oh, c'mon!
Now, now. I only need a minute of your time, see. Okay? Okay?
Oh!
Er... I'll fix it right away!
Ta-da. That'll do it!
My job's done! Please take your time and enjoy your treat!
Kurumi...
...so I asked him... to ask Kurumi out on a date.
For Kurumi, it would've been better if I hadn't...
What?! rGreenWhat?!
Tell me! Who is he talking about?! Is it someone I know?
Tell me, won't you?
W...Well...
Huh?
But, you know, there are a lot of busybodies around you!
Good-bye!
As we watched the horizon, I said good-bye.
Like seasons, hit songs come and go... As you get used to one, you're tired of it...
I saw them, with their bags...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh! Ayukawa! Are those roses from Yuusaku?
Huh...? Hey, Ayukawa, what's your answer? C'mon!
We can't let the boys treat us as if we're toys or something!
Oooh, knock it off!
I've... I've...
How does it feel, being proposed to by a freshman?
Yes. Although who Yuusaku chooses to like is none of my business.
Let's go home together!
Girls are really... never, ever, easy to understand...
...exactly what Ayukawa is up to...
Madoka is such a comedienne!
She was holding Yuusaku's hand and all, oh, I just wonder!
Well, since we were little, Madoka's always...
...treated Yuusaku like her little brother, so...
Oh! I wonder... if it had to do with that...
"He said that before competing, everybody should get used to the scene!"
Darling, it looks like I've hurt him...
I...I'll be right there, okay?
What happened was...
He's the MAN!
He's the MAN!
What's he pissed about?
What?!
Cuz! Cuz, Madoka's the type that's like an older sister to everyone!
That's not true love, no way!
Right, Oniichan?
Manami, you're such an immature baby!
Don't feel obliged to commit double suicide just because...
No! Ayukawa wouldn't...!
"He wrote, 'I might be a loser for life!' "
"Ayukawa felt so bad for Yuusaku that..."
Er, I'll pay later!
N...Now, wait a second!
Sorry, but would you stop interrupting us?
...but, for now, just calm down and watch us.
Yuu, come on!
"He said he wanted to train by getting pounded on by the falls...
"...so I came along too."
"Huh...?"
"Hikaru was really worried..."
Kuroiwa grapples him and takes him to the floor!
Hikaru, here! Use this!
Flare, Flare, Flare like the Sun, Fire Love...
What?!
...to tell me that you'd be mine...
Oh Baby, Tell Me, Tell Me - I know that you're in love...
It's November the 15th!
Well, about tomorrow, er... it's my birthday, so... I was wondering...
Oh, sorry. I need to...
That's odd...
Why would a saleswoman be giving me such a sexy look?!
an1Hikaru!
...it just so happened... But, having said that...
...I had absolutely no intention of doing any such thing to begin with!
That means... Wait a sec here...
Yikes! I knew it!
You're awful!
Now, why would I do such a thing?!
I...I haven't gotten you a birthday present yet.
Are you awake now?!
There's no way they'll buy it!
Which means that wouldn't be as much of a problem as it has been.
Y...Yeah! Since I'm here, let's go ask Dad, Kurumi and Manami...
Dream on!
One of us has to leave this time-line.
So, this is the only way, eh?
So that's that. I'll leave! Farewell!
I've changed my mind! You go!
Umao!
Like that?
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It's withering in the winter..."
Next time: "Mystical Madoka! The Mushrooms of 120 Truthfulness."
It does me no good to discover your true feelings!
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
Is that for real?
Well, all their innermost secrets would probably be revealed!
Er... Well... What I mean is...
...so when I do, would you please have a bite, Darling?
Because...
Er..."Because this is the way you really feel, you say...
"'We celebrate the Mushroom on this late Autumn day.'
Nah! I left 'em behind with my mother as I was being delivered!
She thinks she's fresh or something!
Just watch! As soon as I find the Mushroom of Truth...
H...Hey, now wait a second!
What?!
Oh! That might be a good idea!
Huh? Oh! N... Er... Not yet.
I...I'm gonna try looking for them this way.
You'll be fine!
There! Oh, 'tis such a magnificent aroma!
I... I know I fool around too much, telling lame jokes every day.
I don't know how many days I've got left!
What a poor soul am I!
My...
...had feelings for you, Hikaru!
Here. Eat this!
I... came across it.
If I eat it... will you go back?
Don't panic!
S...Should I use the Power?!
Okay!
What?! Th...Then...
...after you got bitten by the snake...
Flare, Flare, Flare like the Sun, Fire Love...
Oh Baby, Tell Me, Tell Me - I know that you're in love...
It's so refreshing here!
Do you see something?
I wonder if he's all right...
Oh! Kyosuke, you're early!
Think so? Er, Grandma... That! That! That!
Oh! I know about all that.
You're awesome, Grandpa!
Huh...?
That's great, Yuusaku! You're the man!
"Tsubasa! Where have you been?"
"Tsubasa! What happened to your leg!"
"Just a fledgling, so to speak."
...fell in love.
Huh? Er... Well...
Oh. Is that so...?
"I was saved by your daughter."
Jingoro!
Good luck!
G...Grandpa!
Hikaru! It's started!
Y...Yeah...
As we watched the horizon, I said good-bye.
What's worse, I asked Ayukawa to...
Next time: "Perverted with a Camera! Robot Kyo-chan."
'Tell me you love me, Tell me that you need me...
...we'll make Kasuga do... THAT... and...
Now that's a good idea!
And, supporting and cradling their charms are...
Ain't it grand?! Ain't it grand?! Oh, it's too much for me to take!
Are you ready... Kasuga!
What do you mean "you girls?!" You too, Kazuko?!
"Something amazing?!" Right! You're right!
Just once in my life... I want to see that!
K...Kasuga?!
So that's it. No wonder Kyosuke-oniichan was like...
Hey, you! Were you up to your old tricks again?!
Kasuga...
Er... I'm stuck at ABCB today, so... take care, okay?
Here, take care of this for me, please.
Hiding somethin', aren't ya?
Huh? But...
Darling!
D...Darling...
O...Oh, gosh...
"You must be all sweaty."
"Let's take a bath together!"
Huh?
Oh! Really?
Right! Go take 'em!
Cigarettes... Nude pictures of Ayukawa...
Kasuga!
"Get me a pack of cigarettes."
Nude pictures of A... Ayukawa...
...then I'm gonna do the same!
What?! Oh, geez... Is... Is he serious?!
I told you, I ordered him to get me ice-cream right after that!
What does that mean?!
In short, you see...
Oh? What's with Madoka?
Well, er...
...before I realized it, I found myself here.
Unforgivable...!
...or so I, Kasuga Kyosuke, pondered...
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Broken Heart is in Flames. "It began in the summer..."
Tell Me, Tell Me - but you're a mystery.
Adios Kyosuke! Paranormal powers caught on video!
"Koryo Construction, Inc."
So that's it, huh? You guys were in this together!
Yes... That might be a good idea.
"Hey, Darling! Say something, won't you please?!"
1... 2... 3...
...basically a performance that symmetrically portrays...
To create agitation is the true meaning of being an independent film-maker!
Wh...What're you talking about?!
I wanna make it this kinda movie...
French babes  la carte!
How could I possibly just vanish?!
If he wants to play innocent until the bitter end...
...but, heck, you're dealing with Yuusaku!
Good! The sense of pursuit! The sense of fear!
Are you rolling, Hatta?
Hey, what's with this?!
How can you call yourself a member of Komatsu Productions...
...if you can't even ad-lib your way past an accident like this?!
It's damn obvious that they're trying to tape me using the Power!
I've had... this condition lately, facial tics... originally "facial ticks", which I assume would be ticks on one's face
But, Darling never let me know anything like that, not a hint.
How dare he keep it secret from his most beloved one?!
Well, well, well. We can leave it at that for the time being.
Your paranormal powers!
"I've got more friends than just these!"
Oh!
A...Ayukawa...
...this will be the final climax, so...
Y...Yeah...
"I want our memories...
You got some nerve, girl!
I've got more friends than just these...
I'm Asayami Sachi of Koryo Police School, 3-B!
Oh! Oh! I'm falling!
What?! Hikaru!
I know! I don't have to use the Power to teleport...
Oniichan!
Now it looks like...
Hey, Kasuga, have you got any idea what they're up to?
...that I have paranormal powers!
Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, Fire Love. "It burnt up in the fall..."
Next time: "Heroic Orange Legend! Madoka's Duel in the Blizzard."
A-ha-ha...
Got to be able to cry...
Heroic Orange Legend! Madoka's Duel in the Blizzard.
That wound! What happened?!
Where did she go?!
I won't let 'em get away with it! I'll get even someday, no matter what!
What?! They got you too?!
Isn't it?
H...Hey!
It's obvious you're trying to make Manami pity you!
Pun: "Dojo:" loach tiny eel-like fish or pity.
Kurumi? Manami?
I can't breathe!
We're twin... rGreen...bagworms.
Huh?!
Who knows?!
"Say something, why don't you!"
"Don't get involved with punks like these."
"You didn't even lay a finger on them."
'Cause, if you do... you'll be arrested for sure!
Madoka!
Brrrr, it's cold! There's no need for lookouts, y'know!
Oryuu!
What?!
Darling!
Darling!
Oh, geez! Oryuu!
"I just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
That'll do... Yeah!
I hung up the phone, when you called to cancel the date...
The color of my manicure, as it dries...
The Actress in the Mirror...
Hikaru, have fun...
Er... Well, lemme see... Go straight down this road...
In my neighborhood... she's known as "Tamiko the Disco Queen!"
It's so much fun in here...
Ayukawa!
Th...This can't be...
Ayukawa! Ayukawa!
Listen, er...
What?! rWhiteWhat?!
In my town... she's known as "Ruriko the Syncro-Swimming Ace!"
Back to the morning!
Right?!
Huh? Uh-huh!
Don't you agree, Madoka?
Even if I'm accused of double-dealing...
Yuusaku says... 'til he was in fifth grade...
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
...snowflakes dance on the platform, and you came running, out of breath.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Each time we're hurt we learn...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
Just kidding!
On usual, precious nights, I'd be riding by your side...
The Actress in the Mirror...
Hypnotizing Madoka! Kyosuke's Risky New Year's.
How about some Ozouni? Or...
Okay, that's it.
Say... Oniichan, what's wrong?
Let's just go, Papa. If we have to wait for Oniichan, we'll miss New Year's!
Ayukawa!
Well then, I'm gonna bear down and finish up my work here, Master!
Uh-huh...
Don't... you need to go?
"Toshikoshi:" served on New Year's Eve to wish longevity, good health.
Just kidding!
So, when I do something like that... Huh...?
What?!
Umao! Wherefore art thou, Umao?
Er, I mean, go get it for me.
Th...Thank you.
Er... Never mind!
...there was no way that we should be bathing together.
"Kanetsuki:" the ringing of large bells at Buddhist shrines on New Year's Eve.
Hey, girls!
Ayukawa!
You guys! What do you think you're doing here?!
Hey! Hold it!
Get me another one, why don't you?!
Master?
Y...Yuusaku!
Shazam!
...on top of your regular pay!
I declare that... that you...
"D...Darling... What are you doing here?!"
Still, Madoka, why did you decide not to go to America?
Huh?
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
The T.A.P. Guns!
each time I act, the truth leaves further...
...the seriousness of the crime. You've broken my heart.
I'll take point.
It stomached 8 missiles, and didn't even notice them!
Officer Komatsu? Officer Hatta? Are you all right?
What in the world is it doing here?
Now now!
That means...
No! You can't be so picky!
...which we believe to be the work of...
...and unbelievably, its claws and fangs can rip through the hardest alloys.
Are you listening to me?
"Dough?!"
I see. Money, eh...?
They aren't the only reason, are they?
What about that quiet little princess over there?
...but I'm sure that they've all given up.
Hi, kids! Have you all been doing okay?
Ughh...
Always... Always... We're grateful.
Kyosuke... Wherefore... Wherefore...
L...Lukewarm powdered skim milk?! I...I'm fine, thank you!
Help!
A cat from the gulf? From the gulf comes a cat...?
...Monster G is heading south along the stream towards Tokyo Tower!
As soon as that thing opens its mouth...
Yuusaku! Now!
Right!
The leader of TAP GUN, the squad that creamed Yojira and Redon...
Will Japan be overcome by this giant feline monster?!
Ayukawa...
Captain Ayukawa...
I've got some savings, so...
From now on, I'll put my heart into everything...
We can never be at the same place together ever again!
You bet! I mean, it's been a while since the three of us went out together.
Uh-oh!
A...Ayukawa? Huh?!
H...Hikaru! Hikaru, what happened to you?!
You'd better move her quickly, before everything starts up again.
Where am I... What am I doing...?
Oh, gosh! Obaasama...
Use it wisely, and I wish you luck with Hikaru.
"You're awesome, Kasuga!"
"Gee, you're too kind!"
M...Miss, please don't shout at an old man...
Why, you son-of-a...
'Scuse me for a second!
N...No! You've got it all wrong! The ball...
What do you think you're doing, Kasuga?!
Geez! Why can't you say "40-15!"
Huh? Bumble-bumble!
Whoa... Lose? Not me!
I am very sorry. I am an old man, as you can see.
What do you want, Baasan?!
Aren't you concerned about how Kyosuke's doing?
Just look how attractive she is, even though she's still in junior high.
Have you any idea where you've followed me to?!
Oh...!
A...Ayukawa! Thanks for before.
I just don't wanna let anybody else kiss her!
And so, we hung tough, and now we're only a point away from victory...
It...It won't stop!
What?!
"Snow White?!"
Sempai! My Snow White!
Wh... What happened...?!
At a train station on a faraway day...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Each time we're hurt we learn...
"I just dance in the sweet memories"
each time I act, the truth leaves further...
That's right.
"Just picturing in my mind your eyes, which hide the sadness within..."
"You'll regret this!"
What?! But, it was from a girl!
Uh-huh!
That can't be...
Look...
Oneesama, we'll make this house our Castle of Love...
I see...
N...Now...
Let go of me!
What the...?! What are you saying?!
Darling!
Kasuga!
I can explain...
Did you hear that about Kasuga?
We're complete strangers! Complete strangers!
Totally!
At any rate, we've got to get that tramp off Madoka's back!
You guys!
"I've finally made up my mind."
But... like I said...
Hey, Kasuga! Kasuga!
Maybe he's gonna fight Mr. Matsuoka!
Come on...
Likewise... Kasuga, I too have feelings for you...
My...
C'mon! This way!
Where would I be without you, Onee-sama?! What shall I do?!
Indeed... I understand just how Sumire feels.
The days we had to be apart made the memory of you...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
I... spent the night with Yukari after she invited me over.
Next time: "Heartbroken Hikaru! Follow Her to the Winter Beach."
Heartbroken Hikaru! Follow Her to the Winter Beach.
I put Darling down as our leader.
It'll be fine. You can learn to play anything quickly, Darling.
The Pikkaru's "brightly shine," you see... Right!
Yukari...
Shh! It'll be fine!
Can't get it off your mind, can you...?
Oh! No! I'm only in junior high, so...
...that I watched TV with Yukari, all night long.
"...just...
"...I was...
Well? It's not true, right?
Why did you have to lie?
Just what did you do to Hikaru?!
That's enough!
Let go of me.
If nothing happened...
Oniichan, it's terrible...
At a train station on a faraway day...
...snowflakes dance on the platform, and you came running, out of breath.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
It's the long-awaited Valentine's Day...
'Cause I love you...
"Yeah. Can you help me out at ABCB?"
"Sure. That's fine..."
Oh! Hey! Hey, you! Kazuya!
Hey! Hey! Kazuya!
You won't catch me that easily!
K...Kazuya!
Oh, gee! Gosh, Kazuya, got a cavity or something?
D... What?!
What are you doing, Yuusaku?
Yup! Yup! Yup!
...a girl like you, Madoka, might...
Huh... Oh! Oh, the chocolate...
And... in fact, you're even more sexy now!
Umao!
Geez! What does he think Valentine's Day is for?!
Yeah. Let's...Let's do that!
I worked so hard to make you a chocolate, Darling...
Here.
Gee, why that...
Madoka!
Now I've got no choice...
Oh my!
Isn't this your first time too, Madoka? Well?!
Maybe something came up with Kyosuke-oniichan!
...when shy damsels who can't usually say "I love you! I love you..."
Hikaru!
That's right, Darling!
All we need is a word from you, like...
Uh-huh...
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
Kasuga... looks like I won't ever be crying again.
Maybe it's because Hikaru was around... that I fell for you, Kasuga...
...I tried to pretend that there wasn't a scent of lie.
each time I act, the truth leaves further...
Sempai! Yippee!
An exchange-diary?
The "Exchange-Diary of Love!"
"...take... my bath...
Hunky-dory, eh?
I wonder if Hikaru's cold could get bad enough...
Kasuga! Where have you been?!
Did something happen, Komatsu?
They said... that she passed quietly, as if she'd fallen asleep.
Dad...
Would Hikaru be happy if she saw you crying?!
Yeah... First thing in the morning.
W...Why?!
Dad!
Yuusaku!
A very fine girl named Hikaru... suddenly passed away.
That's our Hikaru! Being dead doesn't bother you at all!
I'm willing to do anything... if you can bring her back!
Ushiko!
Hikaru... Hikaru...
I... can't live without you!
If you're looking for Hikaru, she was talking to Yuu a little while ago.
Kumagoro, the stuffed animal?!
'Cause, Sempai...
Yuusaku, go get my Kumagoro right this instant!
...I felt as if I didn't want Hikaru to be out of my arms.
Kasuga... I've been waiting for you...
I'm done!
...but uncertainty whispers into my ear...
The Actress in the Mirror...
'Cause I love you...
...I ended up coming along. It started out fine, but...
As soon as I found out that we'd be going on a ski trip...
Hikaru's impression of me will now completely change for the better!
Can't be...
Oh? You're right.
Oh... One minute. I'll be done soon.
Can it be that...
I'm done.
What in the world do you think you're doing?!
You're the one who didn't check which room you went into, Hikaru-oneechan!
Oh...?
Is she in the bathroom, I wonder...?
Oh! The bathtub!
Say! Say! Say!
Wanna go?
Care to explain what that yell was for?!
Oh... it's you, Jingoro.
Wanna go dancing with me?
Cheers! rGreenCheers!
Just leave, quickly!
I know that already!
Kasuga... This way!
C'mon! Hurry!
Hey!
I don't know!
What is it?
...I... l...
You said it.
How I wish that I could be alone with her forever!
There's no reason to be so concerned about it!
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
See? There you go!
Oh? He's not back yet? Oh well...
Oh, er...
"Night  Day"
Dance! Dance!
Wait, you! Kazuya!
Hey, you!
I hung out with some other guys!
But I didn't have an affair!
...snowflakes dance on the platform, and you came running, out of breath.
"I just dance in the sweet memories" ...what it takes to love someone.
What?
On usual, precious nights, I'd be riding by your side...
'Cause I love you...
...the seriousness of the crime. You've broken my heart.
Suddenly, amidst the light... there appears an angel.
...amidst this dazzling light and gentle breeze...
What's the matter?
Go for it!
Just what's up, folks?! Is he confident? Or saying "to hell with it!"
Could you quiet it down just a l...
Huh? This park can't be the...
What is she thinking?!
"Yuusaku?"
Stop crying!
That'll be 450.
Huh?! What's with this 100 coin?!
T...Toy?!
Huh? Er... Nothing...
At noon?!
A-ha! That's neat!
Will you get off my case?! Go away! Don't you have any friends?!
Like this tree here.
Get 'em!
Yeah... I'll use my Power, and then...
Oh, er... Grandpa... would you happen to know?
D...Don't tell me... you're... a girl?!
A skirt?!
Yeah...
All right? Thanks for helping me!
But, my...
...now that I'm ready to take the fall, it seems like a long way!
You just wait... We'll let you go, as soon as we catch that alien!
It's an alien!
Thanks, oniichan.
Promise me!
...snowflakes dance on the platform, and you came running, out of breath.
...but uncertainty whispers into my ear...
The Actress in the Mirror...
Suddenly, amidst the light... there appears an angel.
...and, at that moment, I could not speak.
You'll catch a cold if you take a nap there!
See? Finals are getting to you, huh?
I was thinking that this is just like that day, long ago.
...to meet again in six years, right here.
Oh? Oh, gosh, Darling!
There! There!
Go! Go! Jingoro the Great! Go!
Could you quiet it down just a l...
Huh? This park can't be the...
"Yuusaku?"
"Yuusaku?" You're crying like a baby again!
They are brave and trust- worthy, yet gentle...
T...Toy?!
Then... what was it that I saw before?
What?!
How many times do we have to hurt ya, before you give up?!
"Do you understand, Kyosuke? When you're 'timeslipped, ' you should...
"...never interfere with the course of events in the past!"
How dare you touch 'em, you two! Oh!
Hey, you! No drooling allowed!
D...Did you see that?!
Pervert!
...be sexy, and... wear a cute skirt or something like that.
Yeah...
I get it... That explains why you were going after my sister.
Grandpa!
A while back...
Hikaru!
Ayukawa!
So you're it, eh...? What they call an "alien?"
...the one that I caught in the air, as it was blown by the wind.
...the "past" for Ayukawa and everybody else must've changed a lot.
Yeah! I promise! In six years... right here!
"l just dance in the sweet memories" Sweet memories
...a happy one, like seeing your photograph.
"l just dance in the sweet memories" He's my one and only; you never can tell
"l just dance in the sweet memories"
On usual, precious nights, I'd be riding by your side...
The color of my manicure, as it dries...
Got to be more straightforward to say it...
...but uncertainty whispers into my ear...
The Actress in the Mirror...
...and further from my face. You've broken my heart.
There's no turning back now that I've realized...
Yeah.
Bye-bye!
Grandpa brought you here?!
Kasuga! What's going on here?!
Where on Earth did Darling go?!
On top of that, even Madoka isn't home!
Yes... I'm "Ushiko."
Yeah.
Darling, he laid his hands on me!
Hold it, you son-of-a-bitch!
Manami... Kurumi...
Grandpa warned me once, now that I remember...
Hold it, you!
Inside!
A kid... came in here just now, didn't he?
I hate cops, y'know...
Say...
You're gonna be answering me today for sure!
A-ha... You look just like my sister!
Say... What made you think that I was his girlfriend?
I wish you the best.
Ayukawa!
What... was that voice?!
Are you ready?
That someone was, well...
...a "first kiss."
This...
Your cancellation call smelled of a lie. I hung up, pretending not to notice.
You've broken my heart.
You don't look at all like a junior high school student!
Hmm, I wonder where the shampoo is?
Hey, hey!
Yeah, nice and smooth! Right, right!
"Gakun:" The sound of great disappointment.
Old folks... always trying to crack jokes with young people...
W... Well, it happens to have a great deal to do with it.
Well, if you value your lives...
Th... That's not what I mean...!
H... Hikaru...!
What a natural!
Y... You all right?
Nothing...
Huh?
Ayukawa...
Right, right! That's why it'd be better for you to come with us!
...might have something to do with each other.
The daughter of the village squire and the son of a hunter fell in love...
It was there that the two made a pact.
...the girl lost her footing and fell into a pit!
...the girl was entombed in lava in the depths of the earth...
But the girl thought that he had let go of her only to save himself.
It's no good giving yourself the shakes when you're doing the talking! C'mon!
Ayukawa! h
Corpses? h
Th... They're gone!
Could they have been just a dream...?
"A man and a woman fell in love..."
What... What's going on?
Ayukawa!
Y... You're wrong! He didn't let go of your hand on purpose!
That's all that matters to me!
I... I'll let go, all right...
Kasuga!
"As if in a dreamworld..."
You've broken my heart.
We were greeting our second morning here. It was heaven, a true paradise.
Everything had been just fine, up until yesterday...
...but suddenly, without warning, it happened.
I want to cast a spell over your playful spirit...
Oh, so did I! I'll go get them, Kyosuke.
Hurry up.
No, it's a mistake, a mistake!
"Speak Japanese! Hey, are you listening? Hey! Hello!"
What does it mean?
Wh... What is it, Ayukawa?
Yeah.
Well, then, do something about this.
I'm going to cast a spell. Go on, close your eyes.
Who'd have thought that my first vacation abroad would end up like this...
I've been mistaken for the daughter of a company president.
This sort of thing must happen a lot.
Princess! Together we shall return to Japan!
Yes!
Yeah.
Madoka!
"But I'll never forget the moment when I genuinely feared for my life."
...we cannot keep ourselves apart.
...because lovers' hearts are whimsical indeed.
Thank you, Father, for always bringing us all this natural food...
With these great ingredients, we can cook up something wonderful.
A magic... rWhite...rope?
I... I've become Grampa! Wow! This is neat!
...don't get fresh with the girls!
So this thing switches spirits, huh?
G... Goldie!
Why don't we go in now?
It's a small place. He'll find us for sure.
What the hell is that jerk doing?
Sure, there were times when I've wished I could be a goldfish...
Here, there's no lousy homework, it's nice and cool, even in summer...
Don't worry, Madoka...
Hey, Madoka, wanna have a contest?
To see which of us can catch this goldfish!
Ayukawa too!
It... It was a seduction sweet enough to make me forget that I was a goldfish...
Ick!
I... I guess so. Besides, I promised I'd go over to your house tonight...
Looks like he got caught by someone after all. Poor Kyosuke.
Hey... that's it! Jingoro! After trying to catch Goldie so much...
...you ought to at least remember what he smelled like! rGreenOh! What a great idea!
Good-bye now!
What's this?! Get out of here, you stray cat!
If we wait, he'll probably come home sooner or later.
Now listen! Right now, Jingoro is our good-for-nothing brother!
No way! You mean, this cat, who looks like Jingoro...
...I... I thought to myself, "How lucky I was to have become a cat..."
A... Ayukawa too? Even considering the wine...
This cat's confused as to which way it should go. How indecisive!
Thanks!
Well, now. I should probably take a shower, huh?
Damn... If only I could use my power...
Wha... What the...?
Kyosuke!
A... Ayukawa's talking about me in her sleep...
Kyosuke!
Oh no!
Thank you, Kitty. You saved my life.
...but...if I had remained in Jingoro's body just a few seconds longer...
"What's that?"
Anyway, you'd better get yourself together!
Aren't you the crafty one?
Yeah.
Hey, that's Hikaru!
Pretty hot, aren't you! h
Huh?
Yeah, well, it's 'cause it's really nice to see you again, after so long...
What is it?
I'll be right back, okay? h
Hey! No fair, Akane! h
Hey! No fair, Akane! rWhiteHuh?
Oh, it's you, Kurumi!
Yep!
Kasuga!
Go on, Kyosuke! Your girlfriend's calling! Your girlfriend!
H... Hey...!
So sorry!
You're terrific, Madoka!
Uh, thanks.
She's been deceived by that jerk Kyosuke's sweet talk.
Say, Madoka!
Uh, but...
Stop it...!
Uh, um...
I'm not that kind of girl!
This is bad!
Who the hell are you?
A... Ayukawa! h
No!
Credits have been deleted; use the imagesub tracks to view them.
The sunrise brings back memories, and this feeling of love...
Choose me, and let's fall in love.
"Listen, Kasuga, can you do me a favor?"
You could go North, West, South, or East tomorrow, you're so whimsical.
Ow!
...th... the one and only...
Here! Hop in! rWhiteWha...
Step on it, driver! rWhiteYes, ma'am!
Oh, come on! You don't have to play the star in front of me.
Huh?
Well, I bet you're hungry. Shall we go get some dinner?
Can you believe it? A regular girl treating a superstar idol?
Hey...
You've lost a little weight, haven't you?
Back in high school, the two were in the Broadcasting Club together...
Well, I'm glad you managed to become a singer, Kazuto!
Well! This Hayakawa Mitsuru's got a few points on the plus side after all!
I see you're pretty popular with the girls, huh!
Not you, Hayakawa Mitsuru. rWhiteI AM Hayakawa Mitsuru!
Someone just said "Hayakawa Mitsuru..."
...all the guys are llike that, babe!
Th... There you are!
The real thing?
Welcome back... Kazuto.
Don't cry. h
...a womanizing idol singer.
...I was very uncomfortable about just how much Hayakawa Mitsuru...
Dance with me again!
I was dreaming that I was cheering on Ayukawa, who was on stage.
Yeow! It was only a joke! Really! Stop it! Ouch!
OUCH!
"Fire Extinguisher"
Hang on, Yukari!
Yukari should know that too.
Yeah.
Darling, he really is such a snob.
Okay, folks! No unauthorized entry is allowed beyond this point!
Looks like I can't get in that way.
...the premiere of Hayakawa Mitsuru's new single, that is.
I don't belong to you alone. You're looking for pure love? Don't make me laugh!
Wow! It's like a flower shop in here!
When that happens, I won't be able to stay in this town.
I hope Darling's all right.
Huh? Ayukawa! Ayukawa!
...but Ayukawa onstage...
Please allow me to sing.
Me too.
Okay, guys, let's go home.
Like Hayakawa Mitsuru said: we'll just start all over again.
In the end, because Shuu and the guys went home...
...there was no one to receive the Grand Prix.
...the show never did get shown on TV.
What was it about me?
That's high-school love.
"Oh, you idiot! Stay away!"
"Don't embarrass me..."
Well... actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
"Oh, nothing..."
Right.
But I think that putting on an act like this is actually quite feminine...
Darling isn't here?
Mm-hmm.
Cold, naive boyfriend...
...give more love to me soon and always.
...look, listen, and hold tight to love.
What for?
Right, right, right.
I know Akane's only acting, but it's getting pretty intense...
Then what's it gonna take?!
My wallet! Yeah, my wallet's missing!
Huh?
What's wrong, Darling?
Cut it out. h
Yeah...
Huh? Oh, uh... yeah! I found it!
Well, I've shared drinks with my boyfriend before...
Then what WILL convince you?!
Too easy!
What! rGreenWhat!
Okay...
Huh? Oh...
WHAT?! rGreenWHAT?!
A... Akane?
From this point on, you can't come in.
What are you talking about? You two said you wanted proof, didn't you?
Where's Akane?
Akane and Kyosuke? rWhiteCould... that be...
I can't stand it...
I probably have no right to say this, since I helped out with this lie...
What matters is whether you can find someone you can care for that much.
That makes three of us! rGreenThat makes three of us!
Darling!
Deep eyes the color of the ocean...
All the days go by at high speed.
Sign: "Mr. Ayukawa"
Oh, man! He's speaking Japanese! Japanese! Thank God!
...whose work keeps him overseas most of the year.
A... Ayukawa...
Weren't we supposed to go out for dinner?!
Ma... Madoka...
See, Darling, it's after such a wonderful concert.
Oh, this is too much for me!
I hope your father didn't play wrong notes!
He said he's just about to leave the hotel...
A... Ayukawa?
Kurumi and Manami's big mouths again!
"Master:" nickname of the snack-bar owner.
Kyosuke must be out somewhere! Master, I'll go look!
Oh, I know! Want me to cook something for you?
"Welcome home, dear!"
...it's as if we were newlyweds.
Huh? No, no, really, no!
Y... Yeah...
Then I'm staying!
Ayukawa and I, under the same roof.
Say, Ayukawa...
My goodness, Kyosuke, your line's been busy all this time!
It was all Ayukawa's misunderstanding.
It's Dad's curry and rice! Are you gonna eat, or what?
One more chance, now; whisper something in my ear.
Yeah...
Please make sure to come and see the play I'm in!
Darling... please make real sure you come see the play!
Oh...!
"Downtown Cats...?" Wow, a real masterpiece!
"Yoyo Seminars for seniors and high school grads"
Yeah, I checked out a bunch of places; this one seems to be the best deal.
I wonder if there aren't some more exciting guys somewhere...
"You'd better give us some money..."
Um, well... I think I survived.
Dad's out right now, so... if you get him too excited...
...you'll be in trouble!
Darling, I'm gonna root through the cupboard, okay?
But I'd sure love to cook something healthy and tasty for you here...
Is it distracting?
Let me fly until I fall apart.
Understand? The foundation of your studies should be data.
Hikaru looked so happy. Nice going.
Ayukawa!
Hey! You in the back row!
Geez... you're not listening, are you?
We all went together last year, remember?
Hikaru...
So anyway, how's the play going?
Huh? What do you mean?
Wh... what?
Right, right! Here you lay down for just a second,
After all, compared to Ayukawa, she'd be an easy fish to catch!
...that no such concept is substantiated anywhere in the problem itself...
Yeah...
"Study hard...?"
Speaking of him, is Kasuga still taking that summer course with Ayukawa?
I see...! Madoka, you're so good...
There're some better ones up in my room, so why don't you bring them down?
Oh, did you find them, Hikaru?
You never change, do you, Hikaru?
What...? No, no! That's not what I meant...
On a terrace in the afternoon light...
Hello, Kasuga residence.
I've done a foolish thing...
Yeah...
...is my punishment for assuming that...
Huh? Now, how many did I just do...? Let's see...
"I'm a hooker, you say? But why is that so terrible?"
You don't look so good...
Hello? It's me!
So anyway, I got some of my allowance today, and so I...
Yes, I know I shouldn't see you anymore...!
Okay, today I'm going to cover the important guidelines for solving...
"Yes. Day before yesterday."
"l told her we shouldn't see each other anymore, but..."
Yes?
Nameplate: "Hiyama"
I really, really got them for free, and so...
Please go home. I have to leave for the summer course soon.
To go study with Madoka?
We probably won't get another chance to for a while...
Okay. See ya.
I know, Hikaru... I'm sorry...
Why do you have to think like that?
Kazuya, I love both you and Tatsuya!
And we'll always be together from now on, too. That's how it should be...!
Hmm. Okay, how about this? The landing of the "Riifude." rGreen1600.
Out...
I just can't give up on you...!
Hold Me Again.
...I will not forget...
Kasuga Kyosuke
Hiyama Hikaru
Yippee!
"Downtown Cats...?" Wow, a real masterpiece!
Yes! And this time especially, as a Koryo graduate, Isao Kobayashi...
'Cause Darling really loves sweet things!
Darling, please stay seated. I'll take care of everything.
I mean, if nothing else, I know I'm a good cook!
No, it's got a nice ring. And I can't stand it if it's too quiet.
Really? That's great...
I'll dub this for you sometime.
It was like the sweet taste of coconut-almond...
...and pound the information into your head.
Ayukawa!
Hey! You in the back row!
Uh... Sure... One order of fries, then.
Good afternoon! I can help you over here!
Soon it'll get colder, and you can't afford to catch cold, can you?
Yeah...! Can we go to the festival together, Darling?
Yeah.
Well... I guess it's goodbye for another few days... I don't want to be apart...
What's the matter?
Right, right! Here you lay down for just a second,
What?
Didn't you come here to study?!
Man... this sucks! Why do the college entrance exams have to be...
Aren't you overdoing things a bit, though? There are bags under your eyes.
Yes, I've found you out! But we're not talking about studying, now, are we?!
You have, right?
All right... very good!
And like a certain "Miss Ayukawa," you're from Koryo High, right?
Yes, sir!
That's right! He took the festival photography job because it was for our town.
Hey! Don't touch!
Shoo, shoo!
No, you idiot! We'll help you out, "Dad!"
Speaking of him, is Kasuga still taking that summer course with Ayukawa?
But for some reason, Madoka hasn't been going for the past 2 or 3 days...
Oh, it slipped out again!
So... So that's for... Kasuga...
I bought this yukata... to show respect for my dad.
What...? No, no! That's not what I meant...
...are melting in the ice tea too.
"I love you, I love you. "
I pretended not to notice...
Hello...?
And so...
...is my punishment for assuming that...
Kasuga... I want to see you...
What...?
'Cause you kissed me, didn't you?!
What?
Ayukawa!
I hope everybody's read the problem.
But I...
We'll have to settle all of this pretty soon, won't we?
This is from a troubled 16-year-old girl...
I can't believe that...!
Snack provisions!
I told you already! I'm...
Kyosuke! It looks like I'm gonna get the lead role!
Really...
Even so... I clung to the hope that there was something I could do to...
Madoka, what have you ever done for him?!
Hikaru... I guess it really can't be the three of us anymore...
Which came first, the Koan or Bun'ei War? rWhite Koan.
What...? What was that...?
...crime committed in 1980...
What are you thinking, coming here this late at night?
I'm going back home, now...
Actually... About last night...
Hikaru's play opens today, doesn't it?
"Oh, come on, Darling! Who else could that be but Madoka?"
...were both accepted.
I swung on...
...was terribly small.
Hold Me Again in that sky.
Fin
When I was 22 years old
at both times in my life
Your eyes were shaking faintly.
today...
It was the first time I saw you looking puzzled.
She's always been a good girl.
Oh, no, Darling!
I... I can do anything for him.
I shouldn't have mentioned Hikaru, should I?
The timing was right.
Right, Grandma?
A shadow?
Kasuga!
It was a mysterious feeling.
Wow! I can't believe this! You're Kasuga-sempai, aren't you?
Yes, I live over there now.
Well, would you please wait here while I make a quick phone call?
"Wow! I can't believe this! I'm so excited to see you!"
My attitude was exactly the same when he dumped me.
I realized that I hadn't seen Hikaru for a long time.
Great! You had that conversation with him in English, didn't you?
Hikaru!
Hikaru, where are you staying?
I was staying at her place, but she is also one of the participants.
If so, before I disappear
your heart, things like that.
What?
I told you I'm not an idol star any more. So, how's my idea?
I don't want to be around a woman who's always chasing
I knew for sure something happened to the me who lived in this time.
Even if Ayukawa was a ghost...
that I would be able to jump in front of her again.
No way!
Do you know him? That story's big news all over Japan.
That's right. You see, Kyosuke was hit by a car three years ago,
What do you mean?
Crashed into?
Kyosuke of three years ago is somewhere in the present?
Come on, yeah
Hikaru!
No way!
Well, I have a good idea.
Kyosuke!
if the judge tells me my dance is unique and I get the part!
But it's none of my business! Nothing to do with me!
Let's have a party, right, Sempai?
Unfortunately, Ms. Hiyama is not in her room.
Her companion?
A green caterpillar rolling, rolling...
Hikaru...
Well, I shouldn't talk about losing or gaining.
Yes, I'll be right there!
Why? Why didn't you come to me right away?
Madoka...
You can say what you want.
Don't say such a stupid thing, idiot!
Focus the superhuman power of the Kasuga family into a single point!
So, if someone stays there too long,
Well...
Here, use this.
Hey, Kyosuke!
I don't know. It looks like some star coming back to Japan maybe.
Yes, I guess so.
Really? But what about Ayukawa?
It was so painful for all of us
Yes, Hikaru is a good girl.
I understand. Okay, I will.
Yes, under lots of pressure.
Yes, I heard about that. I punished him soundly.
I don't care if someone sees me.
on such an important night.
I can't believe you, Kasuga.
Kasuga...
Soba ni iru yo
at both times in my life
Shut up and listen. Watch out for the car. Understand?
Shut up and listen, Kyosuke! I repeat. Watch out for the car! Or...
Damn!
but the first place you won in this contest is worth a lot to you!
Well, then...
Of course.
Good luck.
she sounded like she found friends pretty quickly.
Oh, no, Darling!
Hikaru was like a younger sister to Ayukawa.
However, at some point, we became unable to share shining memories.
That musical... She said, "Please promise to come see the play."
Right, Grandma?
I didn't know what was going on.
No, not here.
so he has no idea where Master went.
It was probably built here because I was hit by the car.
Your height, well...
It's cool, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, I think I heard that from the Master of Abcb.
Geez, I hate this! I just met you dramatically after a long time.
My attitude was exactly the same when he dumped me.
I'm not a smart girl, so I need my memo pad.
Yes, it is. The musical is on quite a big scale too.
Hikaru, where are you staying?
I was staying at her place, but she is also one of the participants.
Yeah, that's right. It was too early.
Idiot! She's so gorgeous. Men won't leave her alone!
If so, before I disappear
If so, if that's true, I... I...
Mitsuru Hayakawa?
The other song you wrote was a perfect match for that TV drama.
the ghost of Kyosuke Kasuga.
and the circumstances around me were not getting better at all.
Kyosuke Kasuga 22 years old
In Bosnia the search continues for a missing Japanese student,
Yes, yes, it's me. How are you?
Otherwise, I don't understand why Kyosuke is missing in Bosnia.
Well, I'll explain the details later. Listen, Madoka,
Yes, I wanna see some dream with you
Oh, I know her!
...extend arms and one, two, three, four, five, then pose.
Hi, Ayukawa is not able to take your call.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Madoka Ayukawa's red straw hat...
99!
We went round and round...
Please do that.
Kasuga?
Oh, my God, what will I do
New York Actors' Studio.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
But... But I just thought...
I just want both of you to be happy,
not like me.
She came back to the hotel with her companion,
Her companion?
Are you all right?
Madoka, the angel charm you sent me
See you soon - Hikaru
Oh no, what are you doing?
You said, "Ayukawa, Ayukawa!"
No way!
you might make a beautiful lady like me mad,
Ayukawa and Hikaru are connected with a strong bond
which I'll never be able to imagine.
even though I was an infamous bad girl years ago?
Is that so?
In other words, the 22 year-old Kyosuke, who lives in this time
Don't say such a stupid thing, idiot!
Hey, Ayukawa, you too?
We might be too late.
Are you saying that my brother will continue to sleep there?
Three years ago, do I have to die?
Well, it's about time for bed.
All right then!
You can sleep on that sofa, can't you?
Excuse me, but do... Do I sleep here by myself?
What's that? Hikaru, what happened to you?
Hey, over there, that way!
What's that about?
However, once I got there, I couldn't escape.
Hey, hey!
It was so painful for all of us
the things happened that summer.
Hey, it was all your fault, Kyosuke from three years ago.
Well, you'll see when you get back. You'll see.
Liar.
Oh no, Kasuga!
Oh no, you sound like a father.
Oh no, what are you doing?
Kake dashita kitsu no oto, kokoro ni nibiku
Sekai wa koko da to omou
When my 22 year old self...
And like a fool, I was shaking more than you were.
This is Kasuga...
Anyways, be careful with a car... Got it?
Me?
W-What kind of joke is this?!
That stupid guy! I was having a good dream about Ayukawa!
You're so brave...
Okay then...
That was because the three of us were becoming adults.
Am I not enough for you?
DON'T IGNORE ME!!
I wasn't ignoring you...
And I was asked to come to the musical, no matter what...
I see...
Kyosuke, be careful of a car.
The stairs near my house...
Yeah, I can't tell whether it's the future or the past...
Yes, yes!
It was a coincidence that he was in an accident...
Walking around?
Speaking of which, you've become sexy since I last saw you.
Well, anyway...
I didn't know what was going on.

Afterwards, ABCB sold everything, including the name and the property rights.

25
Madoka-san!
I see that you've grown...
Yes, that right. I'm living there...
Maybe she's talking with a guy.
Yes! That's right...
It's going to be something big.
My friend over there just informed me.
I just wanted to try out for auditions.
Well, yeah...
Hikaru-chan...
I have to go...
Because your face shows that something is wrong.
Well, er...
Idiot, idiot, idiot!
At that time, I thought she asked me if I was feeling okay.
Well, things don't seem to be too good, not now.
That car is...
I... I want to see the truth...
Without me...
...but the only person who can help you is I, Hiyakawa Mitsuru.
No way! That's Kasuga-senpai...
You are not too good, huh?
We've been in the jungles of Hawaii.
I just heard the news about Kyosuke's disappearance.
You must be having a hard time dealing with all that has been happening.
Oh... Things are bigger here. Must be why Japan lost the war.
Remember 3 years ago?
What do you mean?!
...the one receiving the greater shock, fell into another dimension...
If we combine the power of Kyosuke from 3 years ago...
Anyway, I will be there soon, so please find Kyosuke from 3 years ago, okay?
We've different dream.
Yes, I wanna see the same dream with you.
This lovin' I have for you, it's never change.
Ayukawa's...
I counted from the beginning.
Kyosuke!!
Why are you avoiding Madoka-san if you are alive?
Kyosuke...
Try another girl!
Entry number 59, Hiyama Hikaru...
Not at all...
Well let's not talk about another topic.
Well... Yeah...
Cheers!
Companion?
This is not good...
..is always with me.
I didn't do it,'' did I?
Hey, Kasuga-senpai...
Huh?
Senpai...
I had ordered some coffee.
That's why we...
No, it's not like that...
But...
Is that so...?
It's just that they're important...
Here I go!
I wish this time continues forever...
In this time, your sudden appearance displaced the 22 year old Kyosuke.
Minami-chan and I are 20, while you, Kyosuke-kun...
Ayukawa, not you too?
T-Then, does that mean he'll sleep there forever?
Kyosuke Number One?
It appears the student cameraman, Kasuga Kyosuke, has been found unharmed.
Geez, what kind of story is that?
The 22 year old Ayukawa Madoka is just what a woman should be.
Hey, young one...
Here, you go can use these.
Well... am I, er... supposed to sleep here alone?
Hikaru, whatever happened to Sugisawa-san?
Hikaru, you silly...
And the two of them are being covered by hundreds of flashing cameras.
I made you wait, Kyosuke...
A battlefield, huh?
All the way to the battlefield?
You couldn't do it'' with Hikaru-chan, could you?
I would've definitely DONE IT.
Huh?
Oh, that...
Let's see... When was it?
T-That's right... H-How was it?
Go back...
I will apologize for the several months, starting today.
Say, when was it?
Please, Kasuga-kun...
But...
I was just wondering that perhaps one day...
...I would give birth to an ESPer.
I just thought that, but you are just perverted.
I didn't know I was this primitive.
...in this situation, calling me Ayukawa, Ayukawa.''
Kyosuke C3Tohru Furuya
...carassing the wind, quietly ripples my shirt.
I believe our hearts are alike.
I love you!
Day Dream, my day dream!
You're trembling a little bit out of shyness.
It was the first time we crossed the line from being friends to lovers.
What are you talking about?
Listen carefully, Kyosuke...
Yes, that much...
It is, it is...
Okay then!
Kasuga
She also apologized for not even saying a goodbye because of the sudden move.
Yeah...
Whoa...
Hikaru-chan was like a little sister to Ayukawa since they were kids.
But, then came a time...
Madoka-san, you are not fair.
I... I will do anything!
If it's for senpai, I can do anything!
Not enough...
After graduating from high school in Otaru...
...she mentioned traveling to New York to study musicals.
At that time, I've completely forgot about this morning's phone call.
Kyosuke, be careful around cars.
Kasuga-kun!
I... I thought I was hit by a car?
Where am I?
Why am I here?
Is it possible to slip through time that easily?
Grandpa!!
No way!
It hasn't even been 3 years since I've moved here!
Maybe I moved to another room.
It was probably constructed after my accident here.
It was a weird feeling...
Darling...
Hikaru-chan?
I've had 3 years to mature.
What? New York?
The Master of ABCB mentioned your phone call.
At a time like this? I'm having a dramatic reunion with senpai.
Go ahead, go ahead...
Hello, Shuri... Did you get a hotel room yet?
She's probably talking to a guy.
My friend over there just informed me.
This isn't an English class.
What the hell am I thinking?
...that if I couldn't come to Otaru, at least to say hi' to my old friends.
Senpai has always done mysterious things like that.
She says that Kasuga-kun seems to have a secret.
It would've made Hikaru-chan unhappy...
I...
I...
...even though you treat me coldly.
Something has certainly happened to me in this time period.
Kyosuke...
I wanted to run to Ayukawa's place as soon as possible.
No way! That's Kasuga-senpai...
Hi! Aloha Madoka-chan!
That's right, that's right! How are you doing?
I'm sorry about that...
...and cannot come back.
Grandma, tea please!
Yes!
Anyway, I will be there soon, so please find Kyosuke from 3 years ago, okay?
...in bed.
A red straw hat...
Eh! No way!
1...2...3...
Nothing...
We are going to the apartment where he use to live.
I knew you'd be here.
Since this is a rare reunion, let's have a drink together.
Yeah...
Hikaru-chan seemed to be used to this kind of thing.
5:39 PM
...but it's still great.
W...Wait a minute! Don't hang up!
Close friend?
Let's just drink and have fun tonight, okay senpai?
I can transfer the call to the restaurant.
Gentleman?
I will transfer the call now.
You want water?
This is not good...
I've received the same number of handmade gifts...
...it was snowing outside.
You're lying...
...pretty lame, or my loss.
I wanted to see you, Hikaru.
That is why last night was so dangerous.
That's why I felt I had to tell you about it, Madoka-san.
You really did it this time!
...but you cannot see it because it is a scalding afternoon.
In 3 years, am I going to die?!
Hey, hey...
Hold it right there, boy.
Huh?
Hey, Kyosuke...
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Please face the camera.
And the two of them are being covered by hundreds of flashing cameras.
In the beginning, it was just a coincidence.
But once stuck, I couldn't get out.
Do you think she'll find out?
If she finds out, you'll be in big trouble.
Yes, I got it.
You were gonna die a virgin, weren't you?
Amazing!
Madoka...
Did Kyosuke from 3 years ago go back yet?
I don't mind if anyone sees me.
Well, here is my celebration present to Kasuga-kun, part one.
W...What?
Damn it!
I will always remember that you were very clumsy at a time like this.
Well, er, I...
It's safe tonight.
I can't believe you, Kasuga-kun...
A...Ayukawa...
S...Something around here...
Kasuga-kun....
Summer
...carassing the wind, quietly ripples my shirt.
Original Translation: Beefbowl Anime

And that kid gavein to Madokas patience...
Ayukawa.
But I didnt.
Umao,wherefore art thou Umao ?
I didnt know what to do.
and III be in Karuizawa over the Iong hoIiday, so...
You can go with us.Lucky you !
Start packing !
Then take care of things whiIe were away.
And yes, in the nurses office I hugged Hikaru,
but I was haIf asIeep when...
Which do you want ?This one, or that one ?
This time for sure.10 meters in front ofthe bus.
Oh shoot !
Youre too sharp for me, Madoka.
So thats it. Though I was reIieved, I feIt Id badIy misjudged Ayukawa.
It was kind of sudden, so Im a IittIe worried.
Ifthey find out...
Its bound to turn out Iike that.
III deaI with those two.
Make it two.
But the weekend was over so quickIy and...
WeII...
Shes aIways nagging me about that.
You had a date with Hikaru.
Ayukawa
Did you just finish work ?
Brother, when are you going to get up ?! Brother !

Dad !
Her ? It cant be.
And THAT was strongerthan my Power, so...

Damn, hes here again. How did he get here so fast ?
You havent memorized this yet ? This is 7th grade stuff.
See you tomorrow.
What are you Iooking at ?
Nothing...

Why dont we go to the bookstore by the station after schooI ?
I found a good exercise book there.
Somewhere eIse ?
Of course not.You cant cheat Iike that.
Im tired.

Its the daybefore the test !
What are you doing here, Kasuga ?
He just said so now. Since he was IittIe, he was in Iove...
WeII...
Sure. Just a sec.
Thats my water, you know.
Jingoro, dont move !
I cant beIieve you coIIected aII this.Youre sure into fan cIubs.
But Im not as intimate with Hikaru as you guys think.
She wasnt asunheaIthy as you are !
WonderfuIIy unheaIthy.
Ifyou dont want to,its okay.
Hey, you two.
This, that, and that, and that...
Dont you thinkyoure being rude ?
What ?
Everybody treats me Iike a kid. You think the same thing, right ?
Im not a kid that gets drunk on just five gIasses of some weak drink.
Im not a boy.
I cant beIieveyou made it back.
Oh no !
Hikaru wasIooking for you.
Kasuga, hurry. Ifyou dont, you wont get the eIusive katsu-sand !
Nice, isnt it.Its aIready soId out.
What ?
Yeah, isnt it nicer to have a quiet taIk by ourseIves ?
I thoughtI ordered iced tea.
I did, didnt I ?
What now ?
No, not entireIy.
Guess its not goodto drink aIcohoI.
But that wasthe onIy time.
It was niceto meet you.
I can choosethe girI, right ?
Ayukawa stiII acts so coId in front of everybody.
I was thinking THIS !
Me ?
But why is he mad ?
ModeI, eh ?
The photographer
that was supposed to take this job and a modeI were...
I want to see you as you were born,
But I never thought youd be with Madoka.

How can I not worry ?
What ?You know her, Kyosuke ?
The sea !
Manami, over there.
Wait !
I was reaIIy Iucky to find her, as weII as that Hikaru girI.
I guess I messed up.
Cant do it.
Say, Madoka, whatabout this one ?
Yeah. She disappeared whiIe
She might get moIested !
Better find herbefore its too Iate.
Manami, Iets go.
You go with Kurumi !
Hey, where didyou take Kurumi to ?!
What the heIIare you taIking about ?
Ayukawa is incredibIe.
Anyway, I cant even think ofwhere Kurumi couId have been taken.
TheyII find Kurumi for sure.
So this is the Lovers Forest.
Listen, were checking everybody that comes into the park.
''Why dont we go somewhere more fun ?
Can you get the cat off ?
Say, do you wantsome more to drink ?
ShouIdnt we Iook whereits more crowded ?

Hikaru heard about it and got so excited !
Thank you.
That was a surprising phone call.
That's true, it is Madoka. l'll call her tonight.
Kyosuke... what's wrong ?
Thanks, but l have to make a call.
l think about Ayukawa calling that man, and l... l...
See you later !
That's right,about 5 o'clock.
Not anymore.
But l knew l had to tell her.
Umao,wherefore art thou, Umao ?
Damn it.
l was so surprised when he showed up all of a sudden.
She asked me to do everything, even though it's her wedding.
lfthe day ever comes...
93...
98...
100
Madoka.
But then, are there visiting daysin jr. high schooI over there ?
It was obvious to me that her face was a IittIe different
And a common mistake in this Iine is the direction ofthe inequaIity.
Review the Iast Iesson for detaiIs.
And I... I...
Oh, come on. Its my speciaI Iunch. Let me treat you.
Wait, what is this ?
Good Iuck.
Yeah, since I countedthe steps. Since then...
Were no good ataduIt situations, are we ?
that has nurtured you to a heaIthy youth..
the experience with the students. Right, Kasuga ?
Bozo. AII voIunteer activitiesare put on your record.
Favorite coIor ? What do you wear to bed ?
Its me, Hikaru.
But I wonder whyHikaru changed ?
Wherefore art thou, Umao ?
Dont teII Kurumi or Manami.
You know the kindof movie, dont you ?
The animated''Snow White, right ?
Hes hopeIess.
A man ?!
Yeah, ifyou dont mind.
There you are.
Going somewhere ?
Papa wiII surebe surprised.
Oh, hes so cute !
DarIing has finaIIyasked me out.
I wiII destroy aII men whodare to approach Hikaru !
...get on the beat.Good-bye.
Dont worry, nothing changes.
Dont run !
Its because of him that you became Iike that !
Then...
And besides...
We cant seeeach other...
The girIs are trying out thetechniques on each other in schooI.
I dont know...
Wha...No way.
Im not Iying. Its true, I teII you ! I want to Iearn karate !
Youre Iying,youre a Iiar !
Were you thinkingsomething dirty ?
Its okay.
Kasuga is what ?
Strange ?I dont think so.
Like Kasuga right now.
Im not a wimp...the worst...
Looks Iike hes fine.
I toId you no, so no !
Oh, if its okay, canI heIp set up the dispIay ?!
I mean, if he reaIIy Ioves me, he wouIdnt mind others seeing...
Today, he was ashamedand toId me to stop it.
Thank you !!
You two are reaIIyfighting, arent you ?
You reaIIy want to make up with her, right ?
But it was rightin the face !
No, no probIem !
I want it !
Thank you.
Senpai ! Madoka cantcome and heIp !
Something is definiteIy strange.
So concerned...
They stiII seemto be fighting.
But their angryfaces are cute, too.
Maybe you shouId take more pictures of peopIe.
Maybe nudes...!
DarIing, which one is better, the photo or the reaI one ?
May I have aword with you ?
Idiot.Its the same.
So I wascaIIing about...
I understand.
Which is better ?
I...
Yeah...
WeII...
Just between us ?
Lots of curiosity !
From Hikarus mouth,the rumor spread Iike wiIdfire.
What ?! Kasuga and Ayukawa saw a UFO and took a ride on it ?
An aIien and Ayukawawent on a date ?
I dont beIieve it.
But ?
I think I madea mistake.
I thought she was quiet for a whiIe. Then she makes up a big Iie Iike that.
She sure is theaIien of cIass 3-A.
Besides, theres no way Madoka wouId Iie !
You reaIIy didntsee a UFO ?
Ifthats a Iie... !
No buts !
Use ofthe Powerin the house...
Is okay, right ?
Ayukawa...
...isnt here.
Then Iets fIymore UFOs !
But, it was onIy meantto be a joke.
Kurumi, knock it off !
Come on.
Master, Im borrowing your bike !
Then, Iets get going !
Its just that thinking what I saw with you was just a haIIucination...
FinaIIy, the Iong-awaited summer vacation is here !
Yes, Kasuga residence.
So, I ended up here.
Do I
Do I Iook aII right
Hikaru in a swimsuit was more than Id ever imagined !
Dont even think about doing anything funny to Hikaru !
Yeah.
Where did you come from ?!
No, er...
Today, Iets do up to the Pythagorean theorem on page 17.
Bad shot !
HEY, HATTA !
why dont you quit being a watch dog and come into the pooI ?
I just came backfrom the 2nd fIoor.
I was in the back section.
DarIing...
Fireworks festivaI ?

If onIy Madoka were here, too.
I wish we couIdaII go together.
After ?

PIease dont stareat me Iike that.
Anyway, DarIing, iftheyre haIf price,
Nothing !
...your tears as they faII into the sky.
Wimp !

But there are toomany mountain pictures.
How annoying...
But its not fair that big brother gets to go to the beach by himseIf !
Hey, Kurumi,stop joking around !
Things Iike monsters or ghosts....

Wow, I didnt knowyou were here !
Thats true, isnt it.
Her name is Koto.

Youre right !
...the tide was so strong that we Iost sight of Hikarus boat.
I didnt need anassistant, though.
Brother wiII be surprised when we drop by suddenIy.

It was hard to beIieve my heart kept beating.
I wonder...if Hikaru and Yusaku are aII right.
Hey ! Dont do that, Ayukawa !
Wait !
Come on, come on,push hard.
Hey, Yusaku !Youre getting there !
Hey !Isnt that Hikaru ?
...you Ieapt...
But I wonder iftheyre reaIIy okay ?

Umao !Wherefore art thou, Umao ?
Next !
Here we go.
Right ?
This doesnt Iook good ?
I thought Id be withyou in ''C cIass.
Im sorry, itjust worked out this way by accident.
Kurumi and Manami arewith us in ''C cIass !
Each group, A, B, and C,wiII be separated.
BeautifuI.

Im in troubIe.
No way to expIain it was a prank by Kurumi.
Oh ?
Thiss, er...
Have you seen DarIing ?
Like this ?
Want to practicesome tennis too ?
Are you stiII mad ?
Ifyou want, why dont we go for a waIk ?
Right then, Id compIeteIy forgotten about Hikaru...

Im going home to sIeep.Im exhausted.
Yes, at the Abcb, right ?
Ayukawa.
DarIing, how crueI ofyou to have found out about her.
By the way,DarIing,Madoka wants to see you.
Thats right.
Even Ayukawa does it.Even Ayukawa does it.
So,that was it.She waspracticing in a band.
Scorching tears for you.
But hes Ietting you go.
Ive made up my mind, then !
Do you thinkthis is a hamburger ?
Komatsu ?
This is Iike forcing someoneto draw a joker...
WeII, he has Hikarufor a girIfriend.
And the femaIe anchor ?
Me and you ?

No, III neverforgive you !
Just Ieave it to us.
I couId use my Power,but I think...

Who is he ?DarIing, he was grabbing me !
You dont Iook famiIiar...

At Ieast you havent caused any troubIe IateIy. Be a good girI, cutie.
At that moment, in the worId of six years ago...
Ayukawa Madoka...
AIright.
Youre worthy ofyour reputation. The secret gang Ieader ofthe Kyouryou SchooI.
Grandpa, where areKyosuke and Madoka ?
SheII be here soon,and tickIe my nose...
...am living the best years of my youth!
An encounter is like a highway junction...
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
60, 61, 62, 63, 64...
That makes it just about a hundred steps in all.
Wh...? Whoa!
Huh?!
Okay, then let's make it... 99 12 steps!
Yahoo!
That's more like it!
You ran 100 meters in 3 seconds!
Yup!
Uh-huh, it's pretty nice to look at people this way.
Well, if people get suspicious, we'll have to move again, and I'd rather not.
What if you got lost out there?!
Same to you, Oniichan!
Awesome!
Kurumi!
Ciao!
What just happened?!
Damn you! You'll regret this!
...and, so, starting today, you have a new classmate: Kasuga Kyosuke.
What?
Her bust size is 80... and her hip size is, lemme see...
Oh, damn... Ah...
By the way...
Even now she's playing hooky. Cutting class, y'know.
You've got some nerve.
Shit! h
Yeah, she did it! h
...when I... with Hikaru, a freshman...
Next time: "A Little Lemony Kiss for Her."
You're lying! You know the truth, don't you, Manami?!
Why you! You little big-mouthed raccoon!
Tsk-tsk!alphaHFF No-no!
Hmph! It'd be awful if I got slapped again!
It's all right...
Lemme see... According to last year's data, her breast size is 78 cm!
C'mon! Go for it!
Fine! I'll show ya...
Oh!
If... If I could win the game...
I got it! I got it!
Oh, no, you don't!
Wh...What the...?
Kasuga! Y...You...
...not only has a filthy mouth...
"Leave without me -- Madoka"
Hmph! Oh, well, enough for today.
Why, you! How dare you?! You good-for-nothing!
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
To top it off, I promised to go out on a date!
Sayin' that you desire tenderness over a caress...
Ta-da! Here we are!
Th...That outfit...
Thank you, sirs. Please be seated upstairs.
1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, 3, 4...
1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, 3...
Eh...?
Oh!
Huh? What's what?
Y...Yeah, of course!
...or from when it's just the two of us...
Yeah! Okay, okay! Y'all are one happenin' bunch, boys and girls!
Let's face it! Whatever happens, happens, you're on your own!
Huh?! Oh! Well... no.
Oh, yes! He did promise!
That's too bad.
Kasuga! What's going on?
Komatsu! Hatta! Why aren't you eating? This is really great!
Excuse me, may I get another mixed pizza, please?!
Oh... er... Do you come to the park often?
...or so it seemed to me...
Plankton.
Be sure to wash it before you return it to me.
Ayukawa! Please believe me!
"A"  Kissing. "B"  Petting. "C"  Sex. "D"  Pregnancy!
As one encounter led to a double romance...
Jingoro... water... water...
I wonder who that is? Dad should be working tonight.
Oh, c'mon, Kurumi, you're lying!
...Hikaru coming from the direction of Kasuga's apartment this morning!
You don't look like much... but, man, you're a STUD!
I, for one, believe that Jr. High students shouldn't be doing such things.
So you don't like me after all, Sempai...?
H...Hold on!
Ayukawa! It's all a big misunderstanding...
I'm not lying! It's the truth!
Why, you...
Oniichan?
...but we were only chatting and drinking coffee!
Why are you even bothering to tell me this?!
Kasuga-Sempai, what are your feelings towards Madoka?
You seem to regard Ayukawa very highly.
"My son didn't take it away from her!"
I can take you to a really awesome place!
Yo, girlfriend, stop lookin' mean like that! Hang out with us!
Get lost!
See you later! Bye-bye!
Stop right there!
Kasuga!
Just then, I wanted to... tell her that I had heard Hikaru's story...
I don't know why exactly...
...not saying anything at all.
Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment.
A...Ayukawa was seen... with a middle-aged man...
...played gentle melodies.
An encounter is like a highway junction...
Ushiko!
Here! This way!
Go for it, guy! rGreenYeah, man!
Huh?!
"l... I saw something that I was most definitely not supposed to see!"
S...S...Sure!
What?! You're not going?!
"It's true that she came over to my house...
"Well? Which one do you like? This one...? Or, this one?"
Wa...
Kinda rude to ask that of a young girl just before her school break, don't you think?
A...And last night?!
I wonder if that dinner at the hotel... was an advance on my pay?
I don't know how to reply to that, Madoka!
It happened so suddenly that... truthfully speaking, I'm not sure what to do.
Sure.
"Right? Right, Hatta?"
I bet that's just what's going to happen!
Sure.
Undeniably...
Are you okay?
...even though it may seem trivial... I... felt like I'd somehow touched it.
Ayukawa jokes?!
This had to be the first time... that I got to see Ayukawa like this!
Maybe not...
With Hikaru...
Just for tonight... can you let me stay over?
I won't tell... Hikaru about it...
Yahoo! I'm back!
We're home! rGreenWe're home!
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
This Hino Yuusaku, or whatever he said his name was...
Didn't you know that was my breakfast?
I'm Hino Yuusaku.
"Her?" He couldn't have meant...
...and have a private study session...
You're so lame!
What a bogus pun! You're the one who's even more lame!
Besides, your teaching style is very good, so...
I bet that I'd do really well on the exam, if you do!
Hello!
A-ha... Even you study for exams, eh, Ayukawa!
What do you mean, "even" me?!
Oh... Thank you very much.
What...?! How can you be studying impossible stuff like this?!
Sempai, I hope that we can do this again tomorrow.
I was just trying to make a joke!
Con-cen-tra-tion!
This is a freshman-level question!
Mnemonic: 1.7320508  hi-to-na-mi- ni-o-go-re-ya  "go treat people"
The square root of 3 is 1.7320508...
...it's clear that I'll become completely exhausted.
It was... a scent that was most mesmerizingly wonderful.
Kasuga?
He's still looking at me!
It's to prepare for the exam, you know.
Hikaru...
Oh... after school? I've got a previous engagement...
A previous engagement, eh?
Oh, yes. Thank you. Good luck to you too, Madoka.
Aha... Hikaru too, huh?
You bathed together...?! Ow!
Ayukawa...
"Why don't we take a bath?"
Look... it's the day before the exam! Knock it off already!
Hmm... since he was little, eh?
Okay?! rWhiteI have to s...study for the exam tomorrow!
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Yikes! S...Sorry!
You're very welcome.
"...if she finds out that I've been tutoring you...
Since when did you get so sweet, Madoka?
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'...
Oh, Hikaru!
What do you mean "Cool?!"
Er... no! Not really.
...you should try to make her steer clear of Ayukawa a bit.
She was into a lot of degenerate stuff, supposedly!
Just like this room! Yup!
"Say..."
Kasuga!
Master said that something came up, so it's closed for the day.
Oh, er, well, now that the exams are over...
And, then... there's THAT... and THAT... and THAT!
Come on!
What's up with her?
...feeling how I looked like a pathetic little brat...
...having gotten upset about something so trivial.
Gosh, where's Oniichan?!
Are you all right?
I'm not some kid who gets drunk after having 5 or 6 baby drinks, I tell you!
Obviously, you're used to doing all sorts of "fun" things.
The truth is, I didn't really mean that.
Oh, shit...
You better get ready, or you'll be late for school!
Yikes...!
Ayukawa!
But, you know... Well... how do I put it? Oh, I know!
Well, why not go somewhere where we can be alone and talk quietly?
I'll be waiting for you at ABCB!
Oh? I thought I ordered an iced tea.
Huh? Oh, right...
That hurts!
Here you go! Say "Ahh!"
What happened, I mean.
W...Well, it's not the only thing to blame, but... how can I put it...
But, that was the only time...
Love is deja vu; an unfamiliar memory. I feel our lips pressing together.
Love me... tenderly... Golden Summer Mirage...
Someday... Someday... Please let my body feel your lips...
I'm at the beach right now.
"Night of Summer Side"
Sayin' that you desire a caress over loneliness...
"Night of Summer Side"
Do we have guests...?
I'll contact your agency later about my decision.
Yes, we just finished, as a matter of fact.
P...Professional models, like they say...
Hey, all! This here is all my "Award Winning" stuff!
This one is Nakamura, from 1-A!
Come with me for a second!
Ready, Set...
No! It wasn't an audition or anything like that, Madoka!
"Th... This guy?!"
Haha! See, it all happened yesterday.
...get more and more exaggerated.
Oh, gosh... If I had nothing planned, I'd help you out, but I'm busy today.
Well, Kurumi and Manami can help out a bit, but I need some "manpower."
Dammit... Those bozos!
Howdy!
I'm tellin' ya, Kasuga... Really, don't mind us! You should take it easy.
Oh? Oh! Oh! Er... Well...
Uh-huh!
Oh! Why, same here!
Th... This time for sure, it's the perfect chance, Hatta!
Yup!
A... Ayukawa...
Oh, please excuse me.
Huh?
What?!
Dad!
Oh, sure! It's pretty good! It's the best!
What a goofball! Really...
As one encounter led to a double romance...
Sayin' that you desire tenderness over a caress...
Kurumi, I'll Teach You How To Date.
Why, you... Kurumi!
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
Pl...Please let me help you too!
He looked like a sex-maniac, wore sunglasses...
Manami, let's go look for her! You go with Kurumi!
Yeah...
Do you know?
I don't know of anyone...
Sabu... You don't have to do this.
Huh? O...Oh!
Cherry Street?!
Sabu, take care of everyone, okay?
Thanks...
...I guess this is the kind of a place that he meant.
Now it's kind of embarrassing... to come in here.
What?!
"...placing your hand around her waist."
I... I'm sorry, sir!
What the...!
...and then, lemmesee... a large Corn Soup for Jingoro!
Oh, no!
What are you doing? O... Oh! Nothing!
I... I mean, a fun place!
Sabu!
Sheesh! After all the trouble I went through, we end up here!
Kurumi!
Huh? Hmm... If we stay here, she might happen by.
B... Bro!
Lemmesee, cutlet-sandwich, and all kinds of stuff!
What?! Hikaru's at the hospital?!
Darling!
I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart...
"I... I... finally realized..."
"Oh!"
Still, you shouldn't dismiss your dreams so quickly.
Oh, Dad, c...come on!
Oh, you're so over-the-top, Hikaru...
H...H...Hey... Hikaru...
Wh...Whoa! Don't look!
A...Ayukawa!
This is the last time we're going to tell you that these characters spell "Ayukawa."
YES!
Don't kill yourself so soon!
H...Hey...
Hikaru!
Gimme them!
Hey, you! Today's the day Kurumi and Manami get Cutlet-Sandwiches!
Yeah!
Hikaru left...?! Get your hands off me!
Yes...?
C'mon! How long will it take?!
...I mean, your stomach!
Hikaru...
"Of course it's the truth!"
Gee... A slow day?
Kaboom! Boom! Boom! I did it!
Oh...
Anyway, let's get out of here!
Yeah.
"Burger World"
Hikaru! Hikaru!
Oh, Darling...
What?! Kurumi, you told her about it?! rGreenYup!
I see...
W...Wait, Yuu! What in the world are you doing?!
Same here!
But, in addition to that, if I catch a glimpse of a guy...
I... can't calm down.
As one encounter led to a double romance...
"Take me to Summer Side"
...the way you avoided me, usin' that naive look, wasn't so innocent.
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
...Japan and America were at war early in the Showa era.
"Huh?"
"It's got nothing to do with kids."
It was a shocking phone call...
"A...Ayukawa?"
At that moment... Ayukawa seemed so joyful.
...she was not only the object of his love...
"Ayukawa? She didn't come in today."
Oh, c'mon! What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?
Oh... Sorry.
"Ayukawa!"
"Stop... Stop!"
For three days, Ayukawa was with that man. Which means...
That was then, but this is different.
Th...Th...This...
Kurumi! Would you go out with me?
Try to understand! Time is running out for us!
That means... only a year until Ayukawa can...
So, I'm begging you to give her this! Please, Kasuga!
C'mon! C'mon!
 The fork! The fork!
Yes... All right? We'll go to the ceremonial hall from there.
Oh? Did somebody die?
Here you go.
What's wrong?
I couldn't do anything...
It doesn't matter... anymore...
Ushiko, wherefore art thou, Ushiko?
Oh! Oh...
Shit!
Ayukawa!
All of a sudden, there he was! Talk about a surprise!
Someday... Someday... Please let my body feel your lips...
It turns out that Ayukawa's parents are internationally-famous musicians!
...the way you avoided me, usin' that naive look, wasn't so innocent.
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
...I learned that Ayukawa's parents are internationally-famous violinists.
No way!
At times I look back at the past out of loneliness.
I can see a great crowd at the promenade; People all accompanied by happiness.
The tenderness you shared with me...
I'll even be able to stop by at your school every so often, huh?
"You bastards... I won't let you get away with this!"
I see... Yuusaku...
That day, Ayukawa didn't even try to look at me once.
Oui! Oui!
Kurumi and I have promised to help out!
And, we're gonna make the other girls in our classroom help out too!
Okay, then! "For what we are about to receive!"
Everyone, together like this, eating. Even tomorrow...
"So, I..."
Mrs. A said she'd just vanished, without doing any packing.
Oh, c'mon, Kasuga!
Did you really think that I'd be going to America for good?!
N...No way!
At any rate... Ayukawa's decision to stay...
...and makes you crazy about me.
...played gentle melodies.
...at least in principle...
...something sensational happened!
Would you get that?
Say, say... Could you look this way a BIT?! Say, you!
Wh...Which classroom are you in? What's your name?
Sempai!
What?! Papa will never let you hear the end of it.
Wherefore art thou, Umao?
Yuusaku, have you seen Sempai around?
"Of course!"
Indeed! Indeed!
Thank you!
No, I have to get going.
So, where are you going?
1... 2... 1... 2...
...'til they beg for mercy! Yeah!
Kyosuke!
At last, I've made Darling ask me out!
Any man who dares to approach you shall be instantly vanquished!
"Some man must've gotten her all stimulated!"
"What?! Stimulated?! What kind of stimulation?!"
"Between a man and a woman... There's only U-KNOW-WHAT!"
...so that's why I...
You'd better be able to feed them!
Yuusaku!
Oh, c'mon, you don't have to say it!
...I don't think it's really me that you like!
...very cute.
Love me... tenderly... Golden Summer Mirage...
Next time: "A Foreboding Dream! Madoka and Kyosuke Breaking Up At Last!"
You slammed the door, evadin' the shadows that followed...
Sayin' that you desire tenderness over a caress...
C'mon! C'mon! What's the matter with you?!
Oh! Go for it!
Oh, Umao! Wherefore art thou, Umao?
These girls want to turn pro?
"Oh! Oh, gawd, Oniichan!"
"Well? Well? Father Dearest?"
"Ahh... Fine! Fine!"
"l love you, 'my father!' "
Ha! "As soon as they see the training..."
Dad, you're crazy!
Er... No... Not really...
W... Wait! Wh... What the...
Then why do you wanna learn karate all of a sudden?!
W...Will you let me explain?
I promise I'll support you!
Hey, H... Hatta!
Right! Left! Right! Left!
Don't need it! Right! Left...
Every boy will always be a Tom Sawyer. They're what curiosity is all about.Strange, I thought "Tom Sawyer" was a questionable localization here, but after checking on the DVD, it's actually in the audio.
"Don't overexert yourself!"
"Kasuga!"
Oh! Komatsu asked me if he could put it in here, in case it rains.
"Say what? You want to challenge ME?!
"l wanna find out how much I've learned... you know."
"Sempai..."
You wouldn't want Kasuga to see you looking like this.
Uh-huh.
Go for it! Go for it!
Oh, my! My girls!
Busted! rGreenBusted!
Oh! Er... Oh! I... er...
Huh?!
He told you guys not to use the Power, didn't he?
The two were able to get reunited at the banks of the Milky Way...
"You're the worst!"
No can do. Why not leave it...?
Love is deja vu; an unfamiliar memory. I feel our lips pressing together.
Love me... tenderly... Golden Summer Mirage...
Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment.
...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe.
I've fallen in love with you - that I realized...
...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent.
Wherefore art thou, Ushiko?
What's the story?! What's with all the noise, so early in the morning?!
Kurumi, take off the socks!
What do you think you're doing?! Okay, Kurumi, gimme back mine too!
Egad!
As Dad's exhibition opens tomorrow...
I think so.
Oh, no! Tell me it isn't so!
We certainly can! Let's leave it to "Model-student Manami!"
Say, want me to talk to Manami, so you guys can make up?
Hey! Who the hell...?!
What's going on?
H...Hikaru!
Oh! N... N... NO!
You gotta watch out, okay?!
Madoka...
No problem.
Sure! Sure, a reception...
There you have it. I promised to help out here.
I'm sorry that I made you lie.
Why, you...
You can tell me the truth, you know that!
Huh? Ayukawa said that?!
We are out at the moment.
"Kasuga Takashi's 7th Solo Exhibition: Midst of a Journey - I was young then."
Love me... tenderly... Golden Summer Mirage...
...on that morning I'll be called your lover.
Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me!
Come over here.
You're going to town again today?
Oh no, you're not.
But you're staying home today.
Okay, I'll be heading out now.
Takeo...
There, there.
There, there.
there's always...
I've been accused of breaking this plate!
You see?
Come on. Get back here.
That's why you should never stroll around at night.
and say, "You don't have to be scared. There are no demons. You're safe."
a demon!
Nezuko's a man-eating demon?
You suffered, didn't you?
Nezuko!
A sword?
That's how man-eating demons multiply.
Please!
Please!
Why did you show your back to me?
I know you're devastated.
your family might not have ended up dead.
you can't protect your sister or heal her...
This kid...
Long ago,
it will kill and devour even its own parents or siblings.
I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
Tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent you.
I won't let you die!
Your big brother is definitely gonna save you, you hear?
Your face is all covered in soot.
It might get dangerous if it starts snowing, so it's fine to just stay home.
Well, I want everyone to eat their fill on New Year's,
But Mom!
I promise I'll help you!
All right, I'll be heading out now.
There, there.
I told you to cut it out!
Hey, Tanjirou!
I've got a good nose, so I'll be fine.
what are the demons like?
If you're done eating, sleep. You can set off at dawn.
i1Saburo has been all alone after losing his family.
Be careful, okay?
i1Keep moving forward!
i1Oh no!
I'll carry you to town, okay?
i1a demon!
She's my younger sister!
Once you turn into a demon, you can never return to being a human.
Please!
You fool!
i1and, simultaneously, tossed the axe into the air.
Go see an old man named Urokodaki Sakonji who lives at the foot of Mt. Sagiri.
Tell him that Tomioka Giyuu sent you.
She's gone!
Nezuko...
I want to keep moving during the day as well.
Nezuko?
See that? The bleeding's stopped already.
The same trick won't work a second time.
All right, time to snap your neck.
i1Sh-She ended up killing him!
My hair got all tangled up while I was wrapping it around this axe!
Nezuko!
i1If I don't finish him off, he'll end up killing people again.
You won't be able to finish him off with that.
i1I didn't hear his footsteps!
i1Giyuu...
i1Is my body dead, then?
I can't go to you, so you come to me!
i1No wonder Nezuko shrinks from it!
I'm Urokodaki Sakonji.
I suppose you're the one Tomioka Giyuu sent my way.
You're simply too slow at making tough decisions.
Do you know why you couldn't answer my question right away?
It's because your resolve is too weak.
Kill your sister!
Get your sister ready and follow me.
i1You've always had to bear with everything.
i1The air's thin here!
i1I'm gonna make it back no matter what!
i1Nezuko!
I accept you as my student,
Whether or not you may participate in the Final Selection is up to me.
i1Well, I say today, but Ive been doing this pretty much every day recently.
i1After my daily routine, I practice swinging my sword until my arms nearly fall off.
i1and I charge at Master Urokodaki with full intent to kill.
Wrong!
This?
Get in there!
Nezuko!
i1Ill wake up to find her dead.
i1My descents keep getting more dangerous,
I have nothing more to teach you.
Dont give in, Tanjirou! You can do it!
Im stronger than you.
Even more!
Pound it into the marrow of your bones!
Ive been trying every single day!
I just cant go any further!
Theres no other way but forward!
i1Shes so cute.
i1I dont think I got any of that.
At the end of the day, I dont think theres anything else you can do.
i1Sabito was wielding a real sword.
i1When I had finally beaten him
i1Sabito was smiling.
I heard thats because demons used to make fun of his face for looking too kind.
i1When Im fighting against someone,
i1The thread is connected from my blade to my opponents opening,
Ill take good care of her.
Say hello to Sabito and Makomo for me!
However, they don't grow from this point onward, thus there will be demons abound.OG: However, wisteria doesnt grow from this point onward, and thus there are demons abound.
i1Wheres it coming from?
Its been ages since I last had human flesh!
The swords wielded by the Demon Slayers were forged with a special kind of steel.
i1Water Breathing, Second Form!
Time has passed into a new period?!
Thirteen.
The more powerful one was a brat with an unusual hair color.
The other brat was a girl that wore a floral kimono.
Im familiar with the designs Urokadaki carves.
Theyre all here inside my belly.
Her deftness turned into recklessness, making her much easier to deal with.
I ripped her apart, limb by limb, and then...
Then again, even that pink-haired brat couldnt slice off my head!
i1No worries. My neck is tough! He cant slash through it!
Youre hopeless, you know?
i1You can rest easy now.
i1my soul would make it back there, too.
i1But there were at least twenty.
Tsuchinoe.
Are you kidding me?
Are you done chatting?
i1Theyre asking us to choose,
I think that Nezukos not like the other demons.
Im just taking a guess here,
Theyre used to produce steel that absorbs sunlight.
Its black, huh?
Is that bad? Is it not supposed to turn black?
No, not necessarily.
How old do you think you are?!
It can talk?
My first assignment...
Forget about that!
Id like to explain a few things to you.
Since so little is known about them,
I dont know how well Ill do as a Demon Slayer,
Get in, will you?
If you dont mind, Id like to hear your story.
Dear!
They are active during the night.
Its gotta be somewhere nearby.
i1The spot where the scent is strongest...
i1is right here!
Ive got two more questions for you!
i1It can probably emerge from anywhere.
i1Here he comes!
i1Fifth Form!
i1Eighth Form!
i1About Kibutsuji Muzan
i1Not deep enough!
i1And I cant take a full swing while guarding others!
If I dont devour her soon, shes just gonna keep losing flavor by the second!
Thanks!
It didnt break even after it got kicked from the inside.
Nezuko!
i1Are these the belongings of the people who were kidnapped?
Theres hardly any air inside this swamp.
You shouldve looked before you leaped in, you damn fool!
i1But...
i1All right!
Hands off my sister!
You smell like rancid oil.
Listen here!
Start talking!
I cant tell you!
How could I be all right?
Youre just a kid!
Im sorry!
No can do!
Ive never been to a place like this.
i1Kibutsuji Muzan!
You appear to be quite flustered.
i1They smell like humans!
Oh, you think so?
You need to worry about yourself!
Kibutsuji Muzan!
I cant!
Please!
Move!
Bewitching Blood.
And youre trying to save him.
and I wish to annihilate that man, Kibutsuji.And I wish to obliterate Kibutsuji.
Never been better!Im fine! Im fine!
It looks like youll drop dead at any second!You look like youre about to fall over dead!
Do I look like Im dying?about to die?
Those earrings...
Ill have two, please!Id like two bowls of udon!
I couldve just tracked you by scent.
i1Nezuko?
Sorry.
I never introduced myself, did I?
My name is Tamayo.
Of course, we never take so much that it harms them.Of course, no more than would impair them.
i1I see.
i1If blood is all they need, then Nezuko...
Youre right.
Just how old are you exactly, Miss Tamayo?Exactly how old are you, Miss Tamayo?
I always ask them beforehand if they wish to live on even as demons.
i1The scent shes giving off is pure and devoid of deception.
I can see.
And ones carrying some kind of big box.
Yushirou...
It wont be easy to extract blood from such demons.
Get down!
Did you decide how to kill them?
A building just appeared out of thin air!
And is the demon hunter accompanied by a demon?
Lady Tamayo!
Understood!
The demon hunter wearing hanafuda earrings...
i1Seventh Form!
i1However...
La
I despise them with all my heart!
Twelve Blood Moons?
They serve directly under Kibutsuji!
i1If I were to cast my Arts now, it would affect Tanjirou, as well.
This is fun!
I have two favors to ask of you.  made consistent
Third Form!
but I wont allow you to do anything that displeases our lord!same here with the referal
If those two really are from the Twelve Blood Moons,
then theyre undeniably more formidable than any other demon youve slain up to this point!
Understood!
Nezuko!
Now then, why dont you two die together?
You get rid of that arrow man first!
Im counting on you.
This medicine will help heal your leg right away, all right?
i1My sword feels so heavy!
i1I did it!
i1and I cant swing my sword!
Its still not enough yet!
Wh-Whats wrong?
Look at her.
Lady Tamayo...
I used a healing serum made exclusively for demons on her.
What the hell did you say?
Shut up!
Theres no way hes that petty!
Not Lord Kibutsuji!
Im going to take care of Nezuko.
Not for a second!
Heres your mari.
Play with me.
Nezuko!
I moved her to this basement, where the sunlight won't reach her, ahead of daybreak.
Family?
But Nezuko has perceived you two as humans.
Thank you!
i1If this goes on, you will most likely succumb to your illness.
but I believe it will be less dangerous than taking her into battle.
Never again.
Please! Please! Please!
Not that I was really trying to or anything.
First, its time for a Taisho secret!
The Demon Slayers messengers, the Kasugai Crows, each have their own name.
Nezuko?
Wait there for a second!
Seems like yesterday that she was tiny.
Try not to lose your way!
This is my turf.
You won't get me twice!
Sh-She killed him!
Oh, but wait! He's a demon, so...
He's actually talking!
Stop it!
Okay!
H-How can I finish him off?
And, like earlier,
I'll make sure to take care of your sister for you.
It's way thinner here than on the mountain where I used to live!
I'm gonna make it back no matter what!
Tanjiro Kamado.
Which do you want for dinner? Nikujaga or oden?
I want oden!
Wh-Whats up with that?
Youre all I have!
All I did was speak to you!
What was your reason for picking up the sword, Zenitsu? OG: becoming a swordsman
Why are you acting so blatantly shameless?
Would you like this?
Start running! Start running!
You smell something?
Something Ive never smelled before.
Please tell me.
This...
And they went inside that house, right?
Did you two follow them here?
We followed the traces of his blood.
Tanjirou...
Sound?
Even though... I got out...
Am I still gonna die?
is this man your...
i1Forgive me. Forgive me.
Even if something happens, you two will be safe.
Dont go breaking any bones on me, you hear?!
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
If you yell and the bad guy hears you, it wont end pretty!
Come on, lets set foot outside!
Wha
Are you trying to run away by yourself?
Because this isnt something us kids can resolve on our own!
Youre kidding me, kidding me, kidding me!
What are you talking about?
Next, Episode 12, "The Boar Bares Its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps"!
Here goes...
Teruko!
My swords will hurt you.
Knock it off! Theres a demon right there, you know!
Okay.
Excuse me, Zenitsu.
G-G-G-Give me a signal first!
If that had come to pass, that wouldve made you a murderer for sure!
Just leave me behind, okay?
i1But if I dont protect him...
Whats up with him?
Please wake up!
i1Hes giving off a different vibe!
Thunder Breathing First Form!
What the hell? I cant take this anymore!
Shouichi...
Thank you! You saved my life!
Lets get going, okay?
Making my way through a cramped building like this...
Kyougai.
Ive come to defeat the evil demons.
a-and I nearly got eaten.
another monster showed up out of nowhere,
A-And then,
And when I picked it up and struck it,
Rareblood!
Listen to me, Teruko.
Ill follow your scent.
Good!
Im heading out.
So infuriating!
I have what it takes!
or any time in the future!
Even if Im broken...
Im the eldest son, so I can endure it!
You think so too?!
i1I can fight!
i1Your head...
i1Just give it up, will you?
i1Ninth Form!
was incredible?
However...
I cant forgive you for killing others.
i1It extracted the blood.
Your writing is just so boring.
Tanjirou...
The drum vanished, so we panicked.
Whats wrong?
Take this!
i1Ive...
...itsu! Zenitsu!
When the room spun around, we got thrown outside.
Im glad to hear that.
I can tell from his voice!
Get out of the way!
Oh, hey, come on!
i1Tanjirou, despite being a Demon Slayer, is traveling with a demon.
You wont draw your blade even after all that bravado, you dumbass?
Ill just have to skewer you along with that box!
Knock it off!
the more potent and troublesome their Blood Art becomes... no maybe he just says it
I wonder if I really have a chance of beating them.
Now, its time for a Taisho secret!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
If thats the case, well settle this with fisticuffs.
Actually, isnt Tanjirou violating the rules, too?
Itll just get worse!
Nothing can top the pleasure of this moment!
You should really start thinking hard about the future! jet: this line might be staying on-screen for too long?
calm down a bit!
I-Im not!
I dont know how to read or write!
Sorry for asking too much of you!
Youre better off not looking at him.
Cant you see Shouichi doesnt want to stay?
We can get home on our own.
Thats fine. Sleep wherever you want.
If youre gonna be like that, were gonna stop eating together with you.
Why are you traveling with a demon?
You really shouldnt heap so much praise on me!
And how strong...
I havent forgiven you for stopping me from having Shouichi tag along.
i1Come to think of it, what did it take to make him mad?
Even youll do, Inosuke!
Z-Zenitsu?
Youve been traveling with a girl this cute?
and youve been on cloud nine the whole time, huh?
Tales of the Demon Slayer Academy!
Yes, sir!
Ta-n-ji-rou!
Zenitsu! Stop chasing us! I beg you!
Oh, dont be like that, Tanjirou!
an8Stop!
an8Zenitsu!
Tanjirou!
Pardon me, sir.
Theyre pleasant to the touch and quite comfortable.
i1Geez, this guy is totally clueless.
I wont be beaten!
Hold up!
Zenitsu? Whats wrong?
Ill go on ahead.
What the hell is this?
As you wish!
i1Would you really leave your friend by the roadside?
i1I wouldve gone, okay?
i1Sure I would.
Youre not cute at all! I mean it! Not that side of you!
I mean, look at how cute Nezuko is! And shes a demon!
But youre a sparrow, and youre so vicious!
Dont bring a young girl into danger!
What is that sound?
Theyre not moving normally!
Theyre alive!
i1Its being carried here by the wind!
i1Hes standing on the threads!
Mother will kill you all right away.
Shut up already, Mr. Forehead!
I wont let anyone get in our way.
No one can break our bond.
Whoops-a-daisy!
Tanjirou!
Spatial Awareness!
 Im just gonna demolish them all at once!
Ill find a way to hold them off!
Lets go, Inosuke!
Hey, let go of me, dammit!
The closer you get to me,
the thicker these threads are, and the stronger my marionettes become.
Dont tell your father! Just not him!
Hold up! Weve got to find a way to help him!
i1To stop them from moving...
My bad! I kind of missed it!
Where are you, Tanjirou, Inosuke?
Inosuke, launch yourself off me!
i1if I die, Ill be released.
i1It feels like Im being showered by a gentle rain.
i1Ill be released.
After all this time, you still cant get my name right.
Totally wrong!
Ninety-nine percent there!
Dont go showering me with your sensitivity and kindness!
You hear me? Got that?
i1Huge!
Youre already losing anyway.
What are you talking about?
i1Get a hold of yourself!
Hell no! Im sure Ill die if I do any more training! Not Hell no instead of oh no. Oh Yeah, no.
Although, maybe all you wanted to do was to train a swordsman!
I do feel terrible about the fact that Im like this!
i1I was struck by lightning.
Im doing everything I can, okay?
i1Whats up with this guy?
Oh, crap! Dont climb up here!
Its all right to cry.
But dont ever give up!
i1Get out of my sight.
Dont play dumb. jet: "Don't play dumb."? Mostly for CPS purposes
i1Hed drag me right back.
i1Did I get sliced?
i1Im powerful.
i1Anytime.
Was that a lightning strike?
Who are you calling father?
Isnt the moon lovely?
Wont you be a bit more chummy with me?
All right. Lets split up here, then.
Dont come anywhere near my family!
Water Breathing!
Whats going on?
Whatever you do, dont die!
i1Dont give up!
i1Dont
Yoo-hoo!
Allies?
You...
You can just back off!You care to back off?
The higher your rank, the bigger your paycheck, after all. Since you get more money from the top guys the higher you rank up.
My units practically may have been wiped out,
i1Im sorry, Inosuke.
i1How do you slash through someone whos sword-proof?
What the hell am I doing?!What the hell kind of attitude is that?
After ripping you to shreds, Ill carve you up.
Ill do you a favor and kill you at once.
Damn you!
Hes trembling with fear and dread at the sight of me, huh?
i1Theres no point.
No way in hell am I gonna lose!
i1Take this!
i1Im sorry, Inosuke.
I saw you using the same technique as Monjirou! You his friend?
i1No way...
And now Im gonna beat you! Thats how it works!
I cant hear you!
i1The threads this boy is controlling...
W-Wait a second!
None of you ever managed to fulfill the roles bestowed upon you.
Once youve done that, I will forgive you for what just happened.
Boy, lets have a chat.
Not to mention, Nezukos not aNezuko isnt some kind of item you can freely trade around.
i1What should I do?
Cease that hollering.
Im sure Im mistaken, but...
i1S-So strong.
i1Youll play right into his hands!
Did she pass out?
so to ward off injuries and disasters,
If you can master the correct way to breathe,
Did I actually defeat a Blood Moon?
No one will ever sever The bond between Nezuko and me
between us!severed by anyone!
i1My father saved me!
It wasOnly me and my threads caught fire.
of lowlifes always getting in my way!
Its just a kid.
If we let it go, itll devour humans!
Ill do better, Rui!
How disappointing.
What the!?
Do you release those threads from the palms of your hands?
The moon is quite lovely tonight, dont you think?
Is that so?
Fourteen humans.
Oh! Pardon me!
Just barely!
Im a pharmaceuticals expert!
Staple food... Humans!
Their physical prowess is remarkable. Wounds heal in the blink of an eye.
and, once lost, their limbs don't grow back!
to protect other humans.
991!
Nezuko...
And I'm going to teach you all ten of the Water Breathing forms.
Wrong!
Nezuko! I am water!
I practiced over and over what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki.
I gotta do more!
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
I'm training.
So, you think you're actually going to injure me!
Well, you have absolutely nothing to worry about!
because I've sliced that boulder!
Particularly, the breathing technique Mr. Urokodaki taught you...
I'm trying!
What a strike that was!
Both he and I love Mr. Urokodaki very much.
See, Total Concentration Breathing accelerates your blood circulation
and your heart rate.
How can I do that?
Sabito was gone.
Why does Mr. Urokodaki wear a mask?
Rui!
Rui!
i1I was never able to run.
i1Even walking was a struggle.
i1Because now that I had acquired a strong body,
Rui!
i1All my mother did was sob,
Take pride in your strength.
i1who could shield me.
i1the less I remembered about being a human.
i1It was simply out of my reach,
i1no matter how I strained to get my hands on it.
Father...
But as for those for whom being a demon meant despair,
Because demons were once human too!
Please step off of him!
Why would you get in my way, Tomioka?
All right, Tomioka,
Im not...
Im not disliked by people.
Y-Youre mistaken!
Tomioka...
Isnt that against the Demon Slayers rules?
i1Ive got to get as far away as I can!
i1But why?
This is your final warning.
Are you perhaps still angry that I pointed out how people dont like you?
Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle!
Is it a human?
Oh hey, this is a mask! Hes a human!
Whys he strung up like this?
They wrapped us up like mummies.
Can you at least answer me please?
Or are you perhaps still angry that I pointed out how people dont like you?
...do like me?
that remains a mystery.
and each of them trains their pupils with their own regimen in their location.
I can't stop getting ensnared in all the traps!
After descending the mountain, I swing my sword until my arms nearly fall off.
500 more!
And he added, "If you ever damage the blade, in other words, break it,
I wield my sword,
Next, he told me to become one with the water.
I'll wake up to find her dead.
and the air's even thinner where I train.
If you can slice this boulder,
I practiced over and over what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki.
The basics like holding the breath and flexibility...
I was glad I had written those down in my journal.
But...
I felt frustrated.
Immature.
But you have a wooden sword, and I have a real sword!
Well, you have absolutely nothing to worry about!
Total Concentration Breathing.
Slam it into your flesh!
She speaks in such an abstract, dreamy way.
I'm not sure I get that.
How can I do that?
I just couldn't beat Sabito.
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!
Sabito, Makomo and Mr. Urokodaki!
Bummer. I heard he was a Demon Slayer with a demon in tow,
Wh-Who are these peop
an8Don't open your mouth just yet, you moron!
an9FLAME HASHIRA KYOJURO RENGOKU
Don't you have anything to say, Tomioka?
and when I got home, they were all dead!
You know what we call that?
an8A total delusion, you moron!
Hashira or not, I won't let you get away with it!
Is that right? Good for you!
Damn you!
You little...
an8- The Master... - The Master...
I wonder if the sky is blue.
i1This...i0
an8I apologize for startling you all.
since I'm going to forget anyway.
an8Because of her resilient mental strength,
Kibutsuji has sent pursuers after Tanjiro.
now that Kibutsuji's given himself away for the first time, I don't want to let go.
an8We have to go into the shadows, or the demon won't show its face.
an8Nezuko!
Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me!
Your face is covered in soot.
Well, I want everyone to eat their fill on New Year's,
Since he can't use the cart today,
And Hanako, I'll read for you when I'm back.
Be safe, okay?
And everyone follows you wherever you go.
I told you it wasn't me!
Are you gonna go back to the mountain?
I've got a great sense of smell, so I'll be fine.
These demons wouldn't come inside your house, would they?
since way back when.
Nezuko!
Nezuko...
She's my younger sister!
That's probably the one who killed my family!
It wasn't Nezuko!
Please don't do it!
Don't ever give others a chance to murder you!
Can a weakling who can't take the initiative in such a situation heal his sister?!
No, it's all right. You can have the bamboo and straw for free, too.
I said it's okay! You're one hardheaded kid!
EPISODE 2: TRAINER UROKODAKI SAKONJI
Nezuko...
I'll carry you, okay?
People have gone missing lately!
Try not to lose your way!
should heal in no time.
I'm gonna snap your neck!
Nezuko!
i1Giyuu...i0
I can't go to you, so you come to me!
Are you listening, you brat?
O-Oh, that's right.
I'm Urokodaki Sakonji.
I'm counting on you, sir.
i1Rocks?!i0
Now, it's time for a Taishou secret!
Yes?
What's the matter, demon? Come on!
You know you want it.
Poor soul...
Tanjiro...
Go out and defeat a Twelve Kizuki.
Nezuko and I will do it for sure!
- We beg your pardon! - We beg your pardon, Master!
A Tsuguko is a swordsman trained by a Hashira.
Didn't we already explain it to you numerous times?
Zenitsu!
Tanjiro! Listen to me, will you?
an8I don't know about anyone named Murata,
Hey, you're right!
Nezuko...
They're all risking their lives for us.
The Master more or less saved both your life and mine.
Oh, right.
an8I'm hurting, and this is tough,
an8I'll become an old guy and die.
The more the human population increases,
He may have the power to draw them!
I believe that among you Hashiras who are present today,
an8My children,
Let's go.
Demons.
No one knows when and where they first appeared.
Even so, they battle the demons...
Relax your upper body
Nezuko! I am water!
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
Bring it on!
It was really beautiful!
I could never imagine I'd be able to cut a boulder like that.
But that goes for demons, too.
It's called a "warding mask."
All right! Thank you very much!
I'll be going, then, Urokodaki-san!
Tanjirou...
How do you...
an8However, there is no wisteria from this point on,
From above?
Taishou?
The era!!
The number of Urokodaki's disciples I've eaten, that's what.
an8I know the style of the masks Urokodaki carved.
They're all here inside my belly.
When I said that to the girl, she was crying and fell into a rage.
He may lose, and yet, he may win.
an8That Tanjirou...
What? Sabito was cooler than me?
Next, Episode 5, "My Own Steel"!
Nii-chan, where are you?
God...
Even if I survive now, I'm gonna die in the end anyway.
Kanoe.
Don't give me that crap!
As many as five of them managed to survive, huh?
how to turn a demon back into a human.
These produce steel that can absorb sunlight.
A clown mask?
No, not necessarily.
Night after night,
as a Demon Hunter!
Kasugai Crow, say hello to everyone.
I don't take orders from you!
Next, Episode 6, "Swordsman Accompanying a Demon"!
Right.
It's that strong?
So little, in fact, that
I don't know how I'll do in the Demon Slayer Corps,
Right.
One more thing.
Because he was with Satoko-chan when she was taken.
Night after night... It's so creepy.
Kazumi-san!
You may not believe me.
I believe you, all right!
Those things are active during the night.
I just hope they're all right.
Satoko?
Don't chase after him!
Nezuko!
I'm going underground!
I want you to protect those two!
You can do that, right?
an8Talk to me!
I can't tell you!
A kid like you?
an8I hope you'll find something of Satoko-san's in there.
I'm sorry!
It's way too crowded.
i1He's...i0
Mother!
Now I feel kind of grown-up!
Dear?
an8Please don't do that!
Aroma of Visual Fantasy.
I am...
All right. You be a good girl now.
Aniki, let's hit one more bar!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
What the hell, you bastard?
You piss me off!
Yacchan!
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
an8The human body is unable to withstand such transformation speed.
As you wish.
an8I'd like a bowl of udon!
I could've tracked you by scent.
i1Eyesore?i0
i1Eyesore?i0
Hurry it up.
Come in.
I have returned.
I'm sorry that I left you to take care of things just now.
Isn't treating human wounds unbearable for you?
Come this way.
Blood?
but what I do is buy blood
Two...
Yushiro!
or those so gravely injured that they don't have long to live.
I can see footprints.
Yes, ma'am!
it is necessary to study the blood of numerous demons.
I have two favors to ask of you.
i1Nezuko...i0
It won't be easy to extract blood from such demons.
an8and create this medicine...
I hear that he churns out seven to ten pages a day.
Did you decide how to kill them?
So careless.
Oh, stop whining!
Twelve Demon Moons?
Until your life ends!
So don't worry!
If you look at the arrows, you can tell which direction they're going!
Nezuko!
Take care of the demon up in the tree!
Third Form, Dance of the Swift Current!
Are these two demons closely related to Kibutsuji?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
then have at it!
Watch your back!
Don't let your guard down for a second!
You get rid of that arrow man first!
Waterfall Jar!
i1Twist!i0
Those are some powerful demons!
i1Twist!i0
Shoving my face into this vile dirt!
an8You're going down with me!
an8More...
Unbelievable.
There's no one stronger than him!
I'm begging you! Please! Please forgive me!
Don't go inhaling Tamayo-sama's spell!
It's harmful to the human body!
You got that?
If Tamayo-sama says so, there's no mistake.
She got exactly what she deserved.
I hope this blood will be instrumental in developing the healing serum.
I don't want to leave Tamayo-sama's side!
Over here! Over here!
Not that you need to come at all.
Nezuko?
an8Cut it out!
when I interact with humans as a doctor,
The young and the elderly are particularly perceptive.
Tamayo-san, thank you so much for your concern.
Let's go, Nezuko.
South-southeast! South-southeast!
Next, Episode 11, "Drum House"!
TO BE CONTINUED
You're that guy from the Final Selection!
an8Because she's in love with me, all ri
You were crumpled up on the side of the road looking ill, and all I did was speak to you!
an8I already have a fianc, so not on your life!
Stop that!
Listen up! I'm going to die soon!
You gotta protect me until I manage to get married, all right?
What do you mean, save you?
It was so bad that I thought I'd be better off dead!
I'm so scared! Scared! Scared! Scared!
My brains are gonna get sucked through my ears while I'm still alive!
Please save me!
Hey, thanks.
Thanks!
So he says.
You can understand bird language?
I can smell blood.
It didn't give us a glance.
And they went inside that house, right?
Did you two follow them here?
We followed the traces of his blood.
We're going to defeat the bad guy and rescue your brother!
Are you all right?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
Our brother's wearing a persimmon-colored kimono.
But no one else can help them now but you and me.
an8Is that so?
an8I understand.
I-I-I'm gonna die!
Teruko!
Teruko, you gotta try not to scream.
Thanks to them, he got away!
Pig assault! Pig assault!
Infuriating!
Pig...
Teruko!
Stop launching those reckless assaults!
an8You damn insects running amok in my house!
My swords will hurt you.
Just stay behind me.
Wh-What's the matter?
an8that would've made you a murderer for sure! Do you get that?
Even still... Even still...
That's why...
I think it would be best to be as quiet as possible! Right?
an8A demon showed up! A demon showed up, understand?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
How will I know until I have a taste?
Zenitsu-san! Get up!
No.
You seem to be a pretty fresh human.
an8and serve as my springboard!
That way...
I've had enough.
That's your limit, and you've reached it.
I've come to defeat evil demons.
And I somehow held on until now!
You little brats!
The more scarce the blood,
I'm leaving this room now.
Right now, your brother is terribly exhausted.
I'll call out your names when I open the door.
I'm the eldest son, so I can endure it!
Thanks, Nezuko!
TO BE CONTINUED
Is that you, Kocho?
It sounds like a difficult mission,
Kocho, what's your plan taking in that head-butting kid?
Nooooo!
an8What's the matter with him?
There's only so much gross a person can take!
I was summoned to the Hashira Meeting to give my report on the Mt. Natagumo incident.
Then, let's have you start your Rehabilitation Training, shall we?
an7TWO WEEKS LATER
Sorry.
You miserable bastards!
They smell so nice when they pass by, and it's mad fun just to look at them!
an8Oh please, I've stomped on female kids before!
I win!
an8Ouch!
i1But...i0
Thank you for a good workout.
Um...
Sorry! I didn't hear you.
do you maintain the Total Concentration Breathing state around the clock?
but I should do it around the clock, huh?
Isn't it about time you came to training, Inosuke?
an8Sulking and feeling sorry for yourself won't do you any good.
For me, that was a good job!
You spineless fool!
Blow into these gourds?
Oh, really?
What? You mean this?
Nezuko's existence has been officially acknowledged,
an8My dream that we can become friends with the demons.
It might be true that I'm in a constant state of anger.
Ever since my beloved big sister was slaughtered by a demon.
Every time I see the tears of those who've lost their loved ones to a demon,
If there's a way not to kill these pitiful demons,
I've done a good job until now!
EPISODE 13: SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE
Where are you, Tanjirou?
What the heck? All right, all right, just stop giving me that look!
Let's go this way!
an8Damn! This is so annoying!
I'm not handing over Kiyoshi... the rare blood to you!
an8Out of my sight!
Boy...
I see.
Tanjirou-san...
Take this!
Am I gonna...
I'm Agatsuma Zenitsu!
This is Tanjirou's
an8I've known that from the very start!
So gentle, I've never heard anything like it before.
Take this!
He did break his bones.
Knock it off when you've got busted bones!
an8What the hell?
Nope, I'm done!
What's the matter?
Amazing! Can I touch your head?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
My name's not "you"!
You sure it's okay to rest?
Ke-ke-ke.
What?
Sorry to bother you so late at night!
She's so quick, it's eerie! She's a monster!
an8Use your chopsticks.
an8Here.
Severe!
This bump hurts more than my ribs.
It really hurt, you know.
Getting pounded to a pulp like that.
If you're gonna be like that, we're not eating with you anymore.
According to the crow,
but I never thought they'd show us this much hospitality.
so we competed to see who was stronger, and I seized his sword.
It's out!
Purged immediately!
an7COMBINED JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL!! TALES OF A DEMON SLAYER ACADEMY
an7NO PIERCINGS
Button your shirt.
Nezuko!
Man, I'm hungry.
Those clothes of yours are quite soiled, I see.
Hey, wait up!
Now then, for good luck.
an8Wait up!
Hold up!
Still, what good will it do to just sit there?
What a pain!
We've come for backup.
- As you wish! - As you wish!
an8Don't you agree, Tomioka-san?
You don't understand a thing about humans, do you?
They're not moving normally!
It's Murata!
Murata-san!
You want me to find where that demon's at, right?
No one can break our bond.
Nezuko-chan!
Next, Episode 16,
"Letting Someone Else Go First."
Dammit!
Murata-san?
an8I never pissed my pants, you stupid boar!
I'll find a way to hold them off!
Let's go, Inosuke!
what the hell are these annoying threads?
P-Please kill me!
Hey, why are you running around in circles like that?
Wha...
They're all such useless dolls!
Nezuko-chan! Where are you?
Chuuntarou?
Check it out! I've tossed up more than you!
an8This way! I'm gonna catch up to 'em soon!
Don't just leave me here all by myself in this terrifying forest!
You're in my way!
From above?
Wait!
A genuine member of the Twelve Demon Moons...
Yeah, but I know what it is that you can't do, Inosuke.
You're 99 percent there!
Got that, Tanjirou?
Hold on! Inosuke!
Before you know it,
my head will be harder than yours!
an8If this can just be a dream, I promise to do my best!
It's no use running away.
What are you talking about?
an8Chuuntarou...
an8Did lightning just strike?
Tales of a Demon Slayer Academy!
Nezuko-chan!
Isn't the Moon lovely?
I'm only here to slay some demons.
Don't come near my family!
Not to mention, the bleeding's making me stumble!
L-Look out!
My unit's practically been wiped out,
Come on.
an8Until...
an8Until he gets back,
What doesn't hurt doesn't hurt!
Now that it's come to this,
In your dreams!
D-Did it just shed its skin?
Hey!
TO BE CONTINUED
an8It's all good! Everyone's still alive!
an8R-Rui?
Yet, she stays by his side.
W-Wait.
If you do that, I'll forgive you for what just happened.
Come on out.
an8But now the only thing left for you is death by my hand.
an8It would be sad if it were to come to pass, right?
I'll teach her what will happen if she defies me.
an8I've had enough of this crazy talk!
Unless you fix that basic misunderstanding,
an8The way I see it,
What is your role?
What a fool you are.
If she still doesn't learn to be docile,
an8You have no chance against me.
You're making too much noise.
Enough of that infernal wailing.
You still don't realize how futile it is?
i1I'm...i0
I cut off my head myself with my own threads...
an8I'll kill both you and your sister.
i1Lull.i0
We finally drove her into a corner!
an8I'll do anything!
Welcome.
Tomorrow, Rui is going to be summoned by that person and descend the mountain.
Sh-Shouldn't we make a run for it?
Whaaa...
And then, it'll be your turn.
How amazing!
an8The west, my dear.
In that spot alone, I counted at least fourteen cocoons.
i1Frolic.i0
Careless of me!
Are you all right?
an8Siblings!
Nezuko!
All right, I'm gonna shoot up the ranks with a special sword, too!
TO BE CONTINUED
Father...
Rui...
It was all...
You're...
Oh my...
an8everyone hates you, you know.
an8please move out of the way.
an8Tanjirou, dressed in a checkered haori,
an8Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle!
Tanjirou, dressed in a checkered haori, with a scar on his forehead!
I feel bad about tying him up.
an8Wake up.
Or are you perhaps still angry that I pointed out how people hate you?
Apparently, Kochou can't stand cats or dogs or any kind of furry creature.
- I am... - "...not hated."
Any answer but that one please.
an8Wake the hell up, will you?
Wh-Who are these peop
Before we start the trial,
Pillars...
Let's put him out of his misery.
Tomioka's just as guilty of breaking the Corps rules.
What I'm more interested in is hearing this boy's story.
I'd like to hear the explanation from the boy himself.
You've injured your jaw, so please drink slowly.
I became a swordsman so that Nezuko could be cured!
Um...
Shouldn't we at least wait until he arrives?
She can fight as a Demon Slayer to protect humans!
Please, would you mind putting down that box?
an8What did you say about that demon, kid?
an8That she can fight as a Demon Slayer to protect humans?
Pillar or not, I won't let you get away with it!
an8- ...has arrived. - ...has arrived.
about this swordsman, Kamado Tanjirou, accompanied by a demon?
an8The Demon Slayer Corps' mission is to annihilate demons.
an8We can't guarantee that she won't attack humans.
an8That said...
an8Where did this take place?
Did you battle him?
an8I also believe something's happening to Nezuko that Kibutsuji never saw coming.
It's unacceptable!
Come on out, demon!
Look, it's the human blood you love so much!
PREVIEW
Naho! Kiyo! Sumi!
Very well!
I did it!
your basic stamina level will skyrocket.
When that rattles your blood, your bones and muscles will go, "Boom! Boom!" You gotta stop it!
Don't mess with me, or I swear I'll rip off your breasts!
Yes, ma'am!
More! More! Boom! Boom! Boom!
You're doing great! Keep it up!
Right now! Harder! Bam! That's it! You can do it, Zenitsu!
That's Mr. Haganezuka's scent!
You've got a lot a nerve!
Yeah!
There's something I wanted to ask you.
What would that be?
it's not Fire Breathing.
an8"Flame Breathing" must never be referred to as "Fire Breathing."
Right.
You think so, too, Nezuko?
I know!
if you use any breathing techniques while your lungs are being squeezed,
Such a weak, pathetic child.
an9DESTROY
So now, it's been proven that Nezuko won't attack humans, right?
Tanjirou...
and they've also defeated Twelve Demon Moons.
That is why Pillars receive respect and preferential treatment.
You may step back.
All right, then! Take them away please!
Hold on a second!
We assure you that this boy will be severely reprimanded, so
I just heard him mention Tamayo-san's name!
Don't you say another word!
- I'll never forgive you as long as I live! - I'll never forgive you!
- Apologize! - Apologize! Apologize!
Someone's here.
It's the girl from the Final Selection.
Hey, somebody's forgotten how they got stomped on by Kanao-sama last night.
We were ordered to come here by Kochou-sama.
an8I gotta take this five times? A day?
I mean it's really bitter! It's such an ordeal!
an8What's gonna happen if I forget to take it? Hey! Hey! Hey!
And that girl's been yelling at me all this time! I hate my life!
an8I've got nothing to do with this.
an8I'm so sorry! I couldn't rescue you!
Paper! Paper! Do something about this!
an8Your voice...
What's going on?
Oyakata-sama more or less saved both your life and mine.
We'll have to bolster the ranks of the Demon Slayers.
I believe that among you Pillars who are present today,
Could it be the Twelve Demon Moons?
It sounds like a difficult mission,
Be careful.
Take your medicine this second!
an3DESTROY
Are you all right?
But it tastes so gross!
an8Functional Recovery Training?
Yes!
How did it go today?
Now!
That's it!
Last up, full-body training.
In simpler terms, you'll be playing tag.
Come on!
an8How can you say such a thing?
Snap!
Please train me well!
I shall take you on.
Please train me!
Here's a towel for you.
an8Hey, Kakushi lady over there!
Good idea! And also...
Blow into these gourds?
So, you make some kind of sound?
Gigantic!
I'll bring them tomorrow.
Hello there!
Don't you feel lonely all by yourself?
Yes.
You're right.
Every time I see the tears of those who've lost their loved ones to a demon,
How can you feel sorry for something that's killed humans?
then I must carry it on.
Tanjirou-kun, please do all that you can.
Nothing escapes your nose, does it, Tanjirou-kun? That's amazing!
Well, it doesn't matter to me.
It broke!
Yeah!
What Tanjirou-kun is trying to master is a skill called "Full Focus, Constant."
an8Even though there's no reason you can't do it?
Kanao, you're in the same class, so why don't you join them?
Haganezuka-san!
Long time no see!
The dull sheen of that indigo-gray hue is so cool.
an8Unbelievable! He's unbelievable!
an6SENSE OF REASON
Either way, it's the same thing!
Okay! Looks like your jaw is as good as new.
So, I'm done with my training?
A-Actually, this is something that happened during my childhood.
All I can tell you is that while Breath of Flame does exist,
Right.
And I'm still doing Full Focus, Constant right now.
I know!
is actually great for healing exhaustion and wounds.
Next, Episode 26, "New Mission."
Your record is now ten wins and ten losses.
Why is it that you demons in the Lower Moons are so utterly weak?
Are you more afraid of the demon hunters than you are of me?
I'll put my own life on the line to fight for you!
I can still be of use to you!
How long a reprieve are you asking for, specifically?
I'm never mistaken about anything.
I'll give you even more of my blood.
The casualties of the Infinite Train are increasing.
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
All right! Look after me if I get hurt again, okay?
Hey! There you are!
We're heading out now.
TAILS
There's no need for you to thank me.
What was that you just flipped?
I flip this to decide what I haven't been ordered to do.
"Don't speak" was heads, and "Speak" was tails.
So, your heart can grow as strong as you want it to!
We'll do our best!
I told you not to eat it now!
Shut up!
Are you heading into battle now?
You should keep at it.
Right!
Take care, you guys!
I can stay behind if you want!
The master of this land! The ruler of this land!
even if we explained about the demons, and it would only confuse them.
an7DEMON SLAYER INFINITE TRAIN ARC
Look at them go!
You mean while doing Total Concentration, Constant?
Yeah.
That's nothin'!
an7LOWER THREE
You shouldn't be satisfied with just being counted among the Twelve Kizuki.
That is merely your starting point.
But what about you demons in the Lower Ranks?
No!
an8Do you have any last words?
I just...
If you can kill the demon hunter wearing hanafuda-like earrings,
What's going on?
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
Tanjiro has a pure soul and is capable of striving hard on a daily basis.
an8Ah...
but perhaps Rengoku, the Flame Pillar, might be able to provide some guidance.
Take care!
Thanks to you, we can go back into battle!
Are you heading into battle now?
Right.
Hey... Hey! Hey!
What the hell is this creature?
an8See how long it is? So intimidating! No mistake!
A railway train, all right?
Comin' through!
We should go, too!
Ryosuke...
Master, we should go.
I'd like to settle the score for these children
are on the front lines even as we speak, fighting the demons.
No matter how many lives the demons take...
Tanjiro! Inosuke!
Delicious!
A mission?
Well, I'm glad to hear it!
Thunder.
For real?
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.
I'm gonna run outside and race to see who's faster!
That's dangerous.
tickets, please?
D-Don't leave me behind!
First come, first served!
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!
All human hearts are the same.
This way!
Just leave it to me!
Neither you...
Was father pleased to hear your news?
Senjuro is even worse off.
I'm going to be honest.
Father wasn't happy to hear it.
Keep that burning passion inside your heart!
Looking good.
It's burning up.
I've never seen a red one before.
Wow!
an3I like them, too!
Nezuko, let's go.
Big Sis went up the mountain to pick vegetables.
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.
Wake up!
It's a dream!
This is a dream!
I see... That's right, I'm...
No, you don't! You stop it right now!
I have to wake up...
an1Big Bro!
If none of this had happened...
I should be here making charcoal every day
if none of this had happened
Big Bro!
We can't be together anymore.
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?
There are lots of things to thank you for.
What's with this realm of the subconscious?
I'm so going to kill you.
They're having trouble, aren't they?
Tanjiro...
Nezuko...
Inosuke...
This smell... The ticket!
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!
Rengoku
Is a demon controlling her?
What do you think you're doing?
You want to stay inside a happy dream, don't you?
But it was warm...
No way!
Be careful.
The smell is overpowering!
What? You're awake?
It was him!
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?
the spell activates,
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams, for self-serving dreams...
It's not working. But why not?
This brat...
How could you be the only one to survive?
All these people packing this train from one end to another...
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!
It's so cramped!
What happened?
Young Kamado!
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!
Five cars, all by himself?
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot! Do what you have to do!
Somehow...
Even if I fall under it, I can break the spell!
Hurry!
Inosuke, protect the passen...
I can't die.
I can't die!
Cool, huh?
Is your stomach okay?
I'm...
all right.
save the injured...
Zenitsu...
I was held at bay!
the same demons have remained for the last few centuries.
That's it. Stanch it. Stop the bleeding.
Great! Looks like you've stopped it.
There are hordes of injured people, but no one's life is in danger.
Thank you very much.
That's a fine sword.
What would you and I have to talk about?
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.
And no one ever took me up on my offer, either.
while you're still young and strong.
When he strikes the air with his fist, the attack will reach me here!
and these breathtaking sword skills will be lost, too...
Blazing Universe!
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...
I...
He stopped it?
I can't...
Pierce!
And besides, the battle's already been decided!
You bastard!
He's stronger!
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!
No.
that I want him to take care of himself.
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.
and my duties?
I can't believe he's gone.
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon really show up?
I'm so frustrated!
Don't cry even if you have regrets!
I don't believe it.
I'm not sad.
Hideki...
who died while I'm in charge.
Sorry! We're very sorry!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.
It's my sister Nezuko.
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura that I'd seen as a child.
On top of that, I hear that they have no clue which style to master.
You never know when a demon might appear.
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!
Thank you...
very much.
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?
I had a hard time detecting you.
There's still one more.
You will not lay a finger on that man!
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!
I'm begging you.
Their slumber will grow deeper in a little while.
Hang on until everything's ready to go...
while you count.
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.
What a weirdo!
I can make these really great-looking ones...
All right, let's go! Showdown!
an7Roger that, Boss!
Oh, right.
So what if you've become a Hashira?
Brother...
He was a passionate man.
And Senjuro...
Close call. He's right there.
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!
The spiritual core!
I've never seen a red one before.
Wow!
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one who likes rice crackers!
Um...
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!
Little by little.
I have to go.
Where are you going, Big Bro?
I wish I could turn around and go back,
If none of this had happened...
So, please...
And that creepy naked boar...
Seriously, this is insane.
All right, then... Die!
I wonder why.
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!
Rengoku
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.
And yet...
how did this one manage to wake up?
get away with this!
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!
Tenth Form...
Why didn't you save us?
How could you be the only one to survive?
It should've been you that died.
How dare you go on living without a care.
my family!
Or was this demon weaker than him?
Protect the sleeping passengers!
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!
I'll save every last one of you guys!
It's gone this far already?
And then, after all your strength is depleted...
Sixfold.
I'll protect you...
Is Zenitsu awake now?
It's so cramped!
How could this be?
But there's no time to lose! I'll keep it short!
I'll protect the five in the rear.
You and the boar head boy...
Somehow...
That's right!
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...
It's regenerating so fast!
I have to sever it!
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.
Wake up!
Hurry!
Don't die such lame deaths!
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!
H-Hey, is your belly okay?
I can't die.
Hang in there!
I'm...
Help him, will you?
Because my minion asked me to!
Get your breathing under control.
save the injured...
before it's too late.
You have to believe!
Did I lose? Am I going to die?
It was him!
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!
In the Upper Ranks...
Make your nerves reach every corner of your body.
Concentrate harder!
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.
What's he doing here and now?
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.
It's close to the realm of the highest.
Let me tell you why you can't enter the realm of the highest.
Because you're a human.
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.
This boy isn't weak!
Why do you think that is?
As a fellow martial artist, I just don't get it.
while you're still young and strong.
Air Type!
I see.
Nice moves!
I'll pass!
Magnificent! That's sensational!
I can't jump in.
Fourth Form...
Kyojuro!
Flame Breathing...
I see hi
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.
You must never use that God-given strength to hurt others or for personal gain.
It is the duty of those born strong to help the weak.
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!
I have to kill him and get out of here!
I can't...
The sun's coming up!
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!
He didn't let anybody die!
You should go to my parents' home,
to follow his heart...
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...
I can't believe he's gone.
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon really show up?
Was it that strong? I mean...
Get over here! We're gonna train!
in the land of the dead.
Rengoku!
Good morning, Master.
A butler is someone who supports Ojou-sama and everybody from the bottom of his heart!
Right, what the master owns is the master's, and what the butler owns is also the master's.
In other words, I lack the fiery attitude, huh.
Yes? What is it?
Just when we're running off to the city, I have to think of that violent old man!
Sure, we'll be together forever, Ren-chan.
Hato-nee.
We've arrived at Nanahama, the port city full of young people!
He may be my younger brother, but he's so obedient and wonderful.
I don't take live-ins.
It's about time I went back.
I'll never go back to a home like that.
I'll be the one who'll make Hato-nee happy.
You look all pale.
Hey! I'm not radio controlled!
Ah, sorry about that.
Here.
This is pretty impressive.
Seconds!
Maids actually exist, huh.
Your uniform is cute and nice.
Hato-nee's is great, but this is just as good.
No, I don't need it.
This maid made me...
When I get pushed, my spinal reaction acts up.
Sorry, but with that kind of attitude, you'll only trouble your sister.
After I explained our situation, they agreed to hire us as live-ins.
Well, you should have no problems if you do your job normally.
People have to help each other out in times of trouble. That's what you said.
You wouldn't have collapsed from anemia if you didn't try to prove yourself.
Since you're about the same age as Yume and it sounds fun, you're more than welcome!
Shinra comes from shinrabanshou...
Huh?
I guess I don't have a choice then.
Whoa, cute!
ending song
In episode two, Ren is going to transfer to the school of which I'm the student council president.
Well...
I'll make her work like a dog.
What?!
Out of everyone, you fit the image of a maid the most.
Thank you for the meal.
Er, and me?
What did you say to my beloved Ren-chan?
I'll teach you how to tend to it.
Natose-san, Ren-kun, you sure are pumped up.
Stare.
Of course. The dining table is one of the most important spot for verbal communication.
If you don't eat it, you won't grow!
Where I became lost during a sandstorm.
Huh?
Since I received this as a gift, shall we eat it together?
Once you top it with cream...
It's nothing.
Oh, it's you, Ren-kun.
Whoa, the nightscape is pretty!
Yikes, I might be late!
Ow!
M-More?
Hey!
All three of us are on the same track tream and in the same class.
We're always together.
I was assisting an elderly woman at crossing the street.
Yup, he's Uesugi Ren-kun.
Huh?
Good for you, Ren-kun!
You're right. Yummy!
W-W-W-W-W-Wrong... i-i-i-it's out of loyalty.
Morning!
Hello.
Please discipline me.
Huh? Was there a stuffed animal over there?
I guess it was there, or I guess it wasn't.
This incident will be taken into consideration when we pass down the verdict.
Am I... Am I...
Huh?
For now, I command you to be my personal attendant.
Taking care of one's subordinates is part of my elegant duties as a boss.
opening song
But, aren't you looking forward to the flower watching, Haru?
You're dense, Uesugi.
Yes, I'm a dog.
The person that I like is...I'm no boy
T-To be honest...Break it down
What should I do?
In other words, you have to take her where she wants to go.
Now that you mention it, you're right.
Just a little, you know, just a little.
Right.
I'm despaired! Despaired of my robot who turns against his creator!
Don't raise the hurdle.
Such a pitiful master-servant relationship.
Listen to my song!
I get the message, Mommy.
The Kuonji Sisters' Cosplay Show!
Starting off with school uniforms!
Uniforms don't look good on the adult person I am.
She's only kicking the steel pole?
All right, as an encore, I'll show you something else.
You idiot.
I told you not to say such dangerous things!
Thieves!
Such uncouth people to be stealing when people are having fun.
Yes!
Yeah.
That's too bad, because Dad's now here!
Morning, Ren.
Ah, Shinra-sama... please wake up...
Is anything wrong?
Yume, you'll catch a cold.
Yes.
Not only were you quick to learn the job, you were able to discern your masters' tastes and personalities as well.
To this day, he still holds a place in the hearts of the people who knew him.
My dad was a loser who didn't work and who abused me.
an7You talk big.
Ren-kun, take care of Shin Onee-chan.
Shinra-sama?
eyecatch
I'm glad you could make it all the way to Japan!
Maestro, please tell me what you thought about the performance?
I couldn't... perform up to expectations...
If you hold the baton with a face like this, it's bound to make the audience tense.
To think you'd be the one to remind me what I was lacking.
What?
Farewell, Xiaolongbao...
Nice going, Ren!
Shinra-sama, there's ice cream on your nose.
Let's escape this way.
It reminds me of my days at the academy.
Shinra-sama...
Since we're on a date, we might as well savor it.
I won't catch a cold just from this.
All of the burden by yourself.
How the world sees me won't pressure me!
Out of respect for my father and as the daughter to Kuonji Banshou, I made the effort not to embarrass his name.
It seems like you got carried away, kid.
Sorry for the wait.
It's time for my rehearsal. Please hurry.
More than anything else, I'm on your side!
Nee-san, explain why.
Well, I got carried away during my date with Shinra-sama, and made her upset.
Who's going to return to a place like that?
Is that so?
M-Miyu-san.
I... that is...
Yume might not have enough strength to loosen you up.
I guess you need to be a man to do it.
Why are you and Yume going that far?
Nee-san, you should stop acting stubborn and open up.
A wise decision.
You don't have to be uptight. Just do your job as you have in the past.
All this for my sake...
Old man...
I thought you might have forgotten my number, so I have come to pay a visit.
Hato-nee and I won't go back home!
You're forgetting the debt you owe me for raising you!
Ren!
and that you must do things in the way you only can... were they all lies?
I...
"A man must protect a woman"!
This can't be...
I'm no longer a kid who you can order at will.
You're the only lineage I have in this world, you know.
My family is here!
This way, everybody!
Ren-kun, are you all right?
Old man...
That brat sure outdistanced me.
Super Electromagnetic Massage!
I'm sorry for the last minute changes, but...
Shinra-sama, it was a huge successfscx200-
Go for it, Miyu!
Shinra-sama, don't lose!
Well, the usual stuff.
Miyu-tan, slurp, slurp.
What's a butler?
Won't you say it with more loyalty towards your mistress?!
op
Hato-nee, let us two siblings become happy together! TWINCEST
This is a thank you for my kind Ren-chan.
Wow! You're amazing after all!
What's that?
Damn!
I'm Kuonji Miyu.
Kuruppo!
To cut into chase...
Are you saying it's good because of the ingredients?
Why did you kick me out of the blue?!
I'm Uesugi Ren.
Huh?
You're not crumbling away?
Shinra comes from "shinrabanshou."
It means everything that exist in the universe.
Your angry face is cute, too!
Ah, nice to meet you.
These two are pissing me off!
She's cute.
And I'm the Colonel, the legal guardian of my mistresses.
Actually, there'll be a big development.
Shinra-sama, it's morning.
I'll sleep.
You ordered me to wake you up at this time.
In that case!
Say, Hato-nee.
Yes!
We'll be together forever.
Let's split up and find a job.
Heaven on earth, heaven on earth.
She's collapsing.
Hey, miss, are you all right?
I'm not in the age of being called miss anymore.
What are you saying, miss?
My, my, that's wonderful!
Doves are the symbol of peace.
Kuruppo!
Amazing.
Wow! suggeenaG: line starts too early, retime
I hope he grows up well.
This is beef stewed in red wine.
No, B of the bear.
I guess it's because of the ingredients.
You'll get your back booted.
What the hell i-is he?
You're Kuonji...
Shinra.
Not yet...
Huh?
I won't let your injury go in vain.
Where am I?
Oh, Shinra.
You loli, after I went through the trouble to make you wear that hat...sekkaku boushi wo kabusetanoni kono rori
You wouldn't have collapsed from anemia if you hadn't took of your hat.
Hmph!
...call me Shinra-sama.
Your angry face is cute, too!
Hey, stop it!
Ah, everyone has a strong character.
A-Ah, that's right.
H-Hey, Beni, I'm hungry.
Nice to meet you.
What'll happen?
Hato... nee.
I'll make her work like a dog!
Beniko!
Thanks for the meal!
Okay.
Yeah, whatever.
They all bloomed beautifully.
Ah, Ren-kun, would you help me?
Morning, Yume.
Good morning, Mistress.
You're in the way!
I set my eyes on you without noticing it.
Thank you very much.
Miyu-san, aren't you going to school?
Come on, don't say that.
This is yummy.
You saved me, Mihato.
Could it be, that the sight of a pheromone-emitting grown woman gives a boy like you the case of eye cancer?G: tm cowteats, altering from Is it by chance bad for the eyes of a little boy like you, the figure of a grown up woman emitting pheromones?, maybe "gives you the case of eye cancer" or "is poisonous to your eye"
We're inside the house. DO IT FAGGOT!
Um... Er... Well...
You are way too innocent.
Yes, we're connected by this veranda.
Yes!
I'm so beautiful, it's almost a sin.
Good morning, Kei.
We're all in the same class and track team.
O-Oh right, I was on day duty.
Yume, my bosom friend.
This is my charity. Humbly accept it.
As long as I can serve Ageha-sama, I'm more than happy.
Right, my bosom friend, Ren?
M-Morning...
Tomorrow I'll be an official butler of the Kuonji family, huh.
Did you see a ferret?
so everyone is desperately looking for it.
Mistress Yume.
On top of that, a ferret...
Just...
We can't do much to cover it.
I'll continue my job as a butler!
And you, Uesugi Ren,
It's just as I told you.
On you free time, you can be the personal attendant of whoever you want to.
Huh?
For the time being, I command thee to be my personal attendant. yes, thee
I bet you have no clue of music.
You dummy, just wait and see!
Hato-nee!
But with bluffing alone, you can't defeat me!
I too will fight with all my power!
What the hell was that noise?!
Er...
This really suits you.
You're so cool.
You are very pretty too.
Yeah, whatever.
They all bloomed beautifully.
Please have a nice day at work.
For your sake I'll finish it quickly.
I, Kiyohara Chiharu have been moved for the first time since I was born.
Um, Miyu-san, do you feel better now?
Of course.
and became lost in the sandstorm.
Shinra-sama...
For some reason I felt the chills...
Yes.
Let me go!
I found the book Miyu-chan was looking for on the internet.
Not bad.
You saved me, Mihato.
So this is your room, Natose-san.
That aside, the people here have way too unique characters.
Let's put our hearts in it and serve them! arr osund a bit awkward
Ah...
Ah... Your cold gaze...
So this is your school.G: yume is beside him :
Are you sure about this?
She's being artificially fed.
You're late, Kojuurou!
She hit him! shouryuuken!
Since when... did I become... your friend?
I bet it's something like growing your mustache, huh?
It's bedtime for kids.
Good night.
M-Morning...
Come on, hit me! you can use whip me too
Ah, I was the captain again.
I-I...
It was for me.
Yes.
First, Uesugi Mihato,
you passed with flying colors.
Thank you very much!
For the time being, I command thee to be my personal attendant. yes, thee
Huh?
You..
Continue. hai, tsudukete
This car sure seems expensive...
Don't be so nervous.
This is what you call an elegant overtake.
She's even more special on her real performance.
Y-You were watching me?
Hmm?
As I thought, he's worth teasing.
Just kidding.
Miyu-san!
I'm going to capture the flag.
Yu...
Give it back!
My duty is to hold her up, so is it alright if I run away? wut was that some weak ARCHER copy pasta?
I'll be taking the flag back.
Because you hit my stomach, it's...
So you have appeared, Shinra-sama and others.
I won't let anyone go a step further beyond this point.
Don't chase her, Beni.
Wait! You...!
You don't win this game by simply taking the flag.
Good.
Welcome to my recital!
M-Miyu-san?
The winner of Kuonji Flag is...
That difference decided the victor.
You shall remain as my personal attendant.
Oh, that's pretty impressive!
Morning, Myu-tan.
Let's call it a day.
Dump him.
Colonel, is the real estate broker in front of the station
You drank it.
Ren, what were you thinking?
Try talking to onee-chan.
Shinra-sama, may I come in?
We haven't had this festival in a long while.
Since ancient times, flags have played an important role in battles.
Affirmative!
If that's what you say, then I'll get serious, too.
In that case, I'll do my best to make my presence known as well!
Then I'll make use of my obscurity and go scout.
All troops, attack!
Yume!
In doing so, you'll be the key to our victory. well the one doing the crucial move to win
I'll be taking the flag back.
Because you hit my stomach, it's...
I'm sorry...
Probably.
Beni, finish her.
It's my turn at last.
Kuruppo!
T-This is humiliating...
Ren-chan!
Go, Ren!
Ren-chan's so cool!
M-Miyu-san?
Even if it's your order, I won't obey!
Huh? What's this?
Oww!
Stop, you manservant!
Don't get carried away!
Morning, Myu-tan.
You're taking good care of them.
No, he's just going to a southern island for training.
Everyone, please make sure that your passports are valid.
Yay! A trip with everyone!
Items with pandas are my favorite. Isn't that obvious?
Yume, let's play.
Huh?
Sister, I'm an adult! I'm in my twenties!
Give my adult bikini back!
Well then, you are all free now.
What are you talking about?
This is a special butler training center only for those who serve distinguished families.
This is your task for the first stage.
Uesugi Ren.
Run for your life, you hog!
Sir! Yes, Sir!
Ren-chan...
I'm bored.
Just tag along a little more.
Really? Can I order more?
What are you doing?
You're welcome.
D-Did anything happen?
I feel sick!
Miyu-san, stop!
Is that you, Ren?
I won't get tired of you and fire you just because you failed.
Where did you go?
I see.
What?!
If you get serious, the matter will only get more complicated.
ed
There isn't one!!
Huh, prime numbers?
7, 11, 13...
17, 19, 21...
Huh? It isn't?
I can't hear you. Say it out loud.
Yes...
Huh? T-Thank you very much.
That is, if you want to become my personal butler.
And I thought I was immune to older women.
Tell Onee-chan about it.
Hey, Ren-kun, you can't go now...
Ah, it's such a mellow day.
Sorry, Miyu-san.
My soul was infringed.
I'll show you that you can't do as you please, Nee-san!
All troops, attack!
If that's what you say, Yume, then I'm all for it!
I'm going after the flag.
N-No, even if it's Shin Onee-chan, I won't let you pass through!
All right, I've got the flag!
Rest in peace.
By the way, Shinra-sama...
Although you told me to hold fort, is it okay to run away?
I'm not letting you go!
Ren-kun...
I'm sorry.
All that's left is Miyu-tan's flag.
Huh? Do you think you can beat me with a toy like that...
Hey... what?
All that's left is to raise the flag within their goal.
Damn, the imitation egg!
But before that, return my flag.
Flash.
And what you own is Miyu's.
Chuuken, Miyu vertical chop!
Ouch! What a blockhead!
Let's talk about manhood.
To be dragged into bed the second the clock struck midnight...
Shower, shower, shower, shower.
It's really nothing.
Here, cool it down with ice cream.
Then shall we all go together?
I knew you would notice my presence!
Is that something to be happy about?
Yes!
Eh, why is it you...
I wanted to enjoy nature's beauty together with you.
In that case, let's go.
Enjoy yourselves to the fullest.
Sister, can't you show a bit more moderation!
You're naive.
I've brought your tea.
And this is the newcomer of the Kuonji family, right?
Yes, Ageha-sama.
Ren, let's get started.
This is your task for the first stage.
I fully understand that everything in this training will be done at my own risk.
Once your body learns to move naturally with it, you'll be able to serve others better.
You mustn't drop your guard, because there are much more frightening monsters overseas than in Japan.
Silly.
Today, I'm not going to go along with your sexual harassment.
Alright, I'll keep emptying this place!
I'll treat you since I'll keep winning.
Ah, Ageha-san.
299, 300...
My money...
Is that you, Ren?
You don't have the guts to do something like that.
Where did you go?
To where my mistresses are.
Please.
Oh, you have come back.
Huh? What's this?
All right!
Thank you very much.
The reason he progressed so much is
Natose-san always takes care of you...
She hasn't come back since she left with Benisu-san last night.
What?!
No! It's my main story!
You have no right to decline!
I'll be taking them with me.
Now get moving and entertain the customers!
But if you lose...
Don't underestimate the power of money!
They say you can't buy love with money, but that's because you can buy everything else with it!
Seems like the training paid off.
If you do something indecent to Miyu, I'll turn you into Swiss cheese!
Yes.
Doesn't it make you happy to buy good stuff for a low price?
Stop that.
Wanna hang out with me?
So in the end you couldn't pick up anyone, huh?
The one who needs help is actually that dude.
That idiot!
Use your head, you idiot!
Yeah, that's right!
for abducting something like her...
Are you a masochist?
but now you have a family, people you can count on.
We're going to save them.
What's the matter?
Depending on the problem, a specially person like me may be able tocan help.
What idiots.
Huh? Where'd he go?
Begone you filthy-spirited creatures!
Who the hell are you?!
I won't let you lay a finger on my mistress!
Move!
Did you think you could get away unharmed after hurting Ren-chan?
Just like Beniko had her hardships, maybe Natose-san also went through something...
I'll get her.
Are you telling us to dance in those outfits?!
The price is one million dollars.
If you win, they'll be released from their debt.G: changing you to they, talking to Shinra about Beni and Natose
No! S-Stop it,this Mistress Yume!
Go find something you can be proud of.
It's not like that.
Yeah, at the marketplace we met a local girl...
According to her, she had lost her parents, placement check
was forced to work in a restaurant. placement check
She's pretty cute.
Hey, bitch! Did you forget about her?
Don't you feel anxious at being kidnapped?
Don't fuck with us!
Covering for me like that... Were you intending to make me indebted to you?
It just kept trying to destroy me.
I said that I have beautiful eyes, but yours are pretty as well.
Shut up! It's none of your business!
Judging from how your whole body is shivering, it must be your first time doing this. Editor is FAPFAPFAPPING
What idiots.
Then cook me something.
Depending on your skills, I may hire you as a cook.
What should I cook?
What was that voice?
It can't be helped since he was searching for you without any rest or sleep.
Break through it!
Open your eyes for the next KimiAru!
Good morning.
G-Good morning.
Guess I worried for nothing.
Y-Your panties...
I think a clumsy girl is quite a character already.
She'll die if she doesn't have her lunch!
So she fell asleep.
Miss, you should sleep properly in your bed if you're sleepy.
It's just you being too radiant.
I'd do that even without you telling me!
I used my yandere power on the wrong opponent!
Just stop him!k: um...
Will it take long?
Among the three Kuonji sisters... You're the most unique...
In your hands.
Wow, a cute one sure appeared this time. EDIT
It's the same as the commercial! But the sequence wasn't used? TLCCCC
Miss Yume!
Be frank with everyone and we'll all think of a solution together!
So that's how it is, we're pondering how to bring out Miss Yume's personality,
Minor.
In that case... how about acting cuter? Revenant: Added Then... how aobut acting cute?
Well then, I'll show you the proper behavior for a cute girl.
Well, the ball was passed to me so suddenly...
The four punks will demonstrate it to you.
Pink elephant... Hey! Are you making a joke out of an adult like me?
That sounds nice, I'll try that.
She's really good at this.
That's naive of you.
Huh? Salty water is flowing from my eyes...
Haste will only make waste.T: you can change it to literal tl if you want.
Too huge, maybe.
Compared to that hugeness, my troubles are nothing, aren't they?
Fretting is of no use, so I have to relax.
That tranquility is amazing.
Thanks.
You are really...
Nice job, Yume.
No, I...
I'm cute?
What a long phone call.
Good morning.
And with this direct stimulation, furthermore... Aha
That only applies to you!
Huh? What's this notebook?
The world... ah... is going to end.
You're hindering the aesthetics here, so run away.
I thought you were in the midst of getting changed...
You can defeat him... I believe in you...
I'll accept that, but don't you think there's something else you need to do?
Miss Yume!
So that's how it is, we're pondering how to bring out Miss Yume's personality,
You sure are brimming with enthusiasm.
Let's see...
I'm actually very good at picking mushrooms!
In that case... how about acting cuter? Revenant: Added Then... how aobut acting cute?
The crossing sign's red but there are no cars, so I'll just jaywalk!
I can't win at all!
This is my love, a twisted love.
She has to solve it by herself.
I ran out without thinking...
Oh, Haru-kun, you gave me a scare.
Yup, that's right.
Don't be hasty, Yume.
It won't happen in a day, so it's fine to gradually let your personality emerge.
I can't help being anxious.
Too huge, maybe.
What a long phone call.
It's going to be fun...
Stop doing SM play with the sun!
I've also checked thoroughly.
You're so kind.
She'll die if she doesn't have her lunch!
I-If only we had a savior for such times!
Heel kick!
Are you all right?
I'm envious.
I thought you were in the midst of getting changed...
Among the three Kuonji sisters... You're the most unique...
Eat this, monster!
I'll accept that, but don't you think there's something else you need to do?
It's a total victory, V!
If both of you work hard, you can be like me too.
Be frank with everyone and we'll all think of a solution together!
A senseless comedy, you might as well get squashed.
Don't mess with me... I'll turn you into mincemeat.
Nice to meetcha!a bit too early
Well, it's something like that.
But the loli role is already filled by Miyu-san.
Pink elephant... Hey! Are you making a joke out of an adult like me?
But if any of you were to mimic it...
I can't win at all!
Oh my, Yume-san.
You must use a land animal!
She's really good at this.
Well, that's true, but...
That's naive of you.
Actually, I've been around all the while.
Yup, that's right.
Although I'm being envied, I can't seem to be happy at that fact...
Sorry for being a busybody today, I'm really sorry.
The Sun... sure is huge...
Really?
Will Natose-san always be by my side and back me up?
I was only doing what a butler should.
I see, if that's the case...
What a long phone call.
Next episode, The Kuonji Family is Annihilated!? The Visitor Was Ageha-sama!
Go dash after her!
N-No... Spare me...
I'm envious.
With the power of Ambrosia, here comes my Sure-Kill Valkyrie Boots!lenalee :
Ineffective... Way too ineffective!
What?!
In that case, it's my turn now. ORE NO TAAN! YUGIOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Note: This is a parody of Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh! Ore no turn!
Don't use that!
Just stop him!k: um...
Got it, Onee-chan. k: um...
I thought you were in the midst of getting changed...
In your hands.
How much?
Well done, Yume. You have already surpassed me.
You scared me!
I'm actually very good at picking mushrooms!
Totally on purpose, wasn't it!? No accident, your hand didn't slip!
But how should I act cute?
Well then, I'll show you the proper behavior for a cute girl.
A few days back, at Kujuukuri, I was chased, by a pink elephant!
It's was a bit exaggerated though.
I...It doesn't seem like a bad idea... Revenant: Added I... 
W-Well then, how about a well-spoken, proper lady character?
Or rather, I was actually around in every scene.
You're really good...
This is amazing, there are professionals even in this line.
"Someday"... When is that?
We can't leave you alone.
Compared to that hugeness, my troubles are nothing, aren't they?
Eh? Are you running from reality?
Natose-san...
Well then, I as well will...
I see, if that's the case...
What a long phone call.
Actually, the Kuonji household has another member now.
Now then! Let's have a birthday party!
Shinra-sama...
Yes.
It's the world of men.
Eh? I don't know him.
I'll be in your care for a while.
Goodness! What an incapable weakling!
That's not a graceful way of doing things.
Oh dear. My, my.
Oh my dear.
It's not like the Kuki family has no other butlers...
Ren,
Huh?
There, there!
So I'm even lower than Pandas...
Very well. Relax.
I see... You want that kind of tea after all.
Here's your reward.
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and come!
Here, say "ah".
Lower your hips more!
I'm charging your energy level now.
is from the result of their efforts and hard work.
What's wrong?
Yes, although it has many says in different kinds of enterprises, TLC
There's a guest here, don't be lax in security.
Protecting miladies is your job. T: milady's plural form, LOL anyhow, EDIT
Ageha-san... T: or is it Ageha-san? Reve thinks it's -san -.-
Chess! T: Or is it Chest?tlc please
Pathetic fellows. TLC
I surrender! TLC
Ren, you risked your life to protect me, TLC; small fix Reve
Let's have a duel, Ren!
Very well!
Sister, are these our guests?
It has been a while.
No, likewise.
Mirror Kick!
Ageha-sama!
So because of these circumstances,
But I didn't hear about renovating the mansion.
Grilled meat I saw in my dreams!
Oh dear. My, my.
That's why I have prepared something special for you, Miyu-dono.
Oh my dear.
It's not like the Kuki family has no other butlers...
Will I be taking care of Ageha-san?
Shinra-sama!
Shabamisho, Shaomai, Yi Ping!
Very well. Relax.
Yes, Ageha-sama.
You have to serve me with a speed that brings forth a storm!
Dirt spotted!
Take this with you when you go back!
Yes!
Here, say "ah".
You can't even do a landing, you are pathetic. TLCthe manzoku thingy prolly needs to be added
Compared to father's, it's much stronger already TLC T: I don't know what he means
Thanks, Hato-nee.
What preposterous words!
Ren-kun!
yet you are targeted by assassins. Corrected two small things in the sentence, check anyways  split; Reve
It's been longer than scheduled and there are still no signs of her leaving.
Sister!
We'll talk right after that.
So you have.
Oh, no. I'll be going now.
Please let go of me!
Oh? Ren received his first kiss?
Did something unusual happen at the Kuonji house?
Here I go, Kojuurou!
Catch it, Kojuurou!
What are you doing?
She trained me through harsh days!
You can do it if you try!
Why?!
Ageha-sama!
Ageha-sama!!!
I'll get some tea!
Our lives are at stake.x: not life change, lives are at stake
What did you need at this time?
Ageha-sama.
Ageha-sama...
Stop saying that!
If I, Kojuurou, can prove myself a better butler than Ren, will you return?
Last!
Minus one point.
Why is everyone against me?
Yes, Ageha-sama.
Kid!
It's hot!
You... you... you... you... you... you... you... you...
Wow, it sure is a wonderful sight, isn't it?
No, no, not yet.
Hurry up and blow it.
A-At once!
Don't look this way!
Whoa, that's low!
I bet you were imagining what was underneath!
I'll give you this as well.
Yes.
"The Butler's Den"?
You dolt, how can you call yourself a butler to the Kuki family?
Huh? Ah, Tajiri-dono.
The point of this is for it to contain plenty of air.
This is a training method designed to bring out your potential by testing your limits.
Ren, you're going to become a star butler!
Sigh, I bet everyone's enjoying their vacation by now.
It's too much of a hassle to drink it on the rocks.
Yes, as you please.
Leave it to me!
Are you finished already?
299... 300...
Glucose will turn into energy, so you can continue concentrating on your training.
I became relieved and sleepy just by seeing you, Ren-kun.
Miyu-san, where are you going dressed like that?
It's not often I get to see you intoxicated, Miyu-san.
Please don't make fun of me.
G-Go ahead.
You're right.
Where have you been?
Oh, so you came back.
You're finally able to prepare things before I ask you to.
If you get serious, things will only get more complicated.
Okay.
Outside of Japanese food, my cooking skills are better!
The skillful Natose,
So you were here
This passionate scream is...
I heard that Ageha-sama had not returned even though it was past the scheduled date,
Then, with this...
Stop it!
As expected from the house policewoman.
Unfortunately, the kid has gone to pick Ageha-sama up.
No... umm...
She trained me through harsh days!
To put it like that...
Alright, alright.
Ageha-sama!
Ageha-sama...
Ageha-sama!!!
It's not sharp!
Oh, that's right.
I can't cook...
There are things to be trained at night.
You should read them before you sleep.
I will lend them to you.G: previously no translation here, i'm guessing based on what she said and the situation, TLC pleasex: this line should be fine
I even already said it wasn't love... Don't suddenly snap!
You fool!
Return to the mansion and do penance.
Y-Yes!
And opening the event is a servant of the Kuonji family.
Oh look, if you don't hurry you'll lose.
Compared to Ren who carries each piece at full speed, Kojuurou is slow but carries two at a time.
It's just your imagination! Good luck!
Read the atmosphere!
Here are your dessert seconds.
Ageha-sama.
Y-Yeah.
As I thought.
That is...
T-That is...
It's not the time for such a ridiculous answer!
Ageha-sama...
Yes!
It's because you only paid attention to Ageha-sama.
It tickles...
Um, I was just thinking that you two are a great combination!
Miyu-chan is so cute and honest, taking care of you is its own reward.
I'll see you to the entrance hall.
You've become so considerate too.
Yes.
Prepared for what?
W-What's this?
It isn't bad having a pure boy attend to me.
Mihato is fast asleep, so tell me about yourself first.
Even if you ask, I don't really have any nice stories from before I came here..
That's true.
I can see everything...
Oh, it's nothing...
Cut it out! You're going to mess up the food!
You're just a low-ranking servant, and you dare eavesdrop on my private matters?
What did you say?
Since we're friends already.
You're really a weird robot, huh?
You came at a good time. Help us out.
Uh y-y-yes.
Alright poke
If you speak like that, no matter how long passes, you'll never change at all.
Oh, it's Shinra-sama.
What do you think of him?
I'll be fine.
Since we're at it, just go with the red door!
This is a pretty nice game, isn't it?
What was that attitude?
I'm thinking of getting a part-time job and trying to discover myself...
Miyu's turned bad...
My, my, what would she be like if she went astray?
W-What's happened? For my clearheaded sister who was a child prodigy to be doing this...
Oh yeah! It's Miyu-san!
iTwin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin
There it is! Miyu-san's IQ240! joc: seems to sound like 'encore', TLC
Don't get in the way, Ren!
Miyu-san is just taking a break from all her efforts up to now!
Yes, but she's not been doing nothing at all!
All the servants treasure Miyu-san, whether they're assigned to her or not.
Please look at the present her!
Then, as an apology, would you like to go around in your shorts?
Ren! You're my personal attendant!
Ren!
Don't cry... Yume!
Whether as a servant or as a friend, I have to help her no matter what.
It looks like he's become pretty reliable.
It tickles...
Today's schedule?
Yes...
Night, Ren.
Good morning, Miyu-san.
Ren-chan...
That's true.
Poke!
Thanks, but I can finish it up quickly at school.
Yeah...
You're making some nice sounds, did you come already?
Go find a good woman for me!
You incorrigible robot! joc: needs TLC
If you have any problems, just tell me!
Uh y-y-yes.
Yume...
And, what should I do?
Yume, never give up!
To have a father worthy of respect...
Ren.
Do you also plan on devoting your efforts to such areas, and not merely to music?
Yes.
She's really serious and doesn't smile.
Ah, a flying squirrel!
My health's going down! joc: "juu heta"? 10? TLC
This is a pretty nice game, isn't it?
Maybe... it's like this?
What should we do?
Get eaten by the death twin-tails!
Twin-tails makes it! joc: twin-tail tsukurunda? TLC meeded
All the servants treasure Miyu-san, whether they're assigned to her or not.
Please look at the present her!
Then, as an apology, would you like to go around in your shorts?
Then, I'll announce mine too!
Whether as a servant or as a friend, I have to help her no matter what.
Cherries?
Alright, Miyu-chan, banzai!
I'll be going!
My underwear are mostly delicates, so make sure to wash them by hand.
A, Ageha, Ageha...
Let's work hard again tomorrow.
I-I can't sleep!
Peek!
Yume, what's the matter?
Don't put things such a weird way!
Just obediently respect your older sister and accept her benevolence.
For now, I'll take your cell phone as an apology.
We shouldn't get involved with idiots.
You...!
I'll give you some miyu-miyu!
It's your fault!
You're really a weird robot, huh?
Miyu-san isn't just playing.
Miyu-san... umm, earlier, I...
Hmm... Let's see...
Yume, never give up!
Your father, famous in the business world, and also for his environmental and philanthropic activities,
Is this squirrel an ally or an enemy?
You're great, aren't you, Yume?
Yume, fall into the darkness of hell with me.
Could it be something like this?
Anyways!
Don't get in the way, Ren!
Hey, stop that!
That's a wonderful dream.
Yes! I'm coming.
Ren, from tomorrow, be my personal attendant for a while.
It tickles...
Banzai.
Perfect as well, today.
Sister...
I'll see you to the entrance hall.
Starting tomorrow, do your duties properly.
Yes...
Gathering information from the Internet.
Alright...
For now, I'll take your cell phone as an apology.
Are you planning on disobeying me?!
What should we do Beni... shouldn't we stop them?
Hey, what's wrong?
And, what should I do?
Oh, it's Shinra-sama.
the famous Kuonji Banshou --
Do you also plan on devoting your efforts to such areas, and not merely to music?
My dream hasn't changed,
S-Sis...
You bastards! Good job coming to my live show!
She's got those amazing twin tails again today!
i1Twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin twin
Next is IQ240! Let's go!
That's your own taste, right?
I absolutely won't let her go astray!
And?
To create a place for the ones I care for to live happily together.
Yes! I'm coming.
an8I won't save you.
But right now you're my personal attendant!
Ren!
Don't cry... Yume!
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Shin-oneechan?
So it failed...
I only widened the distance between us.
Anyway, I had no intention to hurt you at all!
T-That's true...
You have to support her in times like these.
I'm sorry.
Natose!
I will too!
That's right, I'm sure you'd regret it.
And that's...because we were family after all.
Please treat her kindly!
...for sisters to do this...
Leave this to me, go for Yume.
I'm sorry...
Okay, thanks.
A great tsunami struck, and I was the only survivor in my family.
You're still a child, that's why.
Umm... at that time...
Miyu...
I remembered.
It's true that there are things that can't be undone...
Nee-san suppressed her emotions.
Is something the matter?
Making us worry...
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry...
When you're happy, I'm happy as well.
Natose-san, umm....
It's just a small role before the cherry blossom viewing.
That's not true!
Would you forgive your foolish sister?
Even though I'm your sister, you never hug me...
It seems that I was too concerned about what you said in the past.
if you're able to remember what happened at the time,
But I don't remember anything.
Wait, Shin-oneechan.
Beni-chan, did you call for me?
When did you...?
I might have to fight to the bitter end to protect Ren-chan!
Her wallet is gone too.
Shinra-sama, you shouldn't quarrel with her over something trivial like this!
Even for my damn father...
Miyu-san.
I'm going to look for her!
Seriously?
Want to come in?
but I wonder if I ever came here with Papa?
I couldn't protect anyone.
If you're that worried, maybe you shouldn't have quarreled in the first place.
Shinra-sama...
but you have to believe in their bond as sisters.
But I was saved when I met Yume.
That's why I was able to work hard for your sake.
And similarly, when they're rejected like what happened earlier...
I was told that Papa and Mama were gone.
Yume's just troubled because she can't feel your feelings.
you'll never properly make up with Shinra-sama!
If you talk to her properly, Shinra-sama will understand!
L-Like I said, don't treat me like a child...
For saying something so mean...
I promise you.
Thanks to your encouragement, I was able to properly make up with Shin-oneesan.
You don't have to thank me.
Family...
Milk that you've earned by yourself is delicious!
Soon it will be time for cherry blossom viewing, I'm looking forward to it!
Yes...
Here.
You have to compensate us for this.
Yes!
This guy's a boy!
Chiharu-kun is in love.
I'll be killed.
My tension's increased!
Now that you mention it, that's true...
You're really pathetic.
Well, my subordinate is getting so fired up, I have to do more too!
Are you trying to make it last longer this way?
Your sense is the worst.
Oh, tell me about it!
That's what she said so I took this home!
Yeah, but right after that, I was beaten up, and the medical fees cost me a hundred thousand.
I'm De Niro!
All right, Miyu and I are next.
Well, I just wanted to see Myu-tan cosplay.
I'm the master and you're the maid.
Your fortune shall improve, Shinra shrine.
What are you asking? NM298: They are dressed as Tousaka Rin and Saber from FateStay Night
Now, let's show them our art.
I didn't mean it like that.
Amazing, Ageha-chan!
What a tragic guy.
You fool, don't use such a dangerous move here!
To steal while everyone's having fun...
Ren, Colonel, turn them into sashimi.
Okay!
Yume is asleep from playing too much.
You're someone who doesn't know how to read the atmosphere, eh.
The ball hit somebody.
Come on, let's hurry back.
An exciting thing happened this morning!
The dangerous one is... YOU!
You're thick-headed, Uesugi.
Poppo
The person I like is...
So it wasn't me.
She's strong and dependable.
How about a ramen tour?
In Beniko's case...
Yeah! But it's really unusual for you to ask me to come here.
Your tension's too high.
If Ren was here I'd be able to punch out my stress!
A cask? Hey...
I have brought it!
I just had a surge of inspiration, De Niro.
Good job, Michael!
Natose-san...
What a pathetic master and servant.
Hey, wait, De Niro!
Yeah! I feel like my brain is going numb!
It's a joke.
Don't say dangerous things!
Look, it's well-sculpted, right?
Alright, I'll respond to your cheers and show you another piece of art.
A-again?
Yeah.
Now that I look at you, you have a handsome face.
A punishment is necessary.
I guess I beat him up too much.
Oh? Then, should I go in with you?
Put it back in the car.
Isn't it part of the Kuonji estate?
Colonel! Here I go!
Amazing!
Ren-kun, watch out!
Beni, get ready.
Oh Ren, pour me some alcohol.
Shinra-sama...
Yeah.
Even though theres nobody I hate more than him...
you came here to serve me.k: better use "serving me" instead
Who would you cry from that?
Do my best for you.
Wasn't it my turn next?
That's right, you're going overboard!
Ren-kun, I'm counting on you.
That will be it.
Sit next to me.
Shinra-sama?
I'm in paradise!
My skills should be better than before.
There was nothing in your performance that could touch the heart.
Shinra-sama, here is your coffee milk.
That's her disposition.
I want to concentrate.
Will you go on a date with me?
Even when you were studying abroad?
Colonel took care of those persistent ones.
Can I take a picture with you?
That's, well... since it's a date, lasting impressions are important.
I won't catch a cold with a small breeze like this.
What is it?
If you're able do the things that you want to do...
Shinra-sama, I just want...
If it's Ren-chan, you don't have to worry.
You, the one who killed your mom!
You've already died within her!
Don't lose to fate!
I can't do this!
Beni!
Grin.
Since you have a pretty skin...
You must take good care of it.
I'll take your offer.
Not only am I sea-water resistant, but...
However...
Huh? Are there sharks around here?
Hey, that's bruised.
Doesn't it feel great to buy good things cheap?
I don't think an geezer's old story has anything to do with this.
According to her story...
If she weren't scouted by the Kuonji family...
Shinra-sama.
Huh?
What choice did I have when they were holding her hostage?
What you're saying is, since this is the basement of a summer house you've rented...
You probably rented this place to bring over girls, but...
Not cute at all, dirty with money, and without the least bit of tenderness.
My sister's doctrine:
That's the way I lived up to now.
Stop acting tough.
You don't know how it feels.
And learned many things.
I'm...
Actually, I work as a butler at a certain mansion.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Shibutaku-kun, what are we going to do?
Huh?
What the hell was that voice?
Who the hell are you people?
Open your eyes for the next Kimiaru.
To sexually harass the servants and your sisters, the Kuonji head must really be trash.
Yeah, I was sweating pretty bad today.
Oh Ren, pour me some alcohol.
You are a quick learner, and you remember the preferences of the masters very quickly.
I...
No,
Who would you cry from that?
Wasn't it my turn next?
That's not fair!
Ren-kun, I'm counting on you.
Then for the promotions of the ones concerned at regular intervals, you'll have a recording for TV programs.
What kind of person is he?
It was a pretty difficult schedule today.
Teacher, I want to know what you thought about my performance tonight.
My skills should be better than before.
Croissant?
The loli should worry about her own work instead.
Even though she chatters incessantly about unimportant stuff,
Farewell, Shounopo...
You gave it a name already?
Congratulations.
I went there to study music.
Now that you've let everything out, how about a picture for a keepsake?
In my eyes, ever since the moment I saw you on TV,
Without discerning your limits of being a butler,
Colonel, come and fetch me immidiately.
Brat, go and cool off.
Pressure and the like, I'll shrug it all off on my own.
What are you doing?
Shinra-sama.
Alright.
You're either getting dead drunk or hurting others.
I, um...
You thought I might say that?
Aren't you always like that?
The real Shinra-sama bears responsibilities as the head of the house, and faces society's assessment and anticipation,
I've heard everyone's appeals,
You called, Shinra-sama?
His strange behaviour might be due to that guy's presence.
What shall we do?
That's Ren's father eh?
You've have to beat up kids to discipline him.
What's with this bitch?
That was what I wanted to say!
A guy who hits a girl...
Is a bastard!
You're going to abandon me?
When will you come back?
The Ultimate Lightning Attack!
I'm so sorry to make such a request just before the performance.
But Kuonji Shinra.
Not anyone else's. Only yours, Shinra.
Don't try and fool me with that cheerful greeting!
Then please lock the door!
My, my! You can always seek out your sister for help if you can't take it.
You're saying sorry to the wrong person!
She's burning the midnight oil?
Understood.
Mihato, don't be rash.
Do I need any other reasons?
Oh really? Then I guess I've no choice.
so as a father, I really have to give the hosts my greetings, eh?
Don't!
We should have fun together as a family of three again.
I just can't do it!
You've been doing your best all along, hoping your master's dreams would be fulfilled.
I feel like I understand Shinra-sama's feelings now.
Thank goodness, Ren-kun!
It's something to be happy about, so put on your smile!
Its not good to keep it inside you.
Shinra-sama's concert is tomorrow evening.
What the hell?
Have you forgotten that I was the one who brought you up?
Since you understand then call Mihato over now!
Ren, don't go.
But if I don't do what he says...
I can't take listening to this any more.
What's with this bitch?
When I was a kid, I thought that some day, you'd turn over a new leaf.
That's impossible.
What's wrong? Do it.
You're not different.
I'm no longer a kid you can abuse.
Father.
Will you promise not to use violence from now on?
Don't act like you know everything when you're still so little, Ojou-chan.
But Kuonji Shinra.
Shinra-sama, it was a great success!
Its your Onee-chan's turn next!
Err...
Good luck, Miyu!
Yo!
But I'm just getting more comfortable at a place like this!
You're right!
I hear you're doing well.
Then, I'm on my way.
H-Have a good day.
If Yume is sad, then so am I.
Good boy, good boy.
Hey, Yumecchi! Your obentou is here!
Ojou-sama.
I-If only a savior would appear at times like this!
My, you're larger than life!
I'm envious of you!
It's my turn!
Oh, Miyu Onee-chan!
I used my yandere powers on the wrong person!
O-Okay?
Huh?
Complete victory, V!
Therefore...
I can do things like that, too!
Miyu-sama will demonstrate it for you.
Well, the ball was passed to me so suddenly...
No one can stop us!
Crushed!
Mihato!
I-In that case...
Would it be something like this?
Hey, Nee-san. Bullying isn't cool.
Awesome.
Things will be fine, Natose-san.
Nothing good will come out by panicking.
You should allow your personality to naturally develop instead of having to ask others about it.
Your composure is amazing.
As a butler, I only did what I had to.
Kimiaru ep.7 avant 9, A 22
Shinra-sama, please wake up.
Intruders!
It's been a while.
Geez, what a wimp not to be able to take something like that.
Listen to what people have to say!
You sure did your homework, researching everyone's likes.
I'm going to name them.
Huh?
We're teens who are as frail as glass!
Eh?!
So cute! So cuddly!
Ceremonies?
Oh!
Come on Kojuurou, heal up your wounds and...
Compared to what the old man did, this is nothing.
Ren-chan...
Ageha-sama, you're nice towards the elderly.
Right, old people are the nation's treasure.
Y-You have a brash attitude!
But it's such a waste to use your pretty hands only to hit people.
It looks like I was right when I first set my eyes on you...
Ageha-sama!
Ren-kun!
As expected of you, Ageha-sama!
What's the matter? Chickening out?
Eh?
Shinkuuretsuzan!
You too!
My discomfort index is rising!
The skillful Natose, the culinary proficient Mihato,
Miyu-tan's still a child, right?
Ageha-sama!
This unpleasant scream can only be...
I'll be finished with this soon, so you can start preparing supper.
And strict towards others.
It's not sharp!
Why?
You may go home now.
Ageha-sama...
Y-Your breasts are touching my back.
Ren-kun has improved thanks to Ageha-sama.
I'm hungry...
I'm sorry.
Ren-chan...
G-Good night!
What am I doing, almost getting myself enticed?
This is... Ageha-sama?
Those who attempt to interfere with people's love life should...
My hands are roaring aflame!
Glistening and yelling to defeat you!
Become the light!
Is that the reason why you are staying here?
If you got the message, then leave at once.
Hato-nee...
I-I'm on a diet.
Compared to the recently hired Ren, Kojuurou has a slight advantage, as he has been employed since he was little.
With my pride on the line now, I defintely can't lose.
Ageha-sama...
He wasn't his usual self from the start.
Please, give me a break!
Kimiaru ep.9
Start off by keeping track of my schedule.
Good morning.
I'm perfect today, as always.
Oh, thank you very much.
H-How is my stroke?
Let's see... tomorrow's schedule.
My, my... your uniform will get all wrinkled.
Let's provide our services again tomorrow.
Let's have a talk and strengthen the bond between master and servant.
My dream is...
Is to live happily with Hato-nee.
Then, I guess it can't be helped, you naughty boy.
The assignment I have to submit today isn't finished yet.
What's with you, Miyu-tan, acting like a big sister from the morning?
Hey baby, come with me!
I'll let you off with your cell phone!
You two are in for some punishment!
What did you say?
How do you feel about him?
who will lead the Nanahama Philharmonic Orchestra for their coming up regularly scheduled concert.
She wasn't just serious, she didn't even crack a smile.
You guys!
What's with her attitude?
Hey bastards, glad you could make it to my live stage!
The next song is "IQ 240", here we go!
I bet it's your taste.
I'll save you!
What the master owns is the master's, what her sister owns is also the master's.
Shut up!
Let's eat!
Yume?

next episode preview
Yume, were you concerned over such things?
Go ahead and scoff at your narrow-minded sister.
Yume, will you forgive your foolish sister?
Shin Onee-chan...
Do you really not remember it?
Yume Ojou-sama.
It's a matter of feelings.
Beni-chan, did you call for me?
Ah, the passion of youth.
No, leave me alone for now.
I feel sad if Onee-chan isn't cheerful, too.
I don't know.
A tragedy stemming from Yume-cchi's low profile, huh.
When it's my job to protect Yume...
You'll regret it for sure.
Miyu-san.
Congratulations, Yume!
Not today.
T-The nightscape is pretty, isn't it?
Remember when I told you that I was born and raised on a tropical island?
Haven't they called yet?
It looks like Ren and Natose forgot to take their cell phones with them.
Coming to a country where the language and culture was different, and messing up everyday.
That's why I was able to work hard for Yume's sake.
I wanted to cry, too!
The Nee-san back then...
Yume can't go back home.
Shin Onee-chan...
...was only thinking... about herself...
Natose-san, um...
Although I can no longer see the Southern Cross we all gazed at...
Everybody is going to appear in the second half.
You guys, go for it!
Huh? No one's home?
Nostalgic?
U-Um...
I'm sorry.
You...
Damn it, you traitor!
Kouichi!
I didn't hear anything.
They're still in France. I'm the only one who came back.
I'll be transferring to Kibina High School as a third year.
Certainly...
Really?
By the way, why did you come here, Kazuki?
You showed up, Gori Kong.
Cut!
I came up with the idea yesterday, and I immediately went to the Drama Club to request them.
Aren't you frustrated?
It's really exciting after all!
No, she might not have changed.
Nana-chan?
I'm back!
I see! Then we'll all be together.
Yo!
Kouichi! How was it?
You guys aren't part of the Go-Home Club?
How about it?
I'd prefer to do something I like after school.
Nice to meet you, Mizusawa-san.
Yes, they're childhood friends.
How do you know Sanada-kun?
This teacher is kind of cute.
I'll be having you practice with me during breaks from now on.
N-No, it's nothing.
Do you have a tutor?
Who's throwing this around?
It's zero points.
Why do I suck at rock, paper, scissors?
U-Um...
We're in the same class again, Sanada-kun.
Excuse me...
What?
No, that's not what I mean.
I don't need it anymore.
But, it's yours, so I'll return it.
Hey.
Eh?! Kazuki sure is acting weird.
Here!
5:30 AM...
Ah, okay.
All right, we're off!
Did I say something that rubbed you the wrong way?
Then what's wrong?
I don't think that's true.
You wanted to talk to me about something, right?
Yes, um...
Auntie!
I'm home...
There's no need to worry about me, right?
For Yuumi-chan. Yuumi-chan.
Huh?
Cold medicine...
Cold medicine...
I guess I can't ask her.
Please don't die, my dear brother!
Furthermore...
Hey, I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd stop by.
Hiiragi-sama...
So, what is it? Hey!
Auntie said they'll be coming home late.
Not that.
Why...
I was searching for my contact,
It was so bad it was like torture!
but that person looked like they were crying.
I'm not really sure, but it seems like a fitting house for a lady.
You're coming too, Eriko-chan?
Amazing...
Well then, let's start inspecting the first location.
We'll just look around at random, then.
It's amazing here as well, Naru-chan!
What are you looking at?
That's a semperflorens.
This piano looks pretty expensive, too.
There are lots of western ones, too. Isn't it amazing, Yuumi-chan?
Yuumi-chan?
Please add a bit of red wine.
It looks so good!
It's potato soup called vichyssoise.
Yeah, you treated us to a real feast.
That sounds fun! I've never played hide and seek in the house before!
Oh, I got red.
Sanada-kun!
Six!
Ten!
Yes, me too.
Sure.
I heard this from Kouichi, but is it true that you haven't met your fianc yet?
I'm sure you'll be able to experience love, Mitsuki-chan.
Have you experienced love?
I see. That's good, then.
I guess so. But I don't know either, actually.
It's true, I don't mind being with everyone as much now.
What about you, Aihara?
An experiment.
Sorry.
I have to go somewhere.
Didn't you have something to do today?
Do you think you'll be able to write a good script?
Yeah, I have a good image of it now.
That can't be true.
The cooking at Shijou-sempai's place was really good!
Only about two months left...
Your lucky point is curry-flavored potato chips!
Your lucky point will be mackerel miso.
Don't let these kinds of chances get away!
Um...
I studied a lot, so I'm going to let loose now.
Are you off to eat lunch too?
my lucky point was sauted foie gras.
Could that meal be the caviar udon from last time?
Udon! Udon!
It's normal.
But...
It's not a bad feeling.
Let's go home together. BAW CHIKKA WAH WAH
Uh, what would be good?
Do you want to eat here?
It's not really coming together.
Can... we hold hands?
No, your bone or ligaments might be injured.
Hey, it's all right! You don't need to overreact.
What are you going to do when you can't play soccer anymore?
Thank you.
Asuka-sempai!
One, two...
We improved on the lunch box we made during the swimming competition.
You can't do that, Nana.
Thanks...
Ah, no, I'll be okay.
Yeah...
Anyway, hurry up and get better.
Yeah...
I see, getting along is a beautiful thing.
No...
I always do it near the end of summer.
I've never had to worry about homework during the summer.
I guess you can't, huh?
Yeah, later.
Sorry for the wait, Kai-kun.
Sakino, how was I?
How was my play?
Ah, sorry.
The sea...
Hey, wait up!
Hurry up, Kai-kun! Over here!
Thanks. Is that your boyfriend?
Then, Kazuki didn't drink his milk and started crying.
When he found out the girl he liked drank milk, he started drinking it too!
Weird, right?
He-
I thought I'd spend my time with Kouichi, Kazuki, and the others.
How long are you going to sleep, Kouichi?
Yeah.
Going to making some memories, huh?
We can go to the beach anytime! Isn't there someplace-
Damn it!
With a half-hearted play like that, you won't make it as a starting member this time.
Gather around!
I'll now be announcing the starting line and substitution members.
I'll be okay. I'll just eat what's here.
That's why I want to leave my current self behind,
Come on, Aihara-sempai!
That's just like you, to agree with it.
You sure you don't want fried rice or ramen?
Yeah.
Great, what were you doing?
Go ahead.
I'm sure Yuumi-chan will be happy, too.
As a club member, you have no right to refuse.
I'll do it too.
I thought about a few places, but I have no money.
Okay.
That Kouichi is totally getting along with Hoshino-san.
Later.
Hoshino-san.
W-W-What are you saying?
But...
Oh, what's that?
Thanks for treating us!
Refreshing and considerate.
Thank you.
"Now's the Time"
she fits the image perfectly.
I'm just talking about whether she'll accept or not.
Geez, it's just Sakino.
Yeah.
She's just not picking up...
So, I see!
Mom!
Being a novelist won't bring food to the table, you know.
By the way, his favorite foods are fried chicken and omelettes.
What's up with you?
Good luck!
The movie's heroine?!
But...
Hello?
Can I come in, Mao-neechan?
It's okay.
It's just, well...
You being so cheerful.
What are these experiments?
Yeah.
Later.
Really? Good work.
No, it's because you seemed strange today.
Your acting was perfect, Mizusawa-sempai!
where you two walk down the beach after the confession.
Let's try one more time, then.
Are you okay, Mizusawa-sempai?
Aihara...
I'm surprised you know this place, Hoshino-san.
Ah, the cool udon is mine!
The yakisoba and the blue hawaii are mine.
Okay, just leave them around there.
Yeah, I've been neglecting the experiments.
Is that so?
Do you want to-
You don't need to worry about me.
We don't have many defenders.
Kazuki has been working hard recently, too.
Eh? Again?
Did you wait long?
I'm not sure what's going on now.
Well, I guess so.
I guess it wasn't anything special to her.
No, nothing.
Welcome back.
There's no reason to cry after reading a picture book.
I'm crying because it's so sad!
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Am I that untrustworthy?
It's time for my job.
You shouldn't be sliding there, Aihara!
and it'd help out with university exams, too.
You're always going out on dates.
I do understand.
It's nothing, go away!
I'll make Nello and Patrasche happy for sure!
Damn that Nana, she doesn't even care about me.
Did I try to understand her?
Mizusawa...
Didn't you film today?
You will only suffer when you care seriously for someone.
Where were you walking, to become like that?
Come on, let's go!
What's with that?
Futami-san...
Yeah.
Hey, Futami-san.
Yeah.
Sanada called me earlier about it.
Yeah.
I guess I should replace it.
Ready...
All right then, let's try once more!
We'll start where you left off.
No, you don't need to apologize.
Let's take a break, then.
Tea!
Snacks! Snacks! Snacks! Udon!
That's Kouichi's, isn't it?
Sorry.
It's all thanks to you.
and then this discussion will be over.
I wonder what I should have you get me, then?
Are you going to work now?
Yeah.
Mao-neechan.
Why?
Tell me if there's anything I can do for you.
Why, you say?
Come on, you have morning practice, don't you? You'll be late!
All right already! I'm up!
Don't worry about what happened yesterday.
Let's just have fun like we usually do, okay?
Ah, Kazuki said that he had soccer practice in the morning.
I see.
Damn, I let one by me.
What are you doing?
Well then, here is the result for the poll.
That's a problem, Aihara.
We don't have enough staff in the Movie Club either.
Let's do it! U-U-don!
We're going to register for the Movie Club's participation.
Hiiragi, where's Kazuki?
Well, I'll be going to practice now.
Since when?
You said that,
Yay! We got the place that stands out the most.
Let's do our best!
What are you saying?
Then, let's discuss once more why we need "club"! Probably better as, "Then, let's discuss once more why we need to be a "club"!"
Ah, but it'll be better to show them after we fix his name.
Shijou-sempai!
Are you going home now?
Hoshino-san?
I...
When I no longer became nervous talking to others.
You can change.
We were both mistaken from the start.
I was afraid of liking you.
If I knew I was going to suffer this much, I'd rather had been alone!
It doesn't matter how we met!
Yeah, I'm fine.
What were you...?
It was different from what I imagined.
Yeah... I'm your landlord after all.
What did you put on your bag?
The person I'm going out with is a girl from a different school, though. grammar
Um...
Now that I think about it...
W-Why do you know that much?!
Juliet-chan!
That's enough already!
Yes...
Futami Eriko.
What I know is probably what you already know.
Futami Eriko, a student from 2nd Year Class C.
Now, she keeps a distance and no one tries to approach her. grammar
Safe...
W-Well, we only have three members.
She's Naru-chan from the same class!
Naru-chan's goal is to make Japan's most delicious udon!
Third years are in the Go-Home Club.
They probably go to cram school.
The others don't do anything but talk about exams.
Could it be...
What happened yesterday.
I see. I understand. structure
Futami-san...
Well...
This DVD is so entertaining! structure
We were in the same class last year but,
The girl I admire is going to be at the karaoke party?!
To be honest, it was tough.
I lost my support and my balance.
I'd just make you suffer even more if I was moping about it.
Kai-kun...
I didn't want to see Mao-neechan's tears.
That's my conclusion.
What's it called? Becoming the role?
The heroine's feelings just got to me.
Like I'm saying...!
About... the other day.
It doesn't matter how we met!
I'll give you credit this time for approaching her with everyone around.
I thought I'd tell you what you're missing.
We filmed that part yesterday, though.
That line earlier was cool.
She didn't seem that bad yesterday, though.
That won't work.
It doesn't matter how we met.
Did you want something?
I'd forget how lame I was...
Hey, how do feelings change?
What's wrong, mom?
She's moving out of this house.
It feels like it was just the other day when I came to this house.
I cause a lot of trouble, but,
Just a bit.
The weather looks good today.
and there's a lot of stuff to make, so it's real tough.
It's the dashi we stayed up all night to make.
Y-Yeah.
Hey.
Oh, Hiiragi.
Morning...
Come on, make a comeback!
Aihara-kun, take your seat!
Please be serious and continue working.
Or maybe not!
You're really good at drawing, Kai-kun!
Ah, no...
What are you doing, Hiiragi-kun?
Can't you tell by looking?
But she probably will have moved out by then.
Moving... Is she going back to France?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
What?!
Nice clear, Aihara!
Sorry, sorry!
Sanada...
I can't have them taking care of me all the time.
You're moving once the school festival is over, right?
Yajima.
Okai.
She's been looking down these past few days, though.
It's your day off, and you're not even going out on a date.
You should help Yuumi-chan rather than me, then.
I'm moving, but it's within walking distance.
The scenery is changing.
We just need to move forward step by step.
The school festival will begin the day after tomorrow, huh?
It'll have to be in the afternoon, is that okay?
M-Morning.
Yes, it's perfect for my level,
I wish there was something we could do.
Ah, that's right!
Hey, come help the class, too!
Others have club work too, but they still help their classes, you know!
I see.
But if I head towards a new goal, I think things will become more positive.
Oh no, I really did it now!
You've been odd lately.
Excuse me.
This one's no good, either?
Sorry for interrupting, but I have something to discuss.
By the way, Eri-chan...
What am I saying?
Eh, me?
Okay.
What's all this...
It was Shijou-sempai's idea.
You just found out about it too, onii-chan.
I don't think I'll come today, and my father is coming home soon as well.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
What's he talking about?
That's wonderful!
Eh? You're going already?
I haven't cleaned up my room yet.
You're pretty late, have you eaten yet?
So, it's finally done?
Oh yeah, what time is the screening again?
That "sometimes" was unnecessary.
It's okay, don't say that.
Come on, you too, Sanada.
Okay.
All right, let's go, Hoshino-san.
Where should we go?
Congratulations.
Welcome! Welcome!
One banana crepe and one chocolate crepe, please!
All right, if I get a goal in today's match...
Sure.
Onii-chan! move me down too
Do your best!
Are you patrolling?
Aihara-kun!
That was a good match.
Sorry for suddenly bringing this up.
The number you have dialed is either out of range or out of bat-
Thank you!
Why are you looking for Futami-sempai?
She's not here either?
The seats at the back are free.
I see.
You sure played a big role.
Could it be a date?
Pretty good, Kazuki.
You're alone, Yuumi-chan? Where's Kouichi?
he looked very manly.GARlock
Bye.
Oh?
I'm sorry, Sakino.
The more I love him...
Hey.
It was worth working hard for this!
I can't just leave a classmate in trouble alone.
I won't forgive you if you become half-hearted again.
Hoshino-san...
Then I thought that it was really true.
I'll just find you again.
I've always been lying.
I lied to myself, I lied to Hoshino-san...
I decided that I won't let you cry, be hurt or be alone again!

Really?

Oh? Kuryuu-san.
How nice...
We're sorry!
Ah, sorry.
Did I startle you?
If you want romance novels, there are some more in that corn-
No, as the public morals officer, this is the natural thing for me to do.
"H-How'd you know?"
If, for argument's sake, that I would happen to go out with a boy,
I told you it's not red!
Yeah, an older guy is calmer and might be more reliable.
I-It was nothing.
I just happened to find it anyway.
What about you?
Yeah, yeah! It was just amazing!
Oh, you too?
You're a real big help.
Yeah.
How so?
It just kind of feels that way.
I just need to go at my own pace.
What class are you in and what's your name?

But, she seems to know me. punctuation

Nana!
Oh, you're early.
Y-Yeah!
Anyway, can I come to your store again?spelling
He said to bring you again.
Really, then maybe I'll go there today!grammar
What about studying for the test, though?
It looked like he left in a hurry.
Sakino, come here!grammarspace
That's enough.
I wonder what went wrong?
Huh, Mao-neechan hasn't come back yet.grammar
What should I do?
I wonder if Mao-neechan will be back soon.
She was such a nerd during middle school though.
Yo.
He says he wants a consultation from you.grammar
Was it hea8590v100100y?
All right.
You're a genius Juliet-chan!
That's my worst subject.
You can't e8590v100100en remember the approximate year?
I see.
Um...
Yeah.
What's with that attitude?
Kouichi, that girl was Futami-san, right?
Well then, I'm taking the train.
Kouichi, don't become a wolf when seeing her off.
Really.
The problem is, who will play as the heroine?
This is where I can show my skills as the leader.
a cycle that goes out of spin,
I knock on the door to your heart,
Your RUBY eyes are what absorb me in.

and confesses to him.
I see, lo8590v100100e brought it all together.
You're showing off so boldly. Ah, I'm so jealous!
Aside from that, the story is fine. 
The time to lea8590v100100e was quite a while ago.
Naru and I were researching how to prepare delicious udon dashi.
We were kicked out by a teacher, though.
You girls too?
Grandpa!
I brought some customers!
Nello and Patrache died!
Men shouldn't wear piercings!
Y-Yeah.
I'm looking for a quality, charming person.
No, no one.
If it's come to this, I guess I'll ha8590v100100e to go around to the first year classes.
It was passi8590v100100e, but it's a step forward.
You're going to drink coffee, right?
No.
That's that.
Um, what kind of experiment is that?
Could it be you ha8590v100100e bad taste, Futami-san?
That's quite arrogant of you.
Are you saying your taste is accurate?
There's an old, infamous ramen restaurant in front of the train station.
She has been going out a lot lately too. Could that person be...  mreweilk break these lines as indicated please
Wow! It's the person who was in that ama8780z100100ing car!
It's on the house, grandpa's treat! 
Isn't it?
I feel kind of bad for just sitting.

be10The sparkle and eternity are cut short.
Good morning, onii-chan!
Really?
Is something up?
I-It's nothing!
Don't just show up and say easily misunderstood things, Hiiragi!
I wonder what Kai-kun's intention was.
Muratani-san?
I know myself the best.
This is no time to be saying things that.
Okay.
It probably doesn't look like a date at all.
Berry-berry ramen?!
Yeah, make it a big portion, too.
I'm so hungry!
I don't want to be told that by you!
That's true!
I'll try to think of you more seriously from now on.
Hey, do you want to go out and play? We'll go all out!structure
Is it strange?
How does it feel to lo8590v100100e someone?
That makes it my tenth win in a row.
I talked to you about my childhood friend, right?
That's right.
You two get along well?
This is quite serious.
Your grandpa is quite the gourmet.
I feel quite honored to be able to talk to Futami-san like this.
Still, to think that Futami-san has bad taste.

Don't tell me you're fine with this synopsis.
Oh, this?
That?
All right, it's settled!
Well, that's true.
This is Kai-kun from my class.
Sorry, I think I'm going to go home after all.
May I come in, Mao-neechan?
You're sure home early today.
No.
Oh yeah, I ha8590v100100e a cute swimsuit I bought in France!
No, nothing happened!
I can't wear contacts in the pool,
And you're on the white team, Aihara.
What are you going to do?
Before the matches start, be sure to put them away in your locker!
Don't worry about it.
Kuryu-san from our team is doing her best too.
She can only stand out at times like these.
I thought of 8590v100100arious ways to make it nutritionally balanced.
It's as good as the one I ate at Satonaka Udon.
Perhaps it's as good as the berry-berry ramen, too.
By the way, aren't you going to swim, Futami-san?
I wonder what's wrong?
Y-Yeah.
I should return these to Mao-neechan.
This is nothing!
That's right, you shouldn't push yourself!
Ready.
We need Asuka-sempai after all!
for all those participating in the mixed relay, please gather around the start line.
I was deeply mo8590v100100ed!
I'll follow you anywhere!
Oh no, the atmosphere is becoming stiff again!
It's fine that e8590v100100eryone's experiencing some youthful drama but...
Did you find any girls that could appear in the swimsuit scene?
U-Um...
A swimsuit, right?
How about 3-C's Shinjou-kun?
Sorry about the goggles.
It's nothing.
That's fine then.
Where did it go?!
If you ha8590v100100e any worries, I'd like it if you confided in me.
and blue sky,
I am here because of your kiss,
be10It looks like its about to fall apart.
Is something wrong?
No...
It's nothing.
Here!
What was that dream just now?
I was being noisy this morning, so she woke up early to help me.
Come on, stop standing around and go wake your dad.
Why are you mentioning him out of nowhere?
We aren't fighting or anything.
Ah, yeah...
I got it.
so I took shelter here and there.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
There's no need to worry about me, right?
Furthermore...
I see, a cold, huh?
You're quite unlucky since neither your family nor Mi8780z100100usawa-sempai is here.
I'd be happy to if you're fine with me.
Well, take care.
A princess will appear, a king will appear...
What about "cheering up?"
Kouichi!
You don't need to do anything unnecessary either.
In the end you got a cold and I ha8590v100100e to take care of you now!
But...
But, you were really out-of-tune.
Welcome to my home!
but that person looked like they were crying.
KISS! KISS! Im in love.
I knock on the door to your heart,
Barely in sight,
be10It looks like its about to fall apart.
The chef is awaiting further instructions.
Who knows?
What... is it?
You're late, Kouichi and Mao-neechan!
This is so exciting!
Yeah!
So, without further ado,
Let's see...
There's the main building, the western-style house,
We have three pools.
We'll just look around at random, then.
Geez, they just don't listen.
What are you looking at?
Even I'm better than this.
Ah, that's a rough sketch by Gogh.
U-Um...
It's a maculata.
F-Forget about me!
Wait up!
Please add a bit of red wine.
Wow!
so please, eat.
Is something wrong?
So how is it, Hiiragi?
I think I've got it.
Let's separate into pairs by lottery, then.
I've wanted to talk to you at least once about some things.
Sure.
I'd like to ask something personal too. How about you, Mizusawa-sempai?
I'm not really sure about it.
Did they leave?
Well, I'm willing to accept her good traits.
A-Ah, um...
So, how is it?
I should've suggested something that everyone can play together.
What a weird face.
What about you, Aihara?
About the experiment?
No, I don't mind it at all!
What was that?
We found you!
It's nothing, really.
It was so fun, and I thought it'd be great if it could continue, and...

I've got to be brave.
Hey, Mao-neechan.
No, that's not what I mean.
Is he happy this morning because it's almost summer vacation?
Well, that's...
helping me train in the mornings?
I can help you anytime if you want.
What about you?
I'm so hungry.
make a special udon, and bring it to you in the science room.
Wouldn't shrimp be better than caviar then?
It's not like I couldn't solve the problem.
What's wrong?
Do you want to eat here?
I think a hamburger store would be better.
It's not really coming together.
but it makes you really happy.
You're pretty good today, Aihara-kun!
Yeah, but if you get a little too cocky...
Are you here, sensei?
This should be fine.
What are you going to do when you can't play soccer anymore?
I have an umbrella!
What is it?
My ride just arrived.
That's why I said you didn't need to overreact and that I'd be okay.
The rain just won't stop.
What should I do? My throbbing heart doesnt know,
be10The sparkle and eternity are cut short.
It'll come true if I tell him.
Or something like that?
Yeah...
C-Chicken wing?
Thanks, I'll eat it with pleasure.
I see.
Really?
You're surprisingly pretty nice, Aihara.
I don't think Futami-san would get along with you just like that.
Then what about later?
I'm amazed that you completed it.
It's all because Sanada-kun did his best.
I only helped a bit.
I've never had to worry about homework during the summer.
I guess you can't, huh?
Thanks.
Huh?
Well, the chance is low, but,
All right!
You're always deciding things like that.
Thanks for treating me.
Is something wrong?
Amazing! I'm surprised you knew about this store.
You like playing games, right?
I want to try it.
Let's stay a little longer, okay?
Hurry up, Kai-kun! Over here!
Geez, just what is it?
Okay?
Weird, right?
Aihara-kun's a pretty earnest guy.
Even if you transfer, we'll always be together.
Wait, that's on the day of the match!
a cycle that goes out of spin,
and blue sky,
be10The truth is that even when you're alone, you're not
Sanada-kun...
Plans for summer, huh?
I don't really have any plans.
Yeah.
Even though it's a practice match, don't let your guard down.
I was totally bored at home.
It was more like a figure of speech.
and I was invited to join.
Thanks.
You don't need to worry about it anymore.
But...
Here we are at Arihara on the first day of summer.
Eh?! Futami-san?!
Aihara-kun is finally getting into it.
Aihara-kun! Don't look at the ball, look at the person!
I've been hiding it all this time, but,
Great, what were you doing?
Now? Nothing, really.
I see.
That's a bit...
It's close, and you don't need to overwork yourself.
Kouichi really likes Yuumi-chan.
We have to film during the entire summer?
And it's still not enough.
Please do it.
I'm indebted to both of you!
It's going to be great.
Tell mom I'll be home late, okay?
I want to leave behind as many memories as possible.

You said that we should enjoy our time by having fun and experiencing love.grammar

If you're looking for Kazuki, then...grammar
She chases him down pretty often.
Were you the type of person to watch love dramas, Aihara?
Yeah.grammar
I'm happy with just being able to have fun playing soccer once in a while.
And have you ever been popular, even once?!
You have a girl like that, too?grammar
A-Ah, no, I don't.grammar
They sure have a lot going for them, huh?
I haven't spoken to her once since then.
As expected from a girl genius.
We live in a different world from her.
I-I made it somehow.
Thanks.
I start to think of the feelings of the people that gave me these.grammar

Sorry, please let me use a bed.
I see.
You can just take the one beside me.

That's an unusual last name.

Yeah, I realized while I was editing it... grammar
I was thinking of letting you handle the screenplay for our next project.structure
Put all your feelings into it.
Well, I'll leave it at that.

If we did it together, it'd be practice for you too, right?
Mao-neechan seems a bit busy though.
I love you!
I'm sorry.
The truth is I love you!
Take 13.
It's cool soumen noodles.
Good work.
It's all thanks to you.
He just never talks about anything that happens in school.
Then, you know his dreams for the future too?
W-What are you talking about, mom?!
M-Mao-neechan sure is late.
Am I a bother after all?
You don't need to feel so down.
I'm back.
And it's the script Sanada-kun did his best to write!
Yuumi-chan cares so much for you.
you worked really hard.
Yeah.
You have a digital camera, right?
Don't look at me too much.
S-Sorry! I didn't mean to!
Okay.
Was I really pushing myself?

Good work, Kai-kun.
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.
But, I...
You're completely into the role!

Yes, yes, now both of you get closer and hold hands.
Ah, s-sorry! Some other things just came into my mind!
Ready.
Start!
Sorry, it was kind of r-rou...
Aihara...
S-Sorry...
Good work today.
No, don't worry about it.
Today's a day off from filming, so I'll just take it easy.
Sorry for the wait!
Hey, Sakino, what do you think?
It'll get worse if I push myself again.
What kind of relationship do you have with Aihara-kun?
Sorry, Hoshino-san.
Mizusawa...
I can't trick myself anymore.
Barely in sight,
be10Always consider that,
be10Don't forget
I said, let's end them.
Yeah, this is the third day.
Where's Mao-neechan?
No, I just got here.
Recently, Mao-neechan has been going out every day.
Kiss me.
I came to visit.
Hey, did you put it on?
Welcome back.
All right, it's a promise, then!
No, the filming took up all my time, so I couldn't do it.
Which one should I pick?
I have that one at home, so I'll lend it to you.
Here.
Am I that untrustworthy?
That's not it.
You're busy with dates too, aren't you?
So, I said a bit too much.
All right.
Okay!
I seem to be in top shape.
be10But try to think about this:
be10because this sky and moon go 'round
But...
But...
Forget it and bring some towels, Kouichi.
Summer is going to end after tomorrow.
We have to go to school the day after tomorrow.
I didn't get to play at all because of the Udon Association and the Movie Club's filming.
Ah, it's the phone.
Futami-san...
I'll let you two talk alone now.
When I was young, I used to play a lot on the swings with Kouichi and Mao-neechan.
Have a seat.
Thanks.
Why do people love?
I don't think anyone knows why they fall in love.
Me?
I-I guess.
Or they thought their feelings were wrong.
Thank you.
You changed it, didn't you?
How are you feeling?
It's snack time!
It'd be bad if I woke her up.
I'm glad that I was able to talk to Futami-san.
On that rainy day, Mao-neechan...
Why?
That's true, but...
So, if you ever want to talk to Kai-san again,
So, you...
and runs towards you.
and blue sky,
Its my first time having these feelings.
be10But try to think about this:
be10Yes, the truth is these barriers were made
How's your cold?
Hey...
Sanada-kun!
Morning!
Aren't Aihara-kun and the others with you?
Hey, stick to him more!
Silence!
Wait, I have a soccer match at twelve.
Is she serious?
Student 9, Sanada Kouichi.
You'll be supervising from eleven to twelve, all right?
I have to study, though.
Please tell me all about making udon, okay?
Let's go.
Our audience will depend on whether our class will be close to the entrance or not.
Hurry!
I'll wait for you.
Since when have you liked me?
You said that,
Movie Research Club?
It's unfortunate, but not yet.
looking at it from a historical standpoint,
It's going to take long. Yeah, sorry.
That's enough already!
Wait for me!
If I knew I was going to suffer this much, I'd rather had been alone!
I love you, too.
I'm so moved!
Yeah, I'm fine.
Mizusawa?
It's not like that.
So, you won't ask anything.
Kai-kun...
Love won't be born from an experiment.
Sorry about yesterday.
What's it called? Becoming the role?
W-What are you saying?
All right, that's enough.
What did she mean?
I... like...
Stop.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, Sanada-kun.
Can we hold hands?
What, Hiiragi?
I thought I'd tell you what you're missing.
We're going to research the new udon we'll be putting out for the school festival!
Is there anything else?
Please answer it clearly!
I'd forget how lame I was...
W-What's wrong, Futami-san?
She's moving out of this house.
KISS! KISS! Im in love.
Barely in sight,
be10We might be separated someday
be10so that everyone can cross them
Well, it's something like a handmade game center, I guess.
Good morning!
It's the dashi we stayed up all night to make.
See you later, Asuka-sempai!
Thanks.
I-I see.
I've seen this movie before!
Please try this!
Ah, that's a good idea!
No way, it won't look good on me.
Or maybe not!
You're really good at drawing, Kai-kun!
That doesn't matter!
Yeah.
If that's not it, then what is it?
Just kidding.
She spaces out during practice and makes a lot of mistakes.
Oh yeah, we haven't decided where we're going yet, right?
She's moving tomorrow, right?
Mao-neechan?!
I said that, too, but she said that it was okay.
She must have things she doesn't want to show.
I'm moving, but it's within walking distance.
Yeah.
Ah, that's right.
I made a mistake since I used it for half a year.
It's all right, there's no need for me to keep it anymore.
It'd be nice if we could have fun like we did in the past.
Under this bright sunlight,
and blue sky,
be10But try to think about this:
be10There's always someone thinking of you
be10So try to smile
It came really fast.
The truth is, I have to do the class reception in the morning.
I'm really sorry, the match will be done at two.
A university is a place where you face what you want to do.
Oh yeah, Mao-neechan...
Moved already?
Let's see, perhaps fifty would be-
Are that many people going to come?
I have something to talk-
Hey, come help the class, too!
That's right.
Don't push yourself too much.
Ah, s-sorry.
What's up with you?
Excuse me.
A lot of things happened lately, like my moving,
You're right.
so we'll meet up at Satonaka's.
Please.
What's all this...
It'd show on Aiihara's face, too.
Oh! Juliet!
Sorry.
Ah, no, it's nothing.
Please come by and eat it, you two.
Ah, that's right.
Give this book to me, then.
Okay, that's a promise!

Give it up!
Are you awake now?
Let's go.
Welcome!
I'm glad you got your grandfather's approval.
You were able to return to the basics.
I'm really happy for you.
Good job.
I have to patrol for my public morals duty.
You two get to walk around the school festival together,
We've got to go cheer now.
I see.
Excuse me.
Two, please.
Asuka-sempai! move me down
Kuryuu-san...
Are you patrolling?
I guess public morals duty must be tough.
We're the Movie Research Club!
Nice cut!
Asuka turn!
Aihara-kun...
Thank you very much!
I'll also be the coach.
I need to talk to you.
It was worth it for Kazuki to work hard.
Sorry, I was spacing out.
What did you want to talk about?
You don't need to worry then, I know you can do it!
Sorry for suddenly bringing this up.
This is an announcement from the School Festival Executive Committee.

The number you have dialed is either out of range or out of bat-
No, I'll do that later.
She's not here either?
Kazuki, I saw your match.
Eri-chan? No, I haven't, why?
We were supposed to meet, but she didn't show up.
Could it be a date?
Pretty good, Kazuki.
Yes.
I'm sure that he really cares for you.
So I guess it's about time I graduated from being their big sister.
Baton pass.
Bye.

I guess I said some unnecessary things, sorry.

Love comes in many shapes,
but it's still wonderful.
Huh? Aren't we out of udon, Naru-chan?
Don't get carried away just because I helped you.
Fine, I don't mind.
You're going to go see the campfire, right?
Hey wait!
Seeing you hesitate just because you have homework seemed like a lie.
I have to work.
That band from before invited me.
I looked for you here once,

It's okay to hurt me.

It's a wig, I tell you.
You're going home now?
I brought some customers!
Yeah. Well, no, I'm not seriously trying to become one or anything.

What are we going to do?
Would you be willing to... 
Forget it.
I'm looking for a quality, charming person.
Morning.
No, no one.
It hurts.
Yes.
Here you go.
That's quite arrogant of you.
I can't expect much from Aihara and Sanada.
Yes.
I'm becoming quite the busy guy!
What kind of person is she?
Please, come in. 
What is it?
I thought so.
We're counting on you.
What? It didn't work out?
I'd like you to come tomorrow too...  i r pro, do not touch these lines

I'm part of the Public Morals Committee, so of course.
Just having someone to like makes even your empty mornings feel great.
You can't be making that kind of movie!
Everyone is different.
It's a real shame since you're so cute, Kuryuu-san.
Once you dress up, you can have more confidence in yourself.
Are you going to practice now, Sakino-san?
Maybe this is a bit childish.
And beside his, I would then make my own.
And then, I would catch a cold from leaving the window open the whole time.
If, for argument's sake, that I would happen to go out with a boy,
It is red.
I dropped it earlier.
It'd be a problem if you lost it, right?
Thanks, you're a life saver.
Shaolin Dragon!
There were so many people too!
Yeah...
You're helping out too.
So, about the movie...
Did you find anything good?
We can go anytime.
Ah, no, um...
But still, I have no idea how it'll feel.

This never-ending LOOP,
and blue sky,
KISS! KISS! Im in love.
I am here because of your kiss,
be10So precious that I couldnt touch it.
be10The strange box lying in the corner of the classroom;
be10My insuppressible feelings
be10that wish upon a star.
Good morning, onii-chan!
I was thinking about something.
Kouichi!
I wonder what Kai-kun's intention was.
I don't know how I should face him.
Mishima-san?
So we meet again.
You can tell by looking, right?
Ah, I'm sorry!
Let's go in.
I'm all stiff!
Shijou-san!
Hey, what's this puru-puru ramen?
Soy milk...
Okay.
Berry-berry?
How unpleasant.
I'm sorry about the other day.
What? Is there something on my face?
That's true!
You just smiled, didn't you?
Could it be...
Then that means...
I'm not sure of my own feelings yet, but...
Is that okay?
No...
If we're going to confirm her bad taste, we should go to a good store.
You're right, I had thought it was natural.
What about you, Yuumi-san?
What am I doing?
All right!
His name is Kouichi.
It's quite a surprise to find out that Futami-san has bad taste, though.
She has her preferences, too.
You're quite harsh.
But, but I'm worried!grammar
Me too.
Mao-neechan...
Then what's your opinion on this?
Yeah, yeah!
Hold on, what are you saying, Hiiragi?!
It's okay.
Ah, tomorrow is the swimming tournament, isn't it?
Look, look! What do you think?
so I need these.
ask her if you can take a picture with your phone to gather data.
Ah, no, we won't take pictures secretly.
Good luck!
I was in a panic, so I went like this.
No, it's nothing like that!
We need Asuka-sempai after all!
for all those participating in the mixed relay, please gather around the start line.
does that mean we'll win?
Let's go tell the teacher we'll forfeit this match.
She really won...
What about you, Sanada?
That's fine then.
Could it be you...
No matter what it is, I want to hear about it.
I'm scared.
I heard they get lots of celebrities.
Morning, Kuronuma.
He doesn't treat me differently!
Everyone? Then that means...
I wonder if Sadako's coming.
N-No one wants to.
Oh, sure.
I don't have much to do during the summer.
More like, he's made of cool.
Hey,
He took me seriously.
I never didn't want to.
I wanted to fit in with everyone.
Thanks, Kazehaya-kun.
We've got almost everyone.
W-What are you doing...
It's sort of nice.
But What about the test of courage?
That's good.
I It's thanks to you.
He might not say good morning to me.
H-Hey...
It's true that I was attracted by his kindness,
It's hard to approach people,
Do you have any spare clothes?
You're going to need more than a hanky, aren't you?
Tha Thanks.
Kazehaya?
I tend to be pretty mindless sometimes.
Are you having milk?
I saw a dog today, an abandoned one.
Over here!
It's fine, I've built up immunity.
Oh yeah, don't they say dogs get attached to their owner when they're friendly with each other?
Yeah, go for it.
Morning.
I still haven't chosen a name though.
Next time...
Didn't Ueda's grades drop? He was beside Sadako.
Is it just me or is everyone watching me?
It sort of sucks that I have no one to share my joy and sadness with at times like this.
Do you want this?
It's fine, I'm sorry.
12, 19, 25.
By the window, at the back.
Want some?
I'm hungry.
I got this seat.
from the bottom of my heart!
Aren't they together a lot lately?
So I can at least listen to you.
This is the part where you're supposed to know your place and back off.
Because he talked to you?
M-Maybe?
It doesn't even have to be Kazehaya, as long as they're nice to you, does it?
I never knew it was so tough being popular.
You wouldn't understand!
Definitely.
Yeah, we can.
You've sure made some ground.
I feel like I'm part of the class.
Do I feel this way because he helps me?
Yeah, she is.
Sa
I-I kicked it.
Kazehaya.
We're going to go strategize before the game.
Your elbow hurts.
And red.
I sort of got carried away.
Okay.
You'll see.
I think I went too far yesterday.
I'm in her diary.
What kind of response is that?
But it's cute.
It doesn't suit me.
Why do I have to watch the game with you?
Kurumi-chan's watching.
Shut up, I have my own problems.
Hey, Kurumi-chan.
She tells me what she's really thinking now.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Dark water in a swamp...
Next episode: Romance
The same?
The game's starting, Kurumi-chan.
I think I really don't know anything.
Kurumi-chan never came back.
I'm just happy.
I know, but...
Name?
What's up with her?
What's with that crazy smile?
Hey, it's Kurumi-chan.
Of course not.
I never believed it in the first place.
I just miscalculated a little.
And there's something I want to find out.
I'm confused, but
Sure, of course.
S-Sanada-kun...
Eh? I'm here?
I doubt that ball had that much force.
Oh yeah, I wanted to talk to you.
Nothing.
She said no way when I asked her if she wanted to go out with you.
You see...
Yeah, about that,
I couldn't take it anymore.
I got worried.
My body...
I'm shaking.
Like...
It's not?
I'm going to believe you.
Wait, but, as a person,
And I wanted to be the one helping you.
Selfish or self-centered, do anything for me or don't,
So wait, if she likes Kazehaya, then why would she help out someone who likes him?
She called me out.
I don't think this is from her, though.
I should have gone after him and interrupted.
I know.
That's not
It was like, by the time we knew, everyone was talking about it.
Yeah.
and to be able to tell people about it,
Damn, it's like a samurai drama!
We asked everyone in the school.
Go, Chizu!
So?
B-But this is your writing!
No, we were hanging her.
Rebel! Rebel Sawako!
but I'm spreading slander about them...
No, Kurumi's not stupid
You might give people the wrong idea, saying that.
You were in the way.
You piss me off with what you did, but whatever.
And don't ever make Sawako cry ever again!
I want to live like you.
And don't take advantage of people either.
She's not awesome anymore.
Why should I have to?
but really?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
We seriously don't think anything of the rumors.
I can tell them what I'm really thinking.
Kuronuma Sawako-chan, right?
You're the only person I've ever told.
There was something I wanted to tell her.
I just met her,
Should we interject?
That's a little weird.
What, are you here to laugh?
Still have more complaints?
I love him.
When you put it into words
Why did you come back?
Next episode: Rival
Because you are.
I won't curse you.
Him? Me?
Who knows! Who knows what could have happened in that situation.
But now it's too late.
Right?
Kurumi-chan...
There's no one you like?
Hey, you're still here.
Really?
Here it is, I knew it.
He sees me for who I am.T: an evil scheming bitch? nay.
Later.
No!
Sorry.
You're never going to meet anyone as cute as I am.
What? Kazehaya?
Like someone your own age next time.
You sure are having fun.
I never told anyone how much I liked him.
I hate any woman that Kazehaya likes.
I know, I was pissed too.
Okay, let's head home and party at six.
Okay.
Kuronuma?
Yeah.
Geez, she's pretty creepy.
Kazehaya-kun is the exact opposite of me.
Kazehaya is, yeah.
Um...
Yay, I'm next to you.
...so glad I got this seat.
Yano-san and Yoshida-san, was it?
Those black rumors about Yano and Yoshida are really something though.
I'm going to hurt them again if I stay near them.
If you don't hate me, why are you avoiding me?
I can't say it.
So you were being awkward because of the rumors about Yano and Yoshida.
No way.
Grow up.
Kazehaya was watching her back.
She has to make use of it.
I made a new friend again.
Because he was nice to you?
It doesn't even have to be Kazehaya, as long as they're nice to you, does it?
So that's what she was trying to do.
Like?
Like!
Get him to feel sorry for you again.
Checkmate.
I said you're in my way.
I swear.
I know he doesn't like me.
I can't make myself think of anyone else more than her.
Thanks.
Places that I'll remember.
I begin my weekends by feeding the birds.
How many piercings does she have?!
Well well, don't just stand at the door, do come in.
That's perfect then. Here, a gift.
Look through them more.
Is that so?
Nope.
Oh yeah, Chizuru said she's going to Kuronuma's place today.
She's so kind.
Just leave those there.
To banish the spirits?
I'll do it.
Why am I acting like his boyfriend?
Do it.
He opens the door, but there's no one there.
I've infringed on your privacy.
You're awesome!
Take care.
Walk her home, Kazehaya.
Pedro!
Arai-sensei told me to hold on to you and close my eyes for five seconds when I want to thank you.
Did I scare you?
You didn't notice?
Sure, I guess.
I don't talk in my sleep.
Anything other than a shoulder massage coupon.
What the...
That's good.
Do you believe in destiny?
Stand!
Shoulder massage coupon?
I can't get him new mitts, but a glove pouch...
That was an impulsive buy.
Should I not?
Yeah.
Why?
But it sort of sucks that I don't get to meet him often.
But I just know he'll be back for New Year's.
Go!
How's this?
Morning, Ryu.
Morning.
Hey Kazehaya, what do you think of this?
I can tell.
After what I told you? How?
Sounds good.
That was close.
Well, damn.
I was always busy just trying to talk to people.
Morning.
What, why?
I was going to go to Ryu's place.
He almost saw this.
Why would he get upset over that?
Yano-chin, I love you.
What's going on?
Two people get dumped and comfort each other, then fall in love...
Nope.
It's so strange.
A laid back, easy going, mature guy.
Could that be...
G-Good evening.
I've loved her like a little sister since she was young.
I'm not really family or a relative or anything, but yeah.
Let's all go.
Shouta, what do you think?
It's not your fault, cheer up.
I'm not upset or anything.
About Tohru.
She's already up.
Of all times, this time I had nothing to say.
Bugs!
I wonder if she gave it to him.
Chi never showed up again.
You baseball nut!
What's baseball got to do with anything?
Without a speck of disappointment?
I know. I know, Sawako.
Ah.
Ayane-chan!
What about you? What would you do?
Me?
Loser?
Morning, Kazehaya.
I'll go buy bread.
Sorry, you wouldn't even look at me.
I couldn't go.
How could I eat all this?
Why are you here?
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
What the hell?
What do you mean it's hopeless?
I wanted to be happier when I gave it to him.
When else are you going to vent?
Ryu's totally being an asshole.
What?
Seriously, I get fat when I hang out with you.
Smile, if you're happy.
You definitely look gloomy.
Hey,
Oh yeah, Zen mentioned...
But it would be a good rumor if Pin survives.
That's true.
Why?
And he's always the leader amongst the guys.
And popular with the girls.
He was a good person in middle school too.
Because of that there's a lot of girls from our middle school here.
Kuronuma.
everyone's going to know everything about your embarrassing past.
I'm out.
Kazehaya-kun was here, so...
Why don't you come inside? Don't just stand out here.
and things are slowly changing around me.
You idiot!
I think she's trying to say that it's because you worked so hard.
My baiting plan is a success!
This one and this one.
You're good at teaching.
See, like this.
Thanks.
I was a bit bummed.
...to myself.
No way, that's insane.
She still wouldn't talk to Sanada-kun,
Not that I could have talked to him the way I was, of course.
Oh, she's kidding.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
How about work?
I worked hard today.
Tireless as always.
Oh well.
My poor thighs.
Why?
Welcome.
A meat bun, or a bean paste bun.
which star is that?
But there's a lot of happy things too.
She seemed like a mellow, cute girl.
Chi.
Tohru,
Maybe even cuter than Ryu.
I walked her home, don't worry.
You heading home?
From yesterday.
Neither of you are exactly smooth talkers.
Good luck.
Thanks, Ryu-chan.
Sorry.
This'll mean review sessions!
Why me?
Is Sadako praying?
Who knows, I might not either.
I can go.
You haven't signed up yet?
Maybe I can just make one.
Okay.
Dad, welcome home.
Santa said he's going to spend a lot this year.
You gotta write it down and hang it up.
Not that I'm complaining about your cooking, Mom.
You know, you were supposed to be born on the 24th.
We were worried because your mother didn't go into labor.
but to us, you're a Christmas present.
Can't you come just for a little bit?
Did you make them yourself?
Sawako's dad is really hyped up about Christmas.
Yeah.
The water's ready.
It does, right?
You remembered I said my head's cold.
Thanks, Sawako. Merry Christmas.
Hello?
It's you, right?
Good evening.
But...
I want to go!
Give me.
I can't let you ruin it with your antics.
M-Morning.
Yeah right.
If you don't mind, could you give it to your dad or mom or grandpa
Morning!
Why don't we have a worship your new teacher, Pin party then?
There was really so much that happened.
I won't see him after this, until the third semester.
I had a lot of fun.
See you next year.
Thank you.
Do you think we could meet over the winter holiday too?
When you're bored.
You scared me, why would you bring that up now?
We can get in contact easier now too.
With Chizu-chan and Ayane-chan? Sounds good.
Was it that bad yesterday?
You do now.
I'm not forcing you.
Just if you want to see him.
Hello? It's Kuronuma.
It'll be nice if I can see him.
I get to see him.
Okay, thanks.
Is he upset?
Words woven
Next episode: Birthday
You wished you were cute when you met Kurumi, didn't you?
Let's go.
Sure.
She says she's sorry she can't make it.
This is getting fun.
Look at it burn!
Sweet sake...
Wait, Sawako and Kazehaya are...
Shit, hurry.
You're seeing things.
She's holding my arm.
Would you like some?
Sweet sake, anyone?
She misunderstood.
I'm so embarrassed.
But that's my d-dad's
I wish I'd forced it out of you if I had to.
in the Sumire and Suzuran groups.
I wonder if I'm bragging.
Take...
But since we met,
In ninth grade I applied for Kitahoro High School, since it was nearby.
This year was too different for me.
Sorry, I guess that was boring.
I'll try to have a different vibe next year.
Kuronuma!
Maybe I've changed.
Ayane-chan, there's only one answer to that.
But now we're alone.
Oh yeah, I did.
They beat me to texting her.
I'll come over.
Beware of your temper; be composed and approach everything with calmness.
Maybe Fair.
I've always had good luck.
How did I see him only with admiration all that time?
Finally found you.
You're not getting any new year's allowance.
Thank god!
They're getting along well.
Don't look him in the face.
We finally meet!
Dammit, stop getting led on.
Be safe.
Relationships  Offer your love. Happiness awaits.
Misfortunes come to haunt you in seven days, right?
I just want to be friendly.
Seriously? Hirano-san... Endou-san...
Oh, you walking to school?
Hey.
U-Umm...
I'm going to put up this sign-up sheet on the board, so be sure to sign up if you want to attend.
No way...
I don't think it's right to give her all the jobs people don't want to do.
Umm...
I don't really have anything planned for the summer, so I'll be bored.
I live close by, and I'll be really bored.
Sadako!
Speak for yourself.
Your name is Kuronuma Sawako, right?
And the first time anyone's made me feel this way...
Umm...
You don't need to force yourself.
I've always just wanted to get along with everyone, but I haven't been doing those chores because I didn't want to do them.
It's just that it makes me happy if I could be of some use...
No.
Don't you agree, Chizu?
We're counting on you to put on the best ghost act of all time, Sadako!
Oh, Sadako is actually-
I think they liked it!
I'm actually being useful to everyone!
What the heck...
If you guys knew about this, you should've told me.
Cut it out already!
Here, drink up.
Really?
I got too carried away...
But the thing is, it really won't cause misfortune or anything-
Summer break!
Well then, let's announce the results of the test of courage before we head out.
I bet she was making a move on you.
You can't stand up for me...
Kazehaya-kun... your reputation will be...
But it's true I was attracted to Kazehaya-kun's kindness, liveliness, cheerfulness...
Even so, I'm lonely.
Is it all right if I expect...
Kimi ni Todoke
My nickname is Sadako.
Kazehaya?!
Oh, it's probably because I talked to them out of the blue.
She's praying.
And why is she soaked?
but I hope I'll be able to break down these walls one at a time.
Sadako, don't you have any spare clothes?!
Tadaa!
T-Th-Thank you!
I find it hard to interact with people, but today...
I know you feel bad about rejecting her, but..
...that we'll see each other over the summer, too?
No-
You won't avoid me even if we see each other there?
Those feelings of respect have grown greater and greater!
What are you talking about? I don't get it at all.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known who it was from.
You would?!
Used to it?
Oh yeah, don't people say that dogs start to like people if they're friendly with their owners?
It's really strange...
For some reason, I don't feel...
I guess I'll wait until after school to give it to them.
Oh, you have math during first period?
Hey, that seat is open.
What, the one in the front?
Wow, so Kazehaya-kun is somewhere over there... Please! This is the only thing I'll ever ask of you!
But... there's no helping it.
You can have this back.
Thanks.
Morning, Sadako.
Same.
I still can't come up with a good name for the dog.
Pedro Martinez...
Huh?!
So he was a nice guy back during middle school, too!
...the "Kazehaya Belongs to Everyone" agreement.
He leaves impressions on people, moves them, and eventually causes them to act.
Yeah, like her.
I need someone to stay after school to make the attendance log.
I'll... do it...
Yeah, I'll help out, too.
That word just came right out.
Maybe everyone else is waiting for the right opportunity to get to know you, too.
Thank-
We were kind of interested.
Why are you just standing there? Go in.
That made you happy?
But... if that was really true...
Seriously?!
I killed a bug.
He was going for that?
He responded to me!
Wow, that's amazing!
Oh, this "nani" is...
And these two sentences are connected.
This and that.
Hey...
Could you tutor us again, Kuronuma-san?
So... I know you're probably tired of hearing this, but...
Wow, that's the first time I've ever seen Sadako smile like that.
Oh my gosh! That's incredible!
Next time: Rumors.
Sawako, hurry up and take a bath!
My Sawako...
Look what you've done, Dear! What is wrong with you?! My Sawako...
I heard that she was practically uncontrollable during middle school.
So she wasn't just sleeping around, huh?
And my eyes aren't as small as everyone thinks they are.
That's just insane!
Right, so that ramen was like...
Hey... Yano-san?
Me, too!
Awesome!
G-Good morning, Sanada-kun.
Pin!
And those guys are really smart, too.
So, how is she?
...hook up with her or something?
W-What are you blushing for?
D-Don't tell me you actually...
For real?
And hear this!
Oh, I missed it...
A lot of people have been talking about you two.
Someone was saying you knocked over an old man and made him bleed, Yoshida-san.
Huh?!
And Yano-san, they were saying that you work as a prostitute...
I see.
I feel like you've softened up, Sadako.
We've yet to ask Sadako what she meant by that.
How do you feel about us?
It's cool.
I should be really happy, but...
It's... because of me?
If I talk to Kazehaya-kun, will I end up hurting him the same way I did Yano-san and Yoshida-san?
Huh? I've actually seen them before.
Could it be that she was apologizing for yesterday... for not liking us?
They're hurt far more than I thought they were.
I want them to return to the way they normally are.
Kuronuma!
Did I do something to make you sad... or to even make you hate me?
What am I...
I-It's nothing!
Yano-san, Yoshida-san, and Kazehaya-kun have never appeared to be disgusted or frightened of me.
Even if it always ended up with her killing the mood, she's always greeted everyone.
But today, she just sat down in her seat without looking at anyone... not even me.
Now that I'm so far away from where I usually sit, it feels like I never sat there in the first place.
But... I still haven't been able to clear up the misunderstanding between Yano-san, Yoshida-san and me.
Hurting such kind people...
...how it feels to be treated kindly, and the feeling of wanting to return the kindness...
You were waiting for me at this very place on the first day of summer vacation.
I'm still not convinced.
I'm sorry if I'm making you lose your popularity!
I've... always been longing for people like this...
Have you calmed down a bit?
Then I guess I'll keep this.
Huh?
If I hadn't shown up, then what?
Hey! Don't be blaming others.
I don't know what you're talking about, but blaming things on others doesn't solve anything.
Why are they all Japanese ghost stories?
She's such a strange girl...
You're not feeling down because of those rumors about you being a delinquent, are you?
Thought so.
If she did that, the rumors would be about her muttering to herself!
Well, I mean, she doesn't seem like she has people to talk to.
Simpleton.
That was a shocker!
Stop crying. You're embarrassing me.
If we'd stuck around to listen, I wonder what she would've said.
Hey... is it just me, or do you hear a voice coming from that stall? "I-I'm sorry to be a bother, but..."
Oh my gosh! Quit scaring me!
Don't forget, you already have someone you can talk to, too.
I'm sure they will.
Man, I'm so screwed for today's test!
Rumors?
Yano-san and Yoshida-san aren't backing me up or anything.
And I'm a slut, and I did a hundred guys in middle school.
You're both so amazing.
I'll be happy to use it.
Could you please give me some recommendations?
Hey, Yoshida,
Little old man.
Round and round, round and round.
Is she cursed or
She's normal, I think?
I never even thought about it.
No way!
I can understand the rumors about us,
Wait, go on...
They're not friends.
More like
I wonder if there's something I can do to cheer them up.
Those black rumors about Yano and Yoshida are really something though.
Backing me up?
Yup.
They're approaching me in kindness.
It's because she's wandering around.
Yeah.
You're shitting me.
Yano-chin,
You asked if she liked us, after all.
That's what you hoped, right?
I upset you, didn't I?
Sadako!
Were you crying earlier?
I don't know.
Next episode: Decisions
Hey, Sadako!
"Sadako"?
Do you remember the rumors about Sadako?
Morning, Ryu!
What are you yelling for?
Move it! Move it!
Yano-san and Yoshida-san aren't like that at all!
You'll hurt their feelings if you say things like that about them!
W-Why would I ever say something bad about them?!
If you do that, we promise to leave you alone-
So... please. Take back what you said earlier.
...don't know anything.
That smells...
So...
You think you can beat me in a fight?
Geez, you're so annoying!
They realized none of the rumors were true!
in my heart, a part of me had already given up.
But even then, you wanted to be with us...
Please, don't get used to being alone again!
Friends?
What's going on?
Where is it?!
Pin totally ruined the moment.
Thank you, Kazehaya-kun.
Hey, Sadako was...
Sign: Kuronuma Sawako
and I noticed that my grades had dropped quite a bit. Sign: Kuronuma Sawako
You should be fine, then.
What's wrong, Kazehaya?
Want me to take you to the nurse's office?
I'm so happy for you!
Your dearest wish came true! You were able to become friends with them!
Yeah!
Okay!
Huh?
And... there. Done.
Yup!
O-Oh, but I haven't served the curry!
I can do that myself! Don't worry about it!
Okay!
Oh yeah, we don't know your cellphone number yet.
I can never turn you down.
I've always wanted you to try out the ramen here! Here you go.
I recommend miso ramen.
You really serve the best ramen in town, pops!
Sure. Enjoy your stay.
Come on, no need to sit so formally.
Huh? They're girls.
It isn't weird; it's amazing!
It's my room, after all.
Hey! Don't confirm it!
He'll be expecting to talk to Ryu, but then he'll find himself talking to a girl! It'll give him a scare!
Let me talk to Ryu, too!
I-Is this Kazehaya-kun?
This is Kuronuma speaking.
What?!
He looks a little young.
See? This is the way he is.
This is a side of Kazehaya-kun I don't know...
I wonder if he studied really hard...
What do you think of her, Ryu?
Not really my type.
L-Love!
Who knows?
Sadako! That's-
I'm neither perverted nor emo!
You really feel like a girl!
Playtime's over!
There's a tiny old man at my house, too...
I knew it...
It's time for you kids to leave!
Everyone's smiling; that made me so happy...
The school where everyone is.
That includes me, too... right?
That's a bit of an overstatement.
By seeing his middle school pictures...
Kurumi!
Why not? You two are really close.
Like this?!
Oh, that?
Good luck?!
That's great!
Morning. Morning.
Why, thank you so much for deciding for me.
A-A-A-A-A-
It makes me happy.
For Kuronuma to just call me "Kazehaya".
I don't know how to explain it...
You'd better do a fine job!
I know! I'll put effort into it.
We don't have enough people, so those who are good at sports have to participate in two events.
I'll mark you down as excused!
Roger that!
Let's do this.
It's all yours, Sadako!
More like, we'll be blessed with good luck and end up winning the championship!
I need to get a soccer ball...
What are you mumbling about? I have to practice on my own...
What are you mumbling about?
Sadako's chanting something! I need to get a soccer ball...
Right.
Hanging out with you makes me fat.
N-No, I'll be fine today.
Okay!
What? You want to borrow a soccer ball?
I'll use my New Years money.
Thanks for that CD, by the way.
Sorry, what were you saying?
Wait, what time was that chime supposed to signal?
I wonder why...
Next time: A New Friend.
The ball actually came to me!
Nice shot!
It was so hot today!
I guess no one's back yet.
I mean... Kurumi-san!
She's so nice!
You're Kuronuma Sawako-chan, right?
Huh?!
No... I don't think so.
Oh, really?
Oh, so Kurumi-san is a committee member, too.
Oh, that's right!
I'll try calling her "Kurumi-chan".
What?! Why?
It feels like...
There's actually something I want to borrow from you, too.
She's right... There's actually something I want to borrow from you, too.
Oh, right! The album!
Geez!
I do like girly things.
I wanted to do the best I could...
T-Tomo-chan...
I'm waiting for them.
They said Arai-sensei may be willing to lend us one.
Wait, but I thought Ayane-chan was participating in the volleyball match with you.
Oh, right. You're really involved, aren't you?
Yeah. Kurumi.
There's no way I could do that!
W-What is it?
Hey, it's Kurumi-chan.
Wow! Look at all that sweat, Sawako-chan!
G-Got it!
...you need to move like this.
Sawako-chan!
Wait, what was that about?
Bye-bye...
It'd piss me off if she became friendlier with her than us!
Can't you tell?
Wow, you actually remembered?
K-Kurumi-chan...
So I was right!
Even if he's talking to you, I'm sure he'll treat you like everyone else.
I get it!
Kazehaya and I have a lot in common, after all.
Yeah...
You're reliable as always!
Chizu-chan, could you take care of her, too?
So you were on her side all along, Chizu?
...if none of you confessed your feelings for him!
I really don't want to have anything to do with her!
Got it!
Okay!
That's all!
Really?
Want to come see him next time?
Sawako-chan!
So her name is Ume-chan.
Wow... for a second there, I thought I made her mad by being overly familiar.
It's not a matter of whether you can handle it.
I'm... going to help make that happen?
I don't think... I can do this...
Or...
Kazehaya-kun must be special to her, just like how he is to me.
So... if you ever want to talk, I'll always be there to listen-
N-No!
I wouldn't even dream of it!
Then what makes him "special" to you?!
Or maybe because he was friendly to you?!
So as long as someone's kind to you, it doesn't have to be Kazehaya, right?!
I-I didn't know...
No, I was just...
So if someone other than Kazehaya-kun is nice to me...
You bet!
Me, too!
We can!
There she goes!
Ouch.
We'll win this.
I was the MVP!
I'll come watch your volleyball game, too!
Good luck!
Lose what? A cheering war?
Don't worry about it.
Don't you dare... call me that anymore.
Would that be the normal reaction here?
No, you're Sawako!
Of...
...but she's still adorable.
When I'm with you, I always get irritated and end up revealing my true self.
Nothing...
We'll be fine.
There are a lot of girls watching!
I have so much more respect for her now!
Kuronuma Sadako.
No... Chizuru made me memorize it the other day...
If I recall...
"Numa"...
Wait, was it Doronuma?
You want to pair up, Shota?
It's almost like it overheard our conversation.
In other words, I used to think of Kazehaya-kun that way...
Kazehaya-kun.
Take this special curve ball!
Hey!
He saved you, didn't he.
The game!
On rainy days?!
That was close!
It's not like I just met him yesterday or anything.
I want to know more about Kazehaya-kun and my own feelings.
I'm going to be doing things my own way.
I really want to go out with him.
Thanks for the match!
We cleared the first round!
It's hard to spot you with that hair.
Come on, let's go.
I would have never known how nice these people were.
Wouldn't that put him on the same level as Kazehaya?
I wonder who's playing next.
I only got that because I was nearby.
Just tell me.
You went to the same middle school as Chizu, righ-
The expensive ones my sister bought!
I'm surprised you know my name.
...most of Chizu's rumors were real, but heavily exaggerated.
Well, good luck to you.
Did you see me?
Sanada-kun saved me from getting hit by a ball earlier, so I want to go thank him.
So even Ryu does something nice every now and then.
Umm...
Y-You're still willing to talk to me!
Kuro-
Umm... thank you for saving my life earlier.
Do you happen to know what romantic feelings are like?
And she wasn't even watching you earlier.
Her eyes were on Sanada, and Sanada only.
I can't even compare her to anyone else.
But... if I stayed true to my heart...
Well, whatever.
I-It's not fair, Yano-chin!
Hang on, why would Kurumi do that?
I'm just asking for the sake of it.
Well... this is just a hunch, but...
Could it be that Kurumi is in love with Ryu?
...like Ryu?
Like?
I like Kazehaya-kun so much...
M-My feelings towards Sanada-kun aren't anything romantic.
Really?
Did I... just say something really rude to Sanada-kun?!
Geez...
Huh?
Huh? Going where?
If she really likes Kazehaya, why did she help out all those girls who liked him, too?
And that's why she helped rivals who didn't stand a chance.
It's not fair, Yano-chin! You know all these things I don't!
Precisely.
Ka?
Why are you fidgeting like that?
What did you say?
Just deal with it and go after someone your own age.
Yeah.
We can confront her now, Yano-chin!
What? Is this getting personal?
Hey... there's someone I like.
W-What's she doing? And... it's kind of embarrassing...
I want to tell Kurumi-chan.
Mind shutting your mouth for just a bit?
B-But, this is your handwriting!
Seriously?
Besides, what would Kurumi-chan get from spreading those rumors...
According to the rumors, I was having you two as my henchmen...
It just means...
N-No! Kurumi-chan is really smart!
This is so confusing!
Quit calling me an idiot!
S-Sawako?!
I'm going to say what's on my mind!
S-Sure...
I don't even care if you apologize or not!
...you play dirty, Sawako-chan.
What?
And you can earn his sympathy again.
Please don't tell Kazehaya-kun about it.
Sorry... about earlier.
What do you mean by that, anyway?
So I have people to tell how I really feel.
She told me we were friends.
Even if those were lies,
These feelings that mean so much to me.
What?
...while she still has feelings for me.
Did you come here to give a complaint you forgot earlier?
Hurry up and say it, then.
I'm so much more...
But... that doesn't matter at all.
Because... I've always been watching him.
I... wouldn't have had to cry in front of you!
Because you know so many nice things about Kazehaya-kun.
It's probably because I noticed how cute she is when she's in love with him.
Besides...
It's not dirty.
O-Of course not!
Certainly not!
I can tell.
Sorry about that. I'll definitely be able to play tomorrow.
Yeah!
See you tomorrow!
Oh.
I won't tell anyone.
I... don't want him to have the wrong idea.
You're the last person I'd want...
Sorry, Kurumizawa!
There's someone else I'm in love with.
Could you call me by my name... just this once?
Ume.
Your plan?
I told him...
Why are you playing dumb, Yano-chin?
What made me realize...
I kind of respect her for that. I wouldn't be able to do it.
I might... turn into a demon!
You should treasure your boyfriend more, Yano-chin.
Don't worry about it.
What, your eyes went all puffy after I rejected you?
"Rivals"?
I'm so jealous!
W-What's with her?
After that...
The sports festival came to an end.
Entire class?
I wonder when I started having these feelings...
Where's Kuronuma?
Sawako.
Sawako.
Idle chatter gathers in the middle of the night.
I see...
when I meet Yano-san, Yoshida-san and Kazehaya-kun?
if I stay here, I'm going to end up hurting them again.
So I'm going to go back to what it was like,
All of it.
I've always wanted
I'll keep this, then.
So it's all about how the other person feels.
I don't know how they feel,
I want Yano-san and Yoshida-san to listen to me.
His simple words, his smiles... they always nudge me forward.
Go for it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, but who else would she be talking to?
What did you mean, sorry, Sadako?
Oh my god Sadako, you suck at drawing.
She laughed when we were studying for the exam.
She'd gotten used to being avoided.
She's so nice too.
That's why I couldn't just leave her.
You get used to the attitudes around you,
Is that what you were thinking all this time?
but I guess we were getting upset because we only thought we did.
or not friends,
What do you think she would have said?
Seriously.
I can't know how someone else is feeling unless I ask.
I have someone I can talk to.
Shit, I'm really screwed for the exam today.
I spent too much time here thinking.
Anyway, she's a brave girl.
And her name is also Sadako, like from The Ring.
I hope that someday, I'll be able to act like him.
I just said it!
Heck no!
Kazehaya.
Yoshida, you're up next...
Geez, you're the same as always.
I'm starting to wish I could be more like Sawako-chan!
But it's great...
Th-They're not my friends!
I may be able to clear up the misunderstanding, but I still don't know how I could possibly heal their wounded hearts.
This makes me depressed!!!
Maybe they feel the same way, too.
And just with those words and his smile alone, he gives me the push I need to move forward.
Everything!
...don't know anything.
...no, more than like...
Now run along.
Kurumi!
It wouldn't really surprise me... if Kazehaya fell in love with her.
Huh?
Sawako-chan!
I made a new friend.
Maybe that's how people usually make friends.
I'm really glad you're willing to help!
I can't really support you with all my heart.
So as long as someone's kind to you, it doesn't have to be Kazehaya, right?!
But don't you think Sawako-chan's gotten braver? She refused to help!
She's the one who started those rumors about us.
Sawako.
I thought we were friends...
Sounds like the outcome of the match has been decided.
I... think you're much cuter now...
I'm sorry.
Even if worse comes to worst, and you and Kazehaya do work out,
A place that will exist in my memories forever.
...Chizu-chan and Ayane-chan are coming over.
Are you Sawako's dad?
I can so see the resemblance!
Although she has a lot of make-up on...
Chizu-chan! Ayane-chan!
Seriously?
Don't! You'll get fat!
Why are you two just standing by the door?
And this is my father.
Whoa, what's this? You've got pictures up here!
We're so close together!
Yano-chin took those without anyone knowing.
It's impossible, and besides...
Oh, I rented those movies yesterday.
Pedro...
Looks like Maru really likes you.
Not getting that?
Hey...
Good evening.
Umm... you should wash your hands once you get home...
Will she... go bad?
Oh my! Look at this, Dear!
Thanks for the food!
Oh my! You didn't have to bring those down!
Well, they started telling ghost stories.
I decided to escape for a bit.
Oh.
But I'm a little worried, not to mention Maru's also with me.
We'll be right there.
What do you mean?
On top of all this, I even get to see Kazehaya-kun...
This place is so dirty...
It's a cold.
Think I'll make it through this?
He opens the door each time, but there's no one standing there.
I was bummed that we lost the match.
And Pin was making fun of me.
Yeah, because we cleaned it.
What, you guys were still here?
Go home already!
We're never coming again!
We've been together all day, so it feels a little lonely to say good-bye...
Seriously... if you do it again, you can't blame me if I do something.
If I keep spending time with you...
It really makes me sad that I'll have to leave you soon.
A lot of things happened during the second semester, but there's only a month left.
I just realized that New Years is coming up.
It's really cold this morning, don't you think?
Is the bed hair that obvious?
Even if his hair is sticking up, he looks really cute...
Your boyfriend?
Why is it that those types of men pretend to be generous adults when you first meet them?
I-Is that true...?
No, I think there are a lot of things wrong with this situation.
They're a great match!
...like him...?
But seriously, Chizu-chan...
Yeah, I wish!
That...
Something no more than 500 yen.
It can be anything.
A-Actually, never mind.
It's nothing!
Sawako! Yano-chin!
What? Why?
I'm free.
Great! Great!
Who are you?
What did you get him last year?
What better gift than this?!
That even surprised me.
But right now, I get the feeling it's okay to ask!
I've liked him for a while, but it's one-sided.
He didn't come home for this year's Bon Festival, so I literally haven't seen him for a year.
Y-Yeah.
Does Sanada-kun know about this?
Raise your voice, Sanada!
Same with the rest of you!
I actually can't.
My bro's coming home.
How about something like this?
Yo.
Morning!
Let's see...
I... guess not?
Would you tell her if you were in my shoes?
I guess I would.
Yeah, I knew you'd say that.
Sure, why not?
You think so?
Hey, can we come and see him too?
Sleepover?
Hey!
...is probably because I fell in love with Kazehaya-kun.
A non-fading smile breaks over her face.
Sawako's leaving for her first sleepover!
What should I do?!
Oh!
Yeah.
Anyway, don't visit my place for the next two days.
Make sure you stay away.
W-What's up with him?
Darn that Ryu...!
Let's go play his game, Chizu.
He never said that you couldn't visit today, right?
And while we're at it, apologize and make up with him.
Wow, a defenseless strategy!
I just can't get the proper timing.
She can just see him on New Years.
Why are there so many people here?!
Yano!
We can cheer both Joe and Yano up!
Why did you and your boyfriend break up?
This feels a bit mysterious...
Unexpectedly running across the person you love... Oh yeah, about earlier...
Unexpectedly running across the person you love...
A mature, broad-minded man with a lot of money.
Are you mad about something?
Oh.
Ouch, that was quite an impact.
Well, I was let out early from work today.
So this is the person Chizu-chan is in love with...
Huh?
I'm his little brother.
Her name's Yoshida Chizuru.
I'm not even related to them, but...
I feel like we chose a bad time to visit.
Bye! See ya!
Later!
Chi!
Man, you haven't changed at all.
But hey, it's not your fault. Don't let it get to you.
I think you're still worried about her.
Oops, I won again!
We've been playing cards for four straight hours since then.
Chizu.
Are you okay?
Now that I recall it, I haven't even congratulated him yet.
That's why I'm going to grow up to be one hell of a babe.
Maybe... she didn't actually wake up.
See you guys at school!
She won't even tell us how she really feels.
And even if she did, there's n-
I... couldn't do anything for her...!
We're on the same boat.
Does a mere 'neighbor' have the right to barge in during such a precious day for their family?
Let's fight!
Oww, that hurt!
Tohru!
I don't understand how I thought that was a good way to show my affection.
But...
Whoa!
We'll be back again for New Years.
Chi never showed up after that...
Pick one!
'Considerate'?
If only I was someone like Kazehaya-kun.
I know exactly how you feel, Sawako.
She froze for a second after I said it!
Oh.
Ayane-chan feels the same way I do...
This is why men are...!
I get it now.
Thanks, Kazehaya-kun.
Yano-chin! Sawako!
If Chizu decides to tell us what's on her mind, let's listen to everything she has to say.
All right! Lunch time!
Later.
I... wouldn't know.
Is that how you've always felt?
You were hoping for my heart to be broken?!
I didn't fall in love with him to have my heart broken!
And even then...
And then, you...
We were... kinda worried about you.
I had a little argument with Ryu last night.
I can't take this anymore...!
Chizu!
What's with him?!
S-She's pouting...
Keep complaining!
R-Really?
Okay!
Who's calling?
Nah, I might start getting angry again once I look at his face.
If he hadn't let you take it out on him, you might have not been able to pout and whine.
After getting into an argument with Ryu...
It was a joke...?
'Why'?
I hope Chizu-chan will be able to say whatever is on her mind.
I hope that the next time I see her...
I'll be leaving tonight.
My legs are so sexy, too...
Why?
Anman...!
Anman...!
Man, I really only know Orion, the constellation.
I remember how you tripped over there,
Does he still make you cry?
Really?
It's just that...!
Ryu's a nice guy, after all.
You're still twenty-four.
You're leaving now?
Yesterday.
I'm in the middle of puberty.
I think I might know where she is.
You're the one who called Tohru over, aren't you?
So you always thought I was hopeless in trying to make Tohru look at me?
Next time: Christmas.
Everything's going well.
So it's okay...
I'm allowed...
...to write my name on here.
We're probably going to celebrate Christmas at home too, right?
A Christmas with friends...
You haven't written a letter to Santa this year about what you want, have you, dear?
Why are you asking me, Sawako?
You can bet that I'll be helping you guys out from early in the morning!
Come with me.
Sawako, you were actually due on the 24th.
Huh?!
I-I did.
I guess that was too much...
I got them from Sawako.
Yeah, right...
I made it...
Guess I'll keep Mom and Dad's presents hidden so I can surprise them.
It's a perfect fit!
Sawako!
We were wondering what you were up to.
Hello?
Let's go, Kazehaya!
Both the party and the gift exchange are over...
Th-The thing is...
A-A-A s-stomach band...!
The echoing chimes.
If you're talking to Sawako, she left to get the paper.
Today is the 25th of December.
I got so surprised yesterday!
With every knit I made on it, I thought about my father...
Morning! Morning!
Long time no see, guys!
I've decided to take over my wife's family's sake-brewing business.
No, no, the store is doing very well.
Mr. Arai...
I'll never forget the times I've spent with you all!
Rise!
I thought about and experienced so many things that were new to me.
Hooray!
Where do you want to eat?
He's leaving!
Umm...!
I haven't finished reading the manual yet...
Umm...
TLnote: ... It's better to use a lengthy address, to avoid getting spam.
Huh?!
What?!
I'm going to ask for permission.
If you don't mind, that's fine with us.
H-Huh?
Yoshida, Yano, Ryu, and you're coming too, right?
Wow, that's great!
Of course he'll be looking forward to it.
Now...
We're here!
Sorry to disturb you.
And this pin is from Yano-chin and me.
Looks great!
Don't cry!
That look is even more powerful...
Thank you.
Oh, Ryu won't be coming with you guys either.
Wait-
What are you getting cold feet for?
You invited him yourself!
Let's go.
Thirty minutes until the start of the New Year.
What about Yoshida and Yano?
C-Careful, the steps are made of stone.
Looks like I wasn't even able to see that either!
Th-That's so...!
Huh?
Chizu-chan?
He told me to give you his regards.
I'm pretty sure she's confused about what to do right now.
This is bad!
What about your usual posse?
So, where's Kazehaya?
Sparks...
Now that we're all warmed up, why don't we go and have a chat while sipping on some amazake?
'Couple'?!
Here.
This is so embarrassing!
Yeah?
Oh...
Maybe you would have even used it...
There, sent.
I was able to witness you experiencing something for the first time.
Okay, so tell me in order.
Hey, Zashiki Warashi.
I want some coca-cola, Zashiki Warashi.
I was on the plum team during first and second grade.
What about third and fourth grade?
Bamboo team.
I liked to play jumprope on my own.
I'd fasten a thing of rubber between two chairs, and jump over them.
Playing speed on my own...
We ended up in the same class...
Let's line up for the blessings.
You told us that you wanted to become pretty when you first met Kurumi, right?
You were a lot prettier...
...than I'd imagined you to be.
Until Joe gets tired of Yano-chin, maybe?
Huh?
What?!
I'll treat you to ramen next time!
This jacket was expensive...
Why the heck did you run off on your own like that?!
Things were getting so stupid that I just had to leave.
You look so serious while saying that...
Chi!
Just leave them be.
I don't think you guys need to be that worried.
You're going to come with me to receive blessings.
Three!
Thank you.
Isn't she going to become your new big sis?
If something happens to you, you can count on me to be there to cheer you up.
What did you get, Kuronuma?
Well...
It's so right...
Since they're so rare.
That's... well...
I wouldn't mind even if you did.
Besides...
What is wrong with you?!
Seems like there are idiots everywhere... Just to go out for a little drink!
To hell with marriage!
Don't you get that a lot?
...we'll get to the street that we use to get to and from school.

I want to become one of those paper airplanes filling the sky. sono sora ippai no kamihikouki gurai ni natte Is Sawako still not home yet...?
sono sora ippai no kamihikouki gurai ni natte I want to become one of those paper airplanes filling the sky.
I did too!
G-Good night.
"Classmate".
Morning, Kazehaya.
Something about the rumors about Chizu and Yano-chin.
That stuff about Chizu-san being covered in blood and doing a hundred guys, right?
No, I'm going to try my best to be their friend.
Are you holding something in?
But I can't do anything about it.
Look who's talking!
You're the one spreading rumors about Yoshida and Yano, Sadako.
Me?
You just started hanging out with them to get close to Kazehaya.
Huh? What the hell
You people don't get it.
I love you.
What are you
Mess with Sadako again and I'll mess you up.
Thanks for believing in me.
I'm not pissed off.
I don't know much about Kuronuma.
she was defending Yano-san and Yoshida-san.
Really? Yano and Yoshida helped Sadako?
I thought it was weird.
Oh well.
I kept wanting to fit in with everyone,
Sadako,
I'm embarrassed for having doubted you.
Don't you know? We adore you so much.
Friends?
We were?
Dammit, I'm going to hug you all.
Friends?
I can tell one of those horror stories now.
They switched roles, and now it's solved!
You hear that?
Move!
Get lost, all of you! Like the bugs that you are!
I heard it all along.
Exams ended, and my grades were horrible.
Maybe it's just me,
Let's go eat ramen, Sadako.
I feel like I was just reborn.
Ever since I met you.
He said he hates stupid rumors.
Wait, Yuka.
Of course he's going to hate you for that.
That's unbelievable!
What? No way!
I'm so glad I'm friends with you, Kurumi!
I'm glad we're in the same group!
Hey, let's make sure she never has a chance with a guy she likes.
Oh, I didn't know anyone was here.
I guess I did do a bunch of stuff with him in mind...
We wound up in different classes...
Totally.
So we're together? Glad to have you.
I guess we're both unlucky.
But what kind of girl is she, really? I don't get it.
Didn't we see her with Kazehaya earlier?
It wouldn't surprise me if Kazehaya grew to like her.
What are you saying? You two get along great!
Only because we were in middle school together!
Oh no...
It didn't matter how hard I tried.
That's not truefscx250-
Why can't you just back off?
I'm hearing something from Kurumi-chan's direction!
Ume...
Don't say that you feel the same way I do!
I made sure he never got a girlfriend.
I know that Kazehaya doesn't like me that way.
Why am I crying... l-like this in front of you?
That's because you know all of Kazehaya-kun's good points, Kurumi-chan.
Mm-hmm.
He's popular with both the boys and the girls!
There's a girl I like.
I said it.
Help yourself, Ayane-chan...
It seems like people don't avoid me like they did before.
It's delicious.
It is, isn't it?
Although, if I claimed not to be lonely at all,
Quit it.
Now it's February.
Oh, by the way,
Why are you frozen stiff? You give your papa some every year, don't you?
And you, Chizu?
And those are for Chizu-chan and Sanada-kun... And for Tomo-chan.
Some chocolates for you.
We just saw it!
What?
What a waste!
They weren't meant for confessing anything.
I want to give them to him.
What? A foreign drama?
More importantly, has she given them to him yet? Doesn't look like it.
Sorry, got a date with my girlfriend.
Shouta!
The cups too?
Noo!
It has to be now!
It's Valentine's, so just consider it a keepsake.
Are those for Kazehaya?
You can't mean everybody, can you?
That's that girl from Class D...
Oh, Sadako?
I called it a thank you gift, but I secretly desired more...
I still can't believe everyone's in the same class!
Well, yeah.
How did you knofscx250-
So we do have one!
This is no time to be scared stiff!
You can go ahead without me.
Kazehaya?
Hey, Ryuu!
Probably... real soon.
Remember when I took great pains to ask you?
Ever heard of manners?
I didn't think he would be here!
I'm glad.
His worrying is heartwarming, but it makes me even happier...
Were you waiting for someone?
Kuronuma.
No...
Now there's an unexpected pairing.
Distant, but unchanged.
Hey, Kazehaya!
The problem with only practicing headings...
I must act pleasant and natural!
Hey, Kazehaya!
Good...
Forehead!
Good morning!
It would mean something different between Kazehaya-kun and me.
Maybe to the bathroom.
Yep.
However...
Well, she doesn't hate me.
Are you in some sort of rush?
I told you it's not good for girls to scrunch up their faces.
Kento!
I wouldn't say "cute," more like "interesting."
This will be on the midterm!
Studying hard?
Baseball team.
Can you start from here?
Those two idiots got it right?
She's started to settle into her new class.
What if the girls start picking on her because she's getting all of your attention? Wouldn't that turn her into an outcast?
When I think about her unfulfillable hopes, I just feel heartbroken.
What did he mean by "misunderstand"?
Hey, do you think Kuronuma and I are that different?
Yeah, I'd say you have.
I heard that some of the older players could be overly critical at times.
Did something happen between Sawako and him, or what?
So Sawako-chan held a crash course?
Kento, Kento!
That was what happened, right?
In any case, Sawako, why did you give chocolates to everyone but Kazehaya?
I-I want to thank you for everything.
I'm not avoiding her!
She's used to people avoiding her.
Bye.
Snapped?
All right, then! Why are we keeping this to ourselves?
Then why are you saying that instead of her?
If we tell Kazehaya, he'll think Sawako asked us to do that, which will put her into a steep slump!
For example, let's see...
...Fantasy!
All right, let's vote!
We can... use it for a tea?
Maybe we can fry it overfscx200-
But lately, Kazehaya seems like he's unwilling to make that extra effort...
...is going with you next Sunday, right?
Massage the gel eyeliner into your eyelashes...
Oh?
Yano-chin!
So you need to take advantage of that to highlight how cute you are.
Let me make this clear.
Oh, and thanks for this.
Oh, go ahead without me. I'll go after I drop off these tools.
I rest my case.
Just proclaim your love to her!
Actually, it might be that she knows, and that's what has been irritating her.
I guess I don't know a thing about Kuronuma.
Kuronuma.
You don't have to think of yourself as a class misfit anymore.
I forgot what it was I sought.
That was the side of Kazehaya that I admired, too...
However, for me, that hasn't been enough. Not for a long time.
So you knew it was a mistake?
Kazehaya, you cruel man!
You just need to believe in yourself.
He's gotta be joking!
I'll want to take it the wrong way if you say it like that.
What's so funny?
And who is this guy?
We'll have to continue after school.
Sawako's not back yet?
I'm not who you think I am.
He simply told me what's painfully obvious.
Sadako was crying and Kazehaya looked angry.
Yano-chin, let's go.
So what happened? Don't spare any details.
I can't be the only one who doesn't go.
...would it be a good idea to let people see me?
I-I-I'm sorry!
Ouch! Do you think it's okay to be kicking your teacher?
and that drew out my desires.
You know Kazehaya didn't mean to...
I didn't... but is that true?
That's just her way of being worried.
God! I just went ahead and did it! I'm so stupid!
There, there.
I'm sure Sawako will pull through.
preview
These medicinal herbs seem to have dried out nicely.
Sorry I couldn't help.
Yeah. It seemed like they needed to ask you about something.
I see.
You look terrible.
Hey, get off of me! That's annoying!
Hurt?
I hurt him?
Even Chizu-chan and Ayane-chan felt sorry for you!
Yes, for the costume parade.
Costume?
Actually, I don't care either way. KmE: Pin's my fav character in this series since season 1 lol. At least better than that Kazehaya nigga.
Sure!
You said some crapEditor:crap, perhaps? about not understanding Kuronuma or something.
So just forget about all of that.
I actually told him my feelings.
Sh-She's disgusted with me! Clephas note: 'S-she's disgusted with me!' sounds better to me here...
Sadako-chan!
What do you mean?
Wait, what? KmE: This wasn't in the TL script but I think it's necesarry.
No.
Nothing to worry about.
We'll probably pull an all-nighter the night before.
He didn't even say anything to her as he left.
Am I...
Should I sew itthem up? Should I sew up Edited:that loose trapthose loose lips of yours?
Oh boy...
Oh Kurumi, what did you do after that?
That's right! I interfered! What of it?!
I never thought she was that unworthy of an opponent.
Hey wait!
I expect that group will be able to help the other groups out.
Admirable?
And we have our shifts for the caf...
Come on!
That's a ton of books!
Constipation.
I'm here!
That if Kazehaya were to go out with someone, it wouldn't be you.
But to me it seemed like that was the one boundary where a wall actually existed.
Still, you were much cuter than I took you for.
So I thought, maybe you could give up on Kazehaya, fit into the class, and focus on someone else.
Yeah.
...was always just a boy.
Oh, Sawako! Great job!
We're heading home for some grub, and nice soaks in the tub!
His view from behind, his embarrassed profile, his flustered look,
I want to tell him.
The time has come for me to tell Kazehaya-kun my true feelings.
I'm sorry.
Just one person changed my life.
I love you.
I don't know the right words to say.
So where is he?
There you are, Kazehaya!
Mom, don't let him in!
Hiding something?
That's the heart speaking.
But my mind is clear.
But I haven't served the curry yet.
Oh yeah, this is Ryu's place.
Your ramen's the best, Pops.
It's fine, what are you talking about?
Come on, make yourself comfortable.
Hello?
See you.
Boyfriend?
Grown-up? You can't beat up 99 guys, can you?
It's not half-assed, it's awesome.
What was the 100th like?
We're not.
Hey, we should invite Kazehaya too.
Yup.
Stop being so tense.
I want to talk to Ryu!
Is this Kazehaya-kun?
What are you doing?
I think it'll be even more fun if you came.
I never knew you were having so much fun.
H-He hasn't changed a bit.
So this is The People's Kazehaya.
I wish I could see him.
Who's she?
Coming in.
That was a total open pervert comment.
I wasn't making fun of your
Were we too loud? Did we get reported?
It might help if you bathe in salt water before you go to bed.
It makes you feel warm and helps you sleep better.
I hope I'm helping.
Type?
You said Kurumi's not your type, remember?
I'm glad I'm in this school.
With everyone else.
My life wouldn't have been the same without you.
I can't believe how time flies. Just like that.
I'm fine.
I do!
He's really great!
Why are we still building this stupid float?
Oh, Chizu!
Oh, sorry! I was checking if you still had your feet!
A drama of love and hate between a woman who didn't trust a man and that man who became enraged over it.
That's what the story is about?
Thank god we've finished the float and costumes in time.
Chizuru, are you supposed to be some kind of black belt?
Yano.
Got it.
Oh, I should be thanking you...
Huh?
I need to tell you something again.
Can I say something first?
Do it! Now!
Please accept our regrets.
But we're first among the second years.
Our costume parade would've won them over, if not for the bribe.
It's the same, isn't it?
Flushed faces, a gentle sea breeze.
It's the same, isn't it?
Black magic?
It looks real!
But since when did Sadako have style?
Me too!
simultaneousGive me a boyfriend, amen!
Now things have gotten weird.
Dammit! My gourmet sushi!
Strawberry Time! He's now Quick-To-Confess-kun!
What's with them?
Quiet, you're being too loud!
Pin!
You dumbass! You think she's able to pick up on these things?
Kuronuma.
Who do you think made this happen?
Let me think about it for a minute!
No, I won't be out too late. Uh-huh.
I guess I'm just becoming greedy.
I really need to say this, Kuronuma. Or else we can't go forward.
Geez! It all worked out! Isn't that nice?
What about Sadako? Still in Strawberry Time?
Wow!
Don't push, line up!
My girlfriend.
Yeah, they were like that at the after-party, especially Kazehaya.
It's my privilege.
No, I'm going to carry the other bag.
I didn't want to hide it. I wanted to get it out there before some mixed-up rumors spread.
The fact that I love you.
What the hell's with these bubbles? Shoo! Shoo! Git!
I'm letting Miura off the hook and making you do all the cleaning!
Everything they feel was what I was feeling just a short time ago.
I'm going.
I'm saying this because I know how you feel!
But there's nothing you can do about it!
"Distinctions"? She really likes making those.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
What the? Acting high and mighty just because you're the girlfrifscx200-
I can't believe he belongs to someone else!
But you already know all of that, right?
Damn straight!
Well, I'm just glad you got your Mickey Mouse confession over and done with.
So, what, are you here to brag?
Ouch.
If Kazehaya were to fall for me, it would have happened already.
Sawako-chan was just too different from all the other girls.
I never knew there was that side to him.
Kazehaya is never going to fall in love with me.
It's one surprise after another.
What?
Come on!
These are the presents I wanted to give you but didn't... until now.
Is it wrong for me to want to hurry things along because I'm happy... too happy?
That I'm the only one who's happy.
Me too.
No, not at all.
It's so weird.
No way!
Why not? You two are so close.
That's just because we were in the same middle school.
Funny face?
What do you think?
This is the best time of my life.
I'm Tomo.
I'm sort of happy.
Why don't you start calling the girls by their first name?
Start with your close friends, maybe.
Yeah right...
Right, start with the girls.
like Yano-san and Yoshida-san do for me.
He didn't even let anyone volunteer.
I'll go.
You look pretty slow.
Practice for sports day, huh?
I thought so.
Over there.
It's Kazehaya-kun.
Pigtails.
Your face is so red.
How about ramen?
ask some other time.
Shopping too, then.
Can't do that.
I guess I'll have to buy my own ball.
Oh yeah, thanks for the CD.
Okay, I'll bring it next time.
I can't really smile.
Wait, wasn't she over there just now?
I'm going to get changed super fast as soon as I dry off.
No one's back yet.
but thank you for picking up my forms a while ago.
Waitdoll?
Like a doll...
Like one of those dolls that grow hair.
Do you think it was a compliment?
You think?
Not bad for Ryu, though.
Nice to meet you.
Kuronuma Sawako.
Why?
Oh yeah.
Seriously, you'd say that in front of your girlfriend?
Maybe I should learn from her.
I was happy but I haven't gotten carried away.
I'm waiting for them.
One shot!
Oh yeah?
That's good to hear, Sadako.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Looks like fun.
Frie
We're friends now, right?
Sawako-chan!
So then when the pass comes this way,
Oh, I see.
But seriously, I'd be so pissed if she became closer to her than to us.
Tension, you know, tension.
Here.
Hold on.
No, I'm sorry for everything.
Here you go.
I called her by name.
It went alright!
Want me to carry half?
Woohoo! Thanks dude!
I knew it.
You're so helpful, Chizu-chan.
Well, that was all fine and stuff, but...
Pain in the ass!
Wait,
Maybe no one should confess to him.
Oh my god, that's so stupid.
So anyway, she's not exactly a bad person.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
Kazehaya-kun?
Zawa?
Huh? I'm burning up.
Kazehaya, can I borrow Sawako-chan for a second?
What should I do?
Kazehaya is the one I like.
Next episode: Special?
We're going to a baseball game, but it's the Giants vs. Yokohama!
If I had a choice, I'd much rather see the Carpsthe hiroshima team play!
You'll be in the area!
Yeah.
I'm free until five, you know.
Also, I have something for you.
i1but she exceeded all expectations.
Hey, that's dangerous!
It's fun!
i1But we lived in the same house.
Just stay here with me.
Listen up!
This is amazing!
i1I'd love to...
i1You'll be even more lonely.
That's not what I mean! Just act like it.
I'll do what I can.
I... I didn't think you would!
and that's when I realized...
And it's so romantic to confess under the fireworks!
Have you rejected me because of Eba?
I've completely given up.
But, I'd like to still be friends.
She came to the countryside all alone,
I'd feel sorry for her...
Eh, you liked Nanami all along?
Just a little more!
That's so gross!
Nothing. They've always been like that.
Is this hotel really in reception range?!
That's my line!
Okay, then just in case, I'll distract the teacher!
You're gonna help me?
I don't care how mad she is,
She's just trying to catch your fancy.
That's why our relationship is kinda... strained.
But seeing that anyone would think
I wanted to see you.
I really liked it back then.
No, it really
Does it matter?
Just leave it at that.
All this time.
Hey, Satoshi, wait!
Why?
I'll show you a nice place.
But there are no flowers...
They're on the lake too, aren't they?
It's a promise.
that you said you want to go out with me,
that you said you'd come to Tokyo...
Yeah.
What about you?
Actually, I think I'll just cancel it.
She's late.
I can't believe she's running late.
I'm... just waiting for someone.
This was the first time Rin's invited me to something, so I was excited.
I'll have a strong word with Rin,
But...
I had the wrong opponent.
It must be tough.
If you were with me, you would spend all your time looking at my breasts.
You plan on giving the strap you bought with your ex-girlfriend to your girlfriend as if nothing happened, right?
Doing something silly like telling Asuka-san about that...
Play in the Okinawa sea gourmet tour!
From August 9 to August 12.
What's up?
Wait a minute... Idiot!
Hey, can I ask you something?
Dammit...Needs to be replaced by an ERSB approved form of "That bitch" She told Asuka after all.
You shouldn't be spacing out.
I see.
Sorry for dragging you along when we were supposed to head back right away.
No, nothing like that.
Mum and Dad will be delighted,
No.
Well, good luck with work.
Don't worry about me.
Well then, why don't we both head out to the countryside on the same day?
Carpet.
Be sure to help around your parents' house.
Though... You look like you'd just give them trouble.
No, it's my fault for calling you over so suddenly.
Well, I've got to go to work.
Is that inconvenient?
It's decided, then.
We came here to pick you up.
Long time no see.
No, I wasn't rejected!
Looks like all of Hiroshima class is back together.
Speaking of which, she got dizzy when she was here before, right?
Well, bye then.
Send everyone my regards.
I will, good night.
I mean... don't go back to Tokyo.
Eh?
Stay with me forever.
Ah.
Eh?
together with you, Haruto-kun.
She said she didn't need to be shown around.Get a tour of the school
Eh?
She just came here.I ran into her right now
Really, that's the only redeeming feature this place has.
Your little sister is cute, too.
I'm sorry.
Just because you have a girlfriend...
Like Kazama?
Moreover, let's light some fireworks, Haruto.
What's the matter?
Do you think Takashi-kun and the others will make it back from the beach?
Huh?
That's right, Yuzuki-chan was really looking forward to going with everyone, wasn't she?
If Akari were here, she'd get really mad at me...
Y-Yeah.
It's about time for the fireworks to start!
He said fireworks, Haruto-kun!
I wonder if we'll ever meet again?
I have a girlfriend who seems to genuinely love me...
But...
Haruto-kun!
I'll call you back later.
I understand. We'll talk later then.
Huh?
I know that!
Liar.
Why are you here?
Oh, Asuka, you didn't go back to Tokyo?
BackgroundYoohoo, let's all have a party together!
That was when I realised my true feelings.
Well... Nothing to worry about then, right?
I thought so too,
She really is the perfect girlfriend.
It's been a while since Yuzuki-chan last came here. Of course you'd go see the summer festival with her...
That was it...
Say something...
She told me you dealt with Asuka-chan in a horrible way.
or how much I'm detested, as long as I can be with the one I love.
You always seem to make everything so clear, Rin-chan.
But...
What a huge city.
Going to see Yuzuki-chan?
B-Before you do that, burglar-san!
H-Hello.
You're kidding!?
I would never have thought we'd be classmates.
My sentiments exactly.
Under normal circumstances, you'd use standard Japanese once you're in Tokyo.
You're quite the cool guy.
This kid makes some really tasty dishes.
The both of them.
But in the end you're still flouting the rules.
Don't say things like that.
Shut up!
Chef?
The food you cooked is going to get cold.turn bad.
but you'd be too frightened to even say a word upon reaching school.
I used to be like that, too.
So yer really making fun of me, ain't ya!
Kita High's uniform...
Eba.
With that frightening face of yours.
I want to confirm her feelings.
Nee-san...
Compared to Tokyo, it's much colder here.
Kirishima-kun?
What?!
A while ago...
I'll see you in school, Takashi.
Hey, Haruto-kun! You're staring way too long!
That's enough! You've had your share of amusement.
It's so far.
Yes sir.
Geez, what's she doing? That girl!
I specifically told her to wait at the convenience store!
Kanzaki!
...having a conversation like this.
There's somewhere I want to go.
Wow!
Your breasts are ample too.
It's fine, really.
I can do it by myself.
Don't worry.
Somehow, you ended up getting involved in her selfish whims.
I wonder if they have Fruit Milk?
Yeah, I like that too.
That's because...
What?
If Haruto-kun isn't around...
Are you listening?
I was in a daze.
Your face seems flushed.
I didn't think you'd come visit me, Kanzaki.
The doctor was just here.
yet you still include tomatoes in my bento.
I see.
I didn't mean it that way.
For always going out of your way for me.
Do you seriously think every guy in the world would be happy getting a kiss from you?
Idiot!
but she said she'd be fine since you'd be collecting her.
I understand.
I-I understand.
Anyway, you should have spoken to me, since I have tickets as well.
Oh, Nagoshi.
The guy's supposed to come early and wait for the girl, right?
What?
N-No way!
H-Hey! Nagoshi!
I saw you.
I beg you.
Hey, Mina.
Eh?
I'm fine. I'm not angry.
Fight!
My bad...
Hang out with me for a bit more.
What do you think, Kirishima?
Even so, I still think it's fine.
Isn't it better this way?
You can quickly find the next girl.
By the way, do you prefer big or small boobs?
As long as they've got some, it's fine.
Hey! What's wrong, Kazama?
No, it's nothing.
I thought you were unconscious?
My bad.
It's not a serious illness.
Or, you should do whatever you can to get her to change her mind.
Nice to meet you.
Oh... how are you doing?
Sorry for making you come all this way.
Totally fine!
This guy's ex is in KyouOu.
What's wrong?
No, it's nothing.
an1Actually, I also didn't stand a chance with my current girlfriend initially.
Where are you going at this hour!?
It's all right, Yuzuki-chan. I'll do it later.You can do it later? - Kinda gross though
Come on!Hurry and come
Well, I'm not used to cooking.
What is it?
Did Kanzaki think there was something between us? Us being Haruto and Yuzuki
She probably also thinks you two are going out.
Ah. Kirishima-kun?
Could you return this book I borrowed from her?
We're totally not like that.
Besides, you know how Eba is, right?
What kind of an expression did Kanzaki have?
You seem to be in high spirits.
Now isn't the time to say "Welcome back!"
They're fine, come on!
But I'll fall if I slow down!
I'll support you!
You don't need to keep pushing yourself like that.
That's not why I'm doing all that.
Why would you do that...
You can't tell?
Everyone is so small!Small as in little kids
Shut up.
That's enough already.
Next is...
I have no idea.
Where is it?
It's not written down anywhere.
If we met a kid we didn't know,
What's your name?
My dad said it would be fun, so I came here.
I'm scared.
Hyoutan pond.
I wanted to watch a little longer,
The portable shrineOmikoshi or tl note? is moving out. Let's go.
Yes!
Did you come here because something happened?
I'm serious, you know.
Come on, it's fine.
Well then, I'll eat here.
Hey, we're all going to McD's.McDonald's Want to join us?
It'll be real fun, together...
If you keep acting considerate towards me,
Yeah, he's such a playboy.
so he told me I shouldn't tell anyone.
You're lying.
But I want you to be with me.
And then, she really came.
Mishima...
But... when you start thinking like that...
I'm here to declare war.
Is that the truth?
Why are you doing this?
Hey, Kirishima!
I know.
I can't help that.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
If I didn't do anything, I'd have lost both.
It's not okay, but I was worried.
Is that why you brought a bat with you?
Hello!
There's way too much to eat by yourself, right?
If you want, you can try some as well, Eba...
I mean, I wouldn't lay a hand on the girl I really like.
Ah, Kirishima!
What?
I'm already full.
Surgery... save him?!
Yeah, but the chances of success are very low,
Even though we've been friends since we were children, he never listens to me.
I can't help who I love.
but I'd never be able to bear Kyousuke-kun's death.
Panties.
I'm kidding, kidding. Go on.
Yo!
Since I brought it here, why don't you get me something to celebrate leaving the hospital?
Huh? What's up?
That's why... I'll have the surgery.
You need to get a clue, farm boy!
Let's hurry! Kyousuke is getting tired of waiting.
Eating food from someone who'd grow up to become a three-star chef.
He made it seem delicious.
I've got something I want to give you, so can we meet now?
I'm hungry.
Hurry it up, won't you?
Nothing, I thought your simplicity was nice.
Of course. I'll look for a job.
Eh? Not really...
As I thought, you were curious.
I also have a girlfriend now.
Looks like she isn't here.
Asuka, if you're here...
D-Did you see?
You can't talk your way out of this!
Yes, yes. Huh? seriously?
Hold on a sec.
Yeah, but it's a group date.
There they are!
Haruto... kun?
I'm sorry, I'll also be going home now.
Don't 'eh' me, get out your phone.
Oh, right.
Here.
Haruto-san, you met my sister as well right?
Did I say something inappropriate?
Haruto-san, you're so nice.
It's all right. It's safer when we look like a couple.
But then again, anyone would be, if they found out their boyfriend bumped into their ex-girlfriend.
Really?
That's stupid.
Even I could make you happy.
Well, tomorrow is a holiday. Why don't we go somewhere then?
Even though I'm right beside her, she feels far away.
i1The day the stars came falling.
i1It was almost like...
i1Nothing more, nothing less
i1Taki.
an8i1We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet
an8And then Gran and the guy at the rice shop...
Morning.
Hurry up and get off.
How come?
Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
Only when all this is achieved
As the incumbent mayor,
So the kids of the mayor and his contractor are sticking together, too.
Mitsuha!
What? No way. Really?
But two pubs for some reason.
Evenin.
Threads don't talk.
She's just telling you to concentrate.
lie a thousand years of Itomori's history.
The shrine and all the old records went up in smoke.
The Great Fire of Mayugorou.
But even not knowin, tradition should still be handed down.
As if leavin the priesthood and this house weren't enough,
You'll have the Kadoiri and Sakagami districts all wrapped up.
I smell corruption.
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.
Cheer up, sis.
No! That's against the liquor laws.
I'm sick of this life!
It was your turn to cook, remember?
Hey, let's skip club and go to a movie.
Stud?
Where's your lunch?
What? I could live for a month on the price of these pancakes!
You're right.
Ms. Okudera. Thanks for
You're weak, but you're always so quick to snap.
I like this version of you better.
Lucky him, livin the Tokyo life.
Uh, sorry, I have to go to work.
'Cause you're spending all the dough!
You don't have a boyfriend!
Yeah, but I...
Guess I shouldn't.
an8i1Tiamat is moving from east to west, as if to follow the sun.
What's with the uniform?
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know what "musubi" means?
They come together to make a shape,
Thank you.
So what does this have to do with today's offerin?
In order to return to our world, you two must leave behind what's most important to you.
It's half-light already.
i1you're dreamin right now, aren't you?
A date!?
Yes. Wait, no. Uh, I mean...
i1That said, I'm sure you've never been on a date before.
You used to have a bit of a crush on me, right?
Oh, finally!
Your... your... your...
She said she just felt like it.
Wha
You've been acting pretty weird lately, man.
Are you kidding me?
One for me too, then.
Itomori?
Wasn't that where...
It came down right here.
And Sayaka.
There has to be some kind of mistake. I mean, she died three years ago!
What did I...
Lively up there.
i1Taki.
Taki...
Eat this while you're up there.
i1That's time.
then give me one last chance.
i1Live up to the name we gave you!
I'm gonna head out alone today.
It's tonight. There's still time.
Grandma...
You knew?
Cherish the experience.
were leading up to what will happen today.
Yeah, those speakers all over the place.
You're such a nice guy!
Deal with it.
W-We're gonna be criminals.
Why!?
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?
an8Sis!
What are you doing?
Could she have persuaded them?
What about the operation!?
What for?
Um, it's me!
Taki!
Mitsuha.
How is it?
Hey, Mitsuha?
i1Your name is Taki!
He said sorry for breaking your bike.
Then I reckon it's settled.
What was that?
Go on to your dad and bring him around!
All right.
What do you think you're doing?
i1the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart and collided with Jupiter.
i1should make us all feel lucky to be living in this age.
It was almost like a scene from a dream.
i1Maybe I'm searching for a person or a place.
Oh, you're job-hunting.
i1After such an insane coincidence, rumors about the event popped up everywhere.
Thanks for today. I can take it from here.
I want to look at a Shinto-style ceremony.
But you're eatin cake.
i1for someone!
What's your name?
i1The sensation that I've lost something
You can have 'em.
Morning, Sayachin, Tessie.?
Exorcise?
Quit with the supernatural crap.note that this ties in with the shit Tessie brings up later
You don't remember?
We're in the boonies, ain't we?
Yesterday you forgot where your desk and locker were.
Like a dream about someone else's life?
your previous life!
Oh! Tessie, were you the one who was scribblin in my notebook?
Evenin.
Nothin special.
I figure I'll keep on living a normal life, right here.
When you keep twinin like that,
If you chew on rice, spit it out, and let it ferment, it becomes alcohol.
Do the gods really appreciate sak made that way?
Must be nice bein a carefree little kid.
Truly an idiot.
Where...
What a weird dream.
I gotta pee.
Hey, let's skip club and go to a movie.
You ignored my text.
an8Boom!
Oh yeah? Sure. Taki, you coming?
A hundred years ago, maybe.
Taki!
When is this dream going to end?
an8What happened?
an8No...
This won't take long.
What the hell is this?
Wha What?
You walked home with her.
Sis?
This freaking guy!
Come on, this is basic stuff!
Stop wasting my money!
Guess I shouldn't.
We're going now! Get ready!
What's with the uniform?
Who's that?
What? He's famous!
Those are the god's art, and they represent the flow of time itself.
In order to return to our world, you two must leave behind what's most important to you.
Kuchikamisake...
Oh, yeah.
Think we'll be able to see the comet?
i1She'll be at the station at 10:30.
Let's call it a day.
Your hair!
i1Well, that was the plan.
i1never swapped again.
Wha
Well, don't worry. We'll help you look for her.
What? After all the trouble we went through?
I'm starting to think that I'm on the wrong track here.
Why, young man, that's Itomori, ain't it?
Ain't it, hun?
What are you...
Itomori?
No way!
Can't be, right? Taki must be misremembering.
How's Taki?
Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.
The way he was recently.
and I remember the scenery from that.
Was I just delusional?
Tsukasa went to take a bath.
Oh, yeah... I think so.
So the Mitsuha I know is from three years ago?
Oh...
I remember seein some queer dreams myself.
i1"Nobody'd believe hooey like that."
That's it?
or else...
You...
Don't be late.
What's wrong with your sister?
Is somethin up there?
Tessie, let me borrow this.
What's Taki doing here?
A date.
i1I know one thing for sure.
Taki.
Taki!
It's really you!
Yotsuha saw you.
Just once?
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk!
So we don't forget when we wake up...
I wanted to tell you.
I wanted her to live!
i1Your name is Taki!
I did!
That thing's comin down? For sure?
We can do it!
What was that?
An accident?
Who is it, then?
What's wrong?
Go on to your dad and bring him around!
What have you done, Natori?
Please don't panic,
an8i1and stay where you are until further notice.
an8i1It's hard to predict the trajectory...
i1Who? Who?
It broke!
To build a cityscape...
You guys aren't much different!
i1Maybe I'm searching for a person or a place.
i1and most of the locals had already been evacuated from the impact zone.
Thanks for today. I can take it from here.
They're all the same.
What's your name?
My name is...
Ah, well.
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for several days once it approaches the Earth.
Mitsuha's already stressed enough as it is. Right?
Huh? What are you guys talking about?
"Twilight" comes from Germanic roots meaning "half" and "light."
Instead of complaining, how about we stop by a cafe?
and this whole area burned down.
Poor Mayugoro.
What're you talkin' about?
All right...
Got it!
Is that Yotsuha?
She's all grown up.
There are liquor laws!
Ow!
See you.
Have a nice day.
What a strange dream.
This is too realistic.
Where'd you get it?
You ignored my text, too.
Thank you.
Taki, you all set?
Oh no, what should I do?
I'll handle this.
Your meal is on the house tonight.
I handled it according to restaurant policy, but...
That dick?
I like you better today.
Thanks, but I've gotta go to work.
Wait a second, was that you, Tsukasa?
Okudera coming through.
Hello.
an8I cannot believe this guy!
I shouldn't, for her sake.
Hop on, Grandma.
the god's power flows through all ties.
Kuchikamisake?
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?
A date?!
Well, that's what I had planned, but...
What am I...
Um, Ms. Okudera.
It's not like that.
Oh, well.
What's she talking about?
Well...
Maybe your call annoyed her.
Ditched her, maybe?
Why do guys always tie haircuts to breakups?
You can't go alone.
And you can't contact her?
A Takayama ramen.
Are you all right with that?
It's nearby, isn't it?
This is the place.
They're disappearing...
Just two or three weeks ago,
That means...
I...
I didn't know you smoked.
Tsukasa went to take a bath.
Oh, Ms. Okudera.
How pretty.
The cords represent the flow of time itself.
and this was mine.
You're both my treasures.
you'll be living with Grandma from now on.
Yotsuha!
For all you stargazers out there, Comet Tiamat has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.
I've forgotten whose life I was dreaming about.
Tonight, the comet will fall on Itomori.
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!
If we don't do something about tonight, we'll all die!
It's up to us to save everyone!
That could work!
What, embarrassed? Shy?
Got the snacks.
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning from the school.
You do the broadcast, Saya.
Why?
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?
You...
See you.
Is it my fault?
Is there something over there?
Taki!
You drank that?
Yotsuha saw you.
Just once?
Hey, Mitsuha?
Who...
Don't be scared, Saya!
There is danger of further explosions and forest fires.
Who the hell is it, then?
Let's go, Mitsuha!
Oh, no.
Look at that!
This is similar to when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up and collided with Jupiter in 1994,
an8To be able to witness such an extremely rare phenomenon...
Not sounding too promising.
It looks just like yours!
I have eight, myself.
Remember that time we went all the way to Itomori?
Lose the beard before the wedding.
Haven't I...
i1...like a scene from a dream.
i1Taki-kun.
Oh well.
an8i1including JAXA, are preparing to observe the celestial show of the century.
Study hard!
I reckon Mitsuha's just stressed. Right?
Straighten up!
When the world blurs and you might encounter something not quite human.
You been feeling alright?
The ritual is coming up, isn't it?
Aw, don't remind me!
Mitsuha just headed on home.
Hey, Tessie?
Nothing special.
emotions will start flowing between you and the thread.
She's just telling you to concentrate.
lie a thousand years of Itomori's history.
Hey.
It's the oldest sak in the world.
Hey, why not chew up a bunch of that sak and use the money to go to Tokyo?Hey, why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and use the money to go to Tokyo?
I'm heading out.
What a weird dream.
Yeah.
Geez.
Got anything?
What!?
Good woodwork up there.
I'm late for work!
Better hurry, then.
It woulda been bad if I'd eaten that, yeah?
What do you have to say?
That guy was totally full of it.
Okudera-san, your skirt!
You really saved me today.
This is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself.
Want to hit another caf?
Do you remember where to go?
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...
That's me they're talking about, right?
Wait Mitsuha?
i1But...i0
Musubi?
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."
i1She'll be at the station at 10:30.
i1That said, I'm sure you've never been on a date before.
Are you hungry? We could go get dinner.
Really?
No! There's seriously no one else.
I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine.
Okay, sounds good. See you later.
W-What? No!
Hey, she sounded kind of down.
i1The number you are trying to reach is not available, or has been turned
i1But...
i1For some reason, after that,
Yeah, Itomori!
Where that comet...
Surely you remember that disaster that took hundreds of lives three years ago!
i1Three years ago, in October, it made a close approach to Earth.
It was the day of the autumn festival.
Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.
It's okay.
That picture of Itomori you made...
i1sometimes unraveling, then connecting again.
There it is!
So the Mitsuha I know is from three years ago?
Yotsuha!
Scary.
an8i1Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee at around 7:40,
Your mother and I both went through the phase you're in.
Oh, this? It looked better before, huh?
What a cheap fee.
You do the broadcast.
Why!?
It's a meteor crater!
You're right, Tessie!
Don't be late.
What are you doing?
Could she have persuaded them?
What are you saying?
Tessie, let me borrow this.
i1I'll be back tonight.
i1he'd be a bit glad to see me?
i1If we see each other, we'll know at first sight.
What's your name?
Taki-kun?
I came to find you.
I drank your kuchikamisake.
Yotsuha saw you.
So we don't forget when we wake up...
Wherever you are in the world,
I swear I'll find you again.
Your name is Mitsuha.
That thing's coming down? For sure?
Saya-chin, please! Repeat it as many times as you can!
Oh, to heck with it!
Up there!
an8i1This is Itomori Town Hall.
an8i1Residents in the following areas,
What's wrong?
All right.
an8i1Again, residents of the following areas,
i1This wasn't expected to happen, was it?
i1Hey. Who are you?
It broke!
i1So we don't forget when we wake up...
i1Maybe I'm searching for a person or a place.
so I thought I'd like to see your face.
I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?
i1Searching...
Excuse me!
Hurry UP!
Just make it up with him.
Morning, Saya-chin, Tessie.
- You're heavy. - That's rude.
You were totally possessed!
Question! Not "kataware-doki"?
and "kawatare-doki".
Kataware-doki? I think that's a local dialect.
I know! That was...
Oh! Tessie, did you write that in my notebook?
This is a caf?
Well, she takes center stage.
Threads don't talk.
The shrine and old documents were destroyed
So the meaning of our festivals became unknown and only the form lived on.
Yes!
Where...
It was your turn to cook. Wake up on time.
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.
- You got lost? - Yeah.
Nice timberwork up there.
What age are you from again?
Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work!
Your shift is today?
- Go, then. - Oh, yeah.
What?
Good thing I noticed. What do you have to say?
Okudera-san...
Handled it according to the manual, but...
What now? Do you remember his face?
No.
This won't take long.
You're weak but quick-tempered.
Wha-? Wha-?
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.
Did you see the election posters?
Could this be that we're really...
switching places?
You sure do like your boobs.
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?
They converge and take shape.
That's also Musubi.
is an important custom that connects the god and people.
It means the underworld.
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.
The comet?
What did Mitsuha do this time?
Yes.
Taki-kun, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.
You used to have a bit of a crush on me, right?
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me at home and at work.
You're meeting an online friend.
One Takayama ramen.
- OK. 3 ramens. - OK.
We could be cutting it close. I'll check.
Hey. Is this really the place?
That can't be true!
Surely you remember that disaster that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!
- What? - Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.
But I'm sure he met someone and that someone changed him.
If not that, then... a ghost?
Before the comet struck... So the Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?
I loved my wife Futaba. Not Miyamizu Shrine.
Who am I? No, who are you?
Grandma, could you do me a favor?
Yotsuha!
Maybe those dreams that the Miyamizu people had
A comet will strike Itomori tonight and everyone will die.
Oh, that's it?
Uh... We have to save the town.
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!
It's all right.
It's a meteor crater! So one did strike this area a thousand years ago!
Shut your mouth.
If you're serious, then you're sick.
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo. What's wrong with you?
Tokyo?
Hey, Mitsuha!
What's wrong with you older sister?
is gone.
Who are you?
Mitsuha!
Taki-kun.
It's coming.
Let's write our names on each other. Here.
He said sorry for breaking your bike.
What? I really have to do it?
The broadcast isn't from here? Who is it, then?
Oh, Mitsuha-chan.
Theres no way its terrorist attack in a place like here What's Chubu Electric saying?
OK!
- Look at that! - Wow!
You were still in high school, so it was...
'Morning.
Whoa, that's a lot.
Huh? What do you mean, nuts?
We're leaving!
Get off, already.
Mitsuha's already stressed enough as it is. Right?
Looks like the mayor and his contractor's kids are pretty cozy, too.
Awkward...
It's all so fuzzy.
That's what's weird.
What?
Instead of complaining, how about we stop by a cafe?
The shrine and its documents were destroyed,
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and this house weren't enough,
How's the datin' scene?
They're lookers, all right. Just like their mother.
Isn't she embarrassed?
You could include photos and making-of videos.
I've had enough of this town!
What a silly girl...
Who's that?
You in, Taki?
Uh... maybe a decade ago?
dreams are great.
Oh no, what should I do?
We didn't order that.
See this? Does it look right? A toothpick's in it.
an8Well, like I was trying to tell the guy...
Thank you...
No, uh...
Okay. Take off your skirt.
Thank you for helping me today.
Wait a second, was that you, Tsukasa?
You walked home with her!
an8It's her!
an8She was so cool yesterday.
Well, you did kinda make a scene yesterday.
I did what?
In our dreams, that guy and I...
But where and when can people see it?
Comet Tiamat will be moving in the same direction the sun does, from east to west from our point of view.
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.
and represent the flow of time itself.
unravel now an' then, break, an' reconnect.
That's what tying is.
And tyin' the god to the people
Kuchikamisake?
Oh, it's already magic hour.
Oh,
Good to hear.
Huh?
Let's call it a day.
Sorry if I'm wrong.
No! There's no one.
That didn't even cross my mind.
Hey, she sounded kind of down.
Your... your...
You think it's about some guy after all?
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me with my dad and at work.
But you owe me a meal!
You're meeting an online friend, right?
She's not!
I don't need a babysitter!
What?
And you can't contact her?
'Cause I'm not one!
Oh, well.
Guess we'll help you search.
Oh, it moved!
This is a lost cause...
What?
We could be cutting it close.
Guess I'll check.
That's it!
What are you...
Taki must have confused this with somewhere else.
There's no way you could.
made a close pass by Earth three years ago in October.
That means...
I can't remember...
I've been saying a lot of strange things.
It's the sake we brought.
This was Yotsuha's,
Does that mean I was switching places with her before the comet, three years in the past?
Musubi.
Get out!
Why am I...
I'm Mitsuha!
No, but watching the way you've been behavin' lately stirred some old memories up.
I've forgotten whose life I was dreaming about.
Grandma, listen.
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!
We sort of have to save the town, or something.
Some pay this is.
The town's wireless system can easily be overridden using its squelch tone.
Oh, whatever.
How dare you spout such nonsense?
Madness must be a Miyamizu trait.
I'll have a car take you to the city hospital for an examination.
See you guys at the festival. Bye!
Let's meet up at the shrine.
Later.
Tell your friends.
And why'd you go to Tokyo yesterday?
How'd it go with your old man?
Dunno.
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
Listen.
It's coming.
Who...
Who did I come to see?
i1Taki.i0
Who did?
Don't be scared, Saya!
Oh, to hell with it!
Yeah, let's go!
Let's go, Mitsuha!
Go to the high school!
Are you sure?
an8Again, residents in the following areas, please evacuate to Itomori High School.
It's over.
splittin' apart!
an8To be able to witness such an extremely rare phenomenon...
doing here?
That suit could be the problem.
Excuse me!
Haven't I...
Im not creating a debt at a time like this!
Even if this turns into a lawsuit
To take control of the company, with my own strength
Hey, if you go any further
When I turned three
Good luck.
I cant do this alone.
Despite all that, why did this happen?
It is?
Could I give you a house as a present?
I catch them from the river.
Ouch!That hurts! Is she a lunatic?!
What should I do?
do people save others when they want something?
What is it Stop that
Asthma?
Happens when Im stressed.
I am obliged to fulfill that desire, even if it kills me.
Hey.
Even though you say that,
If it was truly love,
What am I hesitating about? After she had saved my life, too.
Oh yeah. If youre going to live here, we must do that.
Chief?
Is that so? I understand now.
Youre kidding!
Enough already.
Yeah, that cant be helped.
Next time, if you see my friends,
could you not act so surprised?
The people here are all lunatics!
You cant hide it, can you?
Whats with this thing?
Not yet.
You still dont have a name, do you?
Oh. Havent I introduced myself?
It was decided that one cant live here unless I give em a new name.
By the way, my name is Nino.
Year 2, Class 3
I understand.
Kay, its decided.
but at least make it so I can introduce myself as it.
Then itll be Toreta.
Here. Is this futon okay?
But a cloth is still just a cloth!
But hey, have you really forgotten?
You did mention yesterday that youd forget me in a day, but
Including the one you lent me, there should be two.
What is it like living under a bridge?
Greece.
Ive been deceived.
Completely deceived!
Your lovers happiness is your happiness.
I want to see it.
No.
its still under a bridge.
Is that fine, or isnt it?
My girlfriend, right?
Hey, are you going to eat?
Ive only just noticed that shes cute.
She lives under a bridge.
Venus!
We cant keep thinking that the solar system is the center of the universe, after all.
But theyre all so embarrassing.
No, I mean
Theres only one question here now.
Normally, at times like this, a girl would react
All right. Shall I get out?
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
Its from the cleanser thats usually used to clean school sinks.
Thats probably
And the day after that
So, eat up.
Rec!
Yeah, thats me.
How true.
She must be as kind as the Virgin Mary.
Fine.
Sorry.
Theres no need to apologize. mumbled
Me too!
Um Is this gun real?
However, this is the first affirmation Ive gotten for being with Nino-san. alt: positive
Recruit, Im at the church most of the time.
i1and the warmth of all the people.
i1to discover the limits of my knowledge.
No!
I never should have let myself become so pessimistic.
I'll do whatever it takes to let Nino stay here!
I'm sure you've already looked over the materials in front of you.
You're looking good today, Sister. What's with the grisly getup?
It must be to distract those company men.
Actually, three seconds is plenty.
Thanks, Director!
If you'll excuse us
Rec. Hey, Rec!
Huh? Rec, you bastard!
I heard you've been scrambling around, trying to save this place.
It's not much, but I've got something for you.
But you know, I don't think this is even Rec.
It's not gonna be cheap. But we are a top-tier company, after all.
i1Takai, what
i1One more time!
Good to see you again.
Guys! Me! I'm home!
I don't care about the others. But Nino, you've got the wrong guy!
Welcome back, Rec!
What is it?
Don't try to come off like you're thinking of everyone.
Nino!
The president of the construction company.
He's always ready to try something new.
Mr. President...
i1No, Sister's not to blame.
Ugh! And where's the Chief when we need him?!
What's gonna happen to us?
Rec, are you really okay?
Yes, of course! I'm overflowing with energy!
Who the hell did you just call?!
i1Lightning crashing in the distance.
i1A lightning rod on a plain.
i1Be as loud as you can.
or bell peppers, or your dad!
Wha Says who?
So come on! Wish upon your star!
Don't be stupid! You can't just
You're not scared, are you?
You look great!
Not a chance! I've
This is just like a rollercoaster!
Plus, if it's for Nino
Please let us stay here forever!
The Arakawa Development Project has been... shut down?
Mee-tings-for-ev-er!
How could my plan fail?
So what happened?
i1What kind of power did you leverage?
i1Could this be another of Ko's traps?
Hey.
You won't get to see these very often, you know.
Actually, you're exactly like he was when I first met him.
i1I have no name to give her.
Hey, can you hear me?
When he's all stuffed and satisfied,
He became a star to try and make all our wishes come true.
My mask!
Here.
Stop! Ah, I have to do something
Goodbye.
Can I really keep them?
i1until you can no longer stand.
i1you can succeed where I failed.
Here? No... right here?
i1I'm just gonna come out and say it.
Ah, how do I? I need to find Rec!
i1I'm going to stand by Nino forever!
No matter what
Besides, all I brought is materials for beginners.
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?!
i1All kinds of people live here.
i1With that in mind,
i1Nino sometimes pays me a visit while she's sleeping.
It's a knight's duty to protect his princess from the darkness!
Nino! Don't get it cut, okay? Seriously!
Jeez... why does a costumed freak need a haircut, anyway?
I said no!
On you, a topknot would look simply atro
i1At least he's not too forceful or anything.
Were you really that nervous, Sir Rec?
Well?
We get it, but it's a bit dated.
What's the big deal about Sister being here?
So then, Sister... what kind of cut would you
i1Billy and Jacqueline, I think.
"I love you." Say, " I love you."
Spitting back other peoples' words That part of my life is over.
But... But I... I just have to hear you say it!
Please, tell me, "I love you, Jacqueline!"
i1Jeez! I know this is none of my business... But that's really harsh!
The 10,000 drones back at your hive
I'll take you to the fair tomorrow.
We'll consider it a field trip.
Okay, okay! Then let's have a fair down here. How's that sound?
i1I love you. I love you.
Well then, I'll just have to do it myself.
Of course not. Father was never the kind of person to take someone out to have fun.
Even if I've never been to one,
Hey, Rec!
Present for ya.
And this is...
Huh? They even have a mascot?
That's the proper response to seeing a man in a furry suit!
Cool!
We had a little issue with our budget, ya know?
i1A 3D theater, huh? We should be safe in here.
I'm not sure about the content, but it definitely feels real.
How about you work on creating a "dream" land first?!
Make sure the belt and handcuffs are securely fastened.
Now, you might feel a little prick.
i1This is the Iron Maiden Coaster.
That was...
What's up, Rec?
I don't know how I forgot. It was such a rare event.
I rode the carousel, and I sat on a bench with him and drank some juice, and...
will be forever burnt into our memories!
i1Perhaps
What kind of dream were you having exactly, Nino?
That dream really wiped me out, though.
i1I'm sure she's been through a lot, living under a bridge like this for so long.
That's not true at all! This is just how I look when I reflect on my mistakes!
No! What am I-?! It's not like that!
H-Hey, Nino... I have a suggestion.
If you really don't mind, I can move in right now.
Hey, you might want to take this with you.
Oh yeah, thank you for your kind consideration.
i1She traded with me.
i1Then again, she turned me down when I tried to give her a house to live in when we first met.
N-No, they're-
Good... good...
Magical Spirit Spell: "Made it look like my shell came off."
Nino gets up so early, she's probably already asleep.
Nino...
What idiot let Sister get in the batter's box?
Outlander!
The Amazon, our Mother Jungle, lies before you!
P-ko! Do you even have a license for that thing?!
Everyone, on your marks!
Yeah!
Are you sure, Billy? I don't want to be a burden to you...
Victory only has meaning if you acknowledge and overcome all possible disadvantages.
Did he already finish?!
Hmm...
Just like every year.
Nobody can pass me now!
i1I'm starting to fade...
What's with that stupid face?
i1I forgot to consider how I might deal with a broken right leg!
an8Come on!
Ah, that was amazing, Whitey!
Even I!
And look at your knees shake.
Rec.
Here, have some fresh fish.
i1Let's say both of my legs had been disabled. Then how would I?
W...
Rec! The new title sounds like it has two fishes in it!
i1My heart beats faster with every step I take.
i1Turn left? Or right?
i1My name is Ichinomiya Ko.
Huh? Treasure?
But I can't display it for too long.
After all, leaving the treasure chest open for too long wastes energy!
Why are you worshiping something that comes from Saitama?!
You'll regret lying to me!
If you could show us a picture ID or a phone bill in your name next time, that'd be great.
You honestly believe you look like an actual high schooler?
Watch and learn!
Amazon, no!
i1Am I really going to die right here in Amazon, Saitama?
DON'T TELL ME THAT WAS A FREAKING UMAIBOOOO!!!
All right, let's get back to the game, shall we?
And guess what guess what! He was like, toootally cute!
He's so pale...
What?!
So that's what happened?
I miscalculated my ability to climb down, but I went up there by my own will.
Of course, if it weren't for my special suit, the sun would have burnt me to a crisp.
It seems I'm right.
Is that Planet Bard's global anthem?
an8This is the Village Chief.
i1It's an eye for an eye!
That's news to me!
Don't play dumb!
Venus Jump!
If she really wanted to, she could destroy the world in three days!
Even if it costs me my life, I will defeat the Queen of Venus!
i1This is bad.
N-Nino?
Nice "I just got shot with a peashooter" face!
Awesome, Big Bro!
Well said, verily!
i1I'm waiting for you...
i1All that keeps us apart is a solitary door.
I can't listen!
i1But... I'm not just "someone." I'm her boyfriend, right?
i1I visited the AITA in Shinjuku for the first time the other day. However...
Don't go up there!
Sister...
Still, now she might co
i1Fine, then.
Nino...
This is just a comic! How is this supposed to help?
But why would you hide things from me like that?
i1The moment he said that, the box I held in my arms began to feel much heavier.
Well? Aren't you going to listen to it?
i1I thought that smile might fall apart in my hands.
Rec! Did you really think it over?
Nino doesn't even wanna look at you!
Just until the water on my head-plate dries, please...
Silly man...
You can't buy your way into a girl's heart!
I knew you had it in you, but you finally let it out.
Sounds like you thought about it as hard as you possibly could.
i1Every Field Day, they picked me to be part of the relay race.
i1In order to have as perfect a run as possible, I found a way to keep from dropping the baton.
Get lost!
My stage assistant.
i1In the remote French countryside, this is the tale of love for a girl named Piceaux.
Don't worry, this won't last. He just can't help his kindness.
But Rec, I'm really impressed that you have everything you need to make a real movie.
Because I saw for myself how romantic you and Nino got...
Hey, come on. Why would I do that?
Wait, we're already filming?
Don't get me wrong. I wasn't fighting for you.
None of them read the script at all!
i1They all wore the look of a serious leading man.
Yes, Director!
A white glove? What is the meaning of this, Miss Ninophie?!
i1All right. Just hold that pose and say your line-"Every beautiful rose has its thorns."
Every potato sprout has its poison.
No.
I can't do it! Besides, Maire could never love someone like me!
We're not even in post and it already looks like some CG-obsessed fantasy flick!
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Two of your "princes" have obvious samurai haircuts, you know.
Rusty... you understand, don't you?
Wait! My love transcends yours!
S-Stop, you two! Please, don't do this!
Not bad.
How can you still look forward to this after everything that happened?
i1Takai.
I'll...
Man, you people never think things through.
Sir, the entrance is that way.
See?! Sister's a man of the cloth, and even he agrees with me!
I'll curse you, meow!
I think I've just had my fill of this whole thing.
"Sound horror"!
i1I'm gonna scare those dumb pants right off of you, Rec!
i1Scare you so hard Nino will be totally disgusted with you!
Stop messing up my hair!
I, Takai, will now recreate Master Ko's perfect wink with my stomach!
i1The wind blows.
There's someone under my blanket...
If you can hack it here for a month, I'll give you a name.
I'm going to become king of the employed!
And why'd you make me all bloody?!
i1Actually... there's no way some unknown amateur could draw this well.
What else have you done?
i1Everyone down here has some kind of secret, but his involves his actual past creations.
i1So if that gets revealed, he won't be able to stay down here anymore.
Don't have one.
I wonder if he decided to run off because he was sick of drawing comics.
And... what's Nino doing here?
It looks like Earth blew up in that issue.
Almost.
if the reader is standing right in front of me, I want to draw something they'll like.
I called the editing department, as any good upstanding citizen would.
This place isn't your home.
Impossible! It deflected all of our attacks!
i1Without being hired by a single company?
And that's the heart of man! The strength of my conviction!
I get that you need to make up excuses to talk to Nino.
But speaking of anniversaries...
Is it the day they first met? Or their first kiss?!
I'm sure he's got something totally awesome planned.
Well, I guess we'd better go keep an eye on P-ko so she doesn't get in their way!
Oh, there's Jacqueline...
I'm no so pitiful that I'd fly back to my old flame just because my nest is a little lonely!
He promised he'd come. Billy will be here soon.
There you are, Jacqueline.
i1It seems Sister was just describing him literally.
He said it had to be today!
What do you see in that queen bitch of a bee?!
I just want to stay on as your little bro!
I'm sure you're pretty weirded out right now, but you know someone exactly like him, right?
Big Bro isn't some caged pet cockatoo!
Don't worry. This won't hurt a bit.
Big Bro!
I never said anything like that!
No, that's not it.
Isn't it like this, Nino?
No, like this.
You're taking longer with this task than I expected.
I'm doing everything I can.
i1There'll be real trouble if anyone else starts looking into her.
It really bugs me when flies like you go buzzing around her head.
Don't even think of landing on her, fly. Or else...
Hey, Nino!
the key to increasing revenue in our Hong Kong branch is...
i1Oh no... has Maria been having some kind of influence on her?
All right. Why don't we go right now?
I'll kill you.
Keep it together.
You remembered my name. I'm honored.
Did you think we'd drift apart from each other if I knew you'd lied about that?
i1when it shatters into pieces.
I'm going home.
i1The static sound of insanity.
Obviously I can't warp there directly thanks to the gravity well around planet Fundel,
i1Those crazy waves are pumping out at max volume.
i1What should I do? Nino's really upset about all this.
But I also want to stay with you and everyone else under the bridge.
i1So I have to give her a serious answer.
Hello there. You must be Rec.
i1Like this!
But you better use firm tofu, Rec. Understand?!
So you're really coming with me to Venus?!
I think it's about a size 7...
And I'll play my favorite song"Gimme Your Daughter"for your parents.
Well, as long as it makes Nino happy...
I'm done with the hardest part, thanks to you guys.
It's sneaking!
Jeez, everyone here is so...
i1I've never been too concerned with where I live.
i1An hour's worth of oxygen wasn't nearly enough.
Here comes a riddle!
What do the followers of a scandalized political leader...
have in common with Professor Pitt from the lab?
Here you go.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's the face of someone who literally hasn't eaten for a week!
I wish I was like you.
Next, let's measure your height, Miss Stella.
Simply amazing, Chief.
Ah, Shimazaki. Please be gentle.
i1Here's my chance... I have to say something!
I'm not sure if it's something I should say in public. I think you'll need a second screening.
I hope you did as suggested and avoided the allure of tobacco.
What's wrong with him?!
i1I haven't been having any debt-related asthma attacks lately.
i1I thought everyone in my family had that disease...
What the hell are you talking about? You've got rice plastered all over your face!
Check out this fever!
I guess this is... goodbye.
Why?
Oh, then let's do that test!
Not gonna happen.
It's a seven-day sleepover!
That's so scary!
What's wrong, Maria? You look kind of pale.
It's just one more day! Let's do this, then we can go to Venus together! Come on!
Maria?!
Normally I'd use Rec, but I can't go outside right now. In which case...
Is that...
i1I hate to admit it, but it's probably best if I let the Chief take the lead here.
I'm totally not, man!
We're outta here.
Never mind Venus. I want to go see my woman right now, Chief.
i1One way to get through this might be to dive into my own world like them...
i1If they had so much fun with these, I can just use the same topics as them!
All right! Then I'll just pick one at random. Don't blame me for whatever happens next!
I dreamed about that adorable Justin Beaver again last night...
Because of that, small, timid people are troubled.
Everyone searches desperately
On cold nights, she often seeks refuge in my room.
Youre even being a Sister when youre obviously a Brother.
You havent?
Speaking of which, you said she often spends the night, didnt you?
How many times has she stayed over so far?
Id etch it on my calender, notebook, and even in my heart,
And every year
She was just sleeping, thats all.
Im more worried about the depth of your delusions.
but hes frantic in his own way.
Die, you bast
No way!
I still stand a chance then, right?
To ask Nino for a date.
And the 3,000 chocolates I receive
Recovery result: that chocolate has been returned to Ooba-san from Class 2.
What were those who didnt leave their names with the chocolates trying to do?
I studied the materials all night.
The white rose that blooms in my heart
Its not a plan that can be crushed with just this, though.
but nothing will change unless I rid her of her doubts.
and well have touching conversations about me to liven things up while we enjoy dinner.
Great. Its fun.
She understood!
Ill look forward to the sequel of that picture story.
But besides that, your decision to go home was made too quickly!
Now that I think of it, the magnetic gravitation corresponds with the gravity and integrates
with the collaborated powers
Weve been able to converse with each other recently
Its fine.
In exchange,
Ill do my best to bring you anywhere.
But the Village Chief is still the best.
Love in the world!
i1That beautiful shell buried in the sand.
i1But with everyone else walking forward, only looking straight ahead...
I have a question, Teacher.
I told you she was real! And there are those crazy Tengu, too!
What, are you happy to see me or something?
Huh? Um, well... I guess I am, in a certain way.
Oh...
i1It's me, Amazon! I'm like tooootally in love with you! Let's go out!
i1I sincerely respect that one guy out of five with the balls to not turn and look at you...
I mean, I already have a girlfriend.
Stop with that weird chanting!
That your cell... I mean your...
Yeah!
There's something not right about how Rec looks at that Amazon!
Or this.
Since you're her teacher, I thought you should know.
You have good manners.
I don't believe you. How could you hurt him?
So. What?
Now let's see just how deep your feelings run! I challenge you to a duel!
Man... what does Nino see in this idiot, anyway?
N-Nino...
My ex's name was Nino, and she was pretty popular herself.
I'll make this a good fight!
i1times the height of Nino's feelings...
Yeah. Don't you want Rec and Amazon to end up together?
He escaped from the hypnosis!
Amazon! I'm sorry! I know I said I'd be with you forever...
Nino! I'm so sorry! I did something really terrible!
No...
i1And further up the river...
Kappa Roshi!
And me!
He tried to infiltrate the church!
i1Is that Shimazaki and Whitey? What are they doing together?
If we jump from here...
i1Wh-What's going on here?
Yes.
i1I've never seen Shimazaki this excited. Maybe this kind of hobby would be good for her.
If you'd done your strength training every day like I told you, this wouldn't be an issue.
I'm serious ab
I guarantee you'll be happy with our resultsone, two, three, four.
And why are you both treating me like just another face in the crowd?!
Do you know why I'm so hard on you?
Ah, isn't that five questions?
I hope we can always continue to walk alongside one another.
This isn't the kind of thing you can just sign away so easily!
Your daughter should be knee-deep in her rebellious phase, and this is how she sees you?!
i1was about to pass the five-minute mark on her flamingo pose.
Bonsoir? What's wrong, Last Samurai?
You'd better hurry and rescue that gelato. Come on.
This gaudy teacup, and tea overwhelmed by sugar...
With green tea and stuff? Sounds great! Really Japanese-ish.
Sir Rec, I know you said you have some experience in this arena,
Oh, well... just a bit.
Heh. Typical. Sure.
i1It's so beautiful! What's he doing?!
If you can't even understand the fundamental beauty of wabi, you don't deserve to stay!
I understand wabi-sabi just fine!
Me too!
i1I'll copy every single move, and when it's my turn, I'll impress the hell out of them!
Y-Yes! I-I understand!
Ah, yes, you... how could you wear a hat during a tea ceremony?
Now tell me, which of the rocks in this area is the most wabi?
No, this one that's like a chunk of concrete is so wabi-sabi it's rusted straight through!
Okay... how about this one!
I tried to pick some snacks that weren't too sweet this time, but...
What?
bord0blur0.5Just saying my sad goodbyes, oh no!
bord0blur0.5I'll just hold my breath,
bord0blur0.5Go and shine in the night sky, shine so bright we can see you from the riverbank.
But we should come up with a few different plans to make sure at least one of them works.
Anyone have any ideas?
That sounds like just the thing for us girls!
All right! Then the girls are going with that!
i1That's right. Whitey decided to stay behind.
I'll try to help out however I can. Let me know if you need anything.
I'm an aesthetician!
If you're ready to make the goddess of beauty Aphrodite green with envy,
Did you know? When your body shakes, your muscles are constricting and burning calories.
Add aerobic exercises like sprinting into the mix and it's even more effective.
P-ko... maybe you should try eating some other stuff...
It's a warrior's body. Not a single gram of extra fat.
We've spent the past week lightening and toning...
Oh, jeez. Why am I crying?
Well, you know...
i1He was very direct about it.
Well... hmm...
Now, time for me to resume my training.
Are you sure you're the boss right now?
I truly fear one of them may lose their life today.
that I honed for the man I love!
i1Your deltoids, teres major, and your abs! They're all your precious friends!
Try to stop the commander, my cardiac muscle!
Tetsuro... you alone just may be able to...
Rejoice, my muscles!
Poor things.
The power of the Holy Muscle Revolution.
Fill your fingers full of love...
Next time, on 11 BRIDGE x2!
i1I'm at a disadvantage since I'm more of the cute type.
Which one should I go for?
i1Boy, now don't you look cute? But Teacher likes strong women.
So that's the Bon dance, huh? It looks hard.
That's not it.
Teacher...
If he'd seen it, he'd have been impressed.
i1The festival has come to an end...
i1It's all water under the bridge now.
Rec, I have some salt-roasted fish for lunch today.
Um, Nino? Could I get something that's not raw once in a while?
Nino, would you like to go somewhere el
You need to learn when to shut up!
Why would you make a Hoshi-shaped lunch for me
He's really dependable, and kind, and wonderful.
What's wrong, Amazon? If you're in love with me, I get that, but
You've got it all wrong! I couldn't care less about that dumb pickled radish!
If you like Hoshi, just tell him, like you did with Rec.
i1This shouldn't be about me losing to Hoshi or anything like that...
You're totally unbelievable!
Was that supposed to be a wink and a kiss?!
Wait, she just went up upstream again.
You're an idiot.
Looks like the girls aren't here yet. All right!
Eek! It's so cold!
Teehee! It's like a secret kiss!
Reccie! Did you do that to get Sister's attention?
What? A hole?!
i1No, Amazon-sized!
So that's why Nino was acting so out-of-character.
Rec is leaving for Venus soon, you know.
But there's something I have to protect. And I can't follow him to Venus, either...
Wear it every day, 'kay?
i1I hope Amazon is doing all right...
You need gravity!
You'll use the gravity makeup to suck in that celestial body!
This is... the galaxy makeup!
Yeah!
Count me out.
Even if you're just a pathetic worm, not having you around will make my chances even better!
If I knew you had a background in martial arts, I would have actually seeded you.
So there's a preliminary round?
i1They all look like they're having fun with it.
P-ko?
i1Since red and green go together.
Really?
How embarrassing!
So they're allowed?!
Okay!
That's my line. Because my ambition is...
Actually, I've been thinking about entrusting the future to the next generation.
That's unbecoming as a lady!
Stella is eliminated!
I shall take this opportunity to do a little spirit hunting.
I told you, magic!
Did my raven locks, too beautiful for their own good, cloud your vision?
I can't see. I better pull this back.
You know what I'm thinking. But I don't care.
You got it all wrong! Dodge, P-ko! The Chief is looking at you like your name is Joe!
i1Right here in public?! I'm not ready for this!
i1The final battle in the Arakawa King Game has begun!
i1Who will grasp their ambition and hold the championship belt up high?
i1Sister or Maria?
This is amazing! I had not anticipated this!
Take a look at this free-flowing line!
Ohh, did you see it? Did you see that curve?!
She'll create a caste system and put us on the bottom rung!
How could he point a gun at the woman he loves?!
Just seeing her stance gives me a chill right on the top of my head!
If I knew his heart was made of glass,
If he's seen the attack before, he should be able to avoid it now.
No.
Then she dug up a traumatic memory, continuing to chip away at his will to fight.
Is he okay?
I am a servant of God. His voice is absolute.
"Throw down your gun."
It's a handicap.
No, they're fighting.
Both of you!
This competition of pure strength is too beautiful!
Huh? Maria? What happened to the light-speed battle?
I was just kindly putting Sister in his place.
i1The final round of the Arakawa King Game ended with everyone's greatest fear victorious-
What are you doing, Rec?
To all residents of Arakawa!
Making clothes sounds like fun! You'll really let us help?
Of course. That's my order to you.
A golden tummy warmer!
Please reconsider, Nino!
We never thought of her as some evil mastermind.
I need you to go over there...
B-But if I do that, I won't be able to move very fast, and...
Use your glare! Make it look like you want to eat them alive!
Can you gather by the riverbank? It's time for the closing ceremony!
All right!
That's a nice quote.
That's not even it!
Rec?
I know how fast the current is over here.
Rec...
i1The secrets hidden in the lion's cage.
Tohku tohku no BPM wa touni johku no iki wo koete The talk-talk BPM has passed the point of joking.
Kyaputen kuiin ni SOS misairu keigeki junbi yoshi Sending out an SOS to Captain Queen, getting ready to shoot down the missiles.
Jeez... day after day, you sleepwalk and sneak your way into my apartment.
How am I supposed to get any sleep?
Dream? Oh, well you did yell out "wait!"
Oh yeah?
That's not true at all! This is just how I look when I reflect on my mistakes!
No problem.
Now we can become even closer...
Love you!
What about you?!
But I'm the same way, I guess.
Hey, Nino! You home?
It's like that thing where cats get attached to the place and not the person.
Welcome to Saitama I've gone south of the equator!
You'll earn the blessings of all us maidens if you win!
Oh, Billy!
C'mon, Rec! Go, go!
Huh? Is Whitey really that fast?
- So this time, he- - Hey, look!
Someone's running the wrong way!
I told you, I can do anything!
Taking the lead is the dark horse, Recruit! AKA scrawny little pansy-ass!
Can't you tell? The winds have shifted...
Here they come!
I need to burn your image into my mind while I still can.
Oh, true.
But for now, I happen to be living under a bridge, going by the name "Recruit."
Chapter 116: "The Amazon Within Saitama Plus Tengu"
Yes, true. They are all tengu.
It's the legendary treasure that can grant anyone the power of a god...
King Garigari is the name of everyone's favorite iced treat, originally created in Saitama.
Saying that out loud is really depressing...
You live downstream?
If you could show us a picture ID or a phone bill in your name next time, that'd be great.
I was like, born and raised in Saitama. I'm totally friends with everyone in Saitama!
Then why did you all surround me all of a sudden?
Now, little girl... what are you gonna do ab-
It's okay. I can fix this.
Am I really going to die right here in Amazon, Saitama?
Don't worry. Given the choice, I'd say yes to an Amazon.
You don't get it!
Now there's no way he'll discover the real treasure!
He's so pale...
Some eccentric young children forced me to go up that railing, and...
Were those the same kids who pulled my pants off and hung them up on the railing?
I miscalculated my ability to climb down, but I went up there by my own will.
Flower? Hell no!
What?! So you've been here since ancient times?
It's an eye for an eye!
I'll ignore everyone else's troubling reactions for now.
Yes... I saw it happen late one night, just a few days ago.
Your true hell will begin the moment we pop!
Arise!
If you really want to help out Earth...
That was perfect!
Is there no choice but to run away?
Knowing such great evil exists, can I do nothing but leave it be?
Now, stand up.
At that moment, the frequencies of their insanity were in perfect harmony.
Stop it! Stop formulating a plan!
They might actually do something to Nino.
Maybe I should just give up and tell him the truth.
Shh.
- It's not over yet! - Leaving already?

Why is there a critically endangered ito on my couch?
I figured that out after we traded places.
Something under the couch...
There's still a tape inside.
It must be something really personal for Nino.
- What is this? - Brush your teeth.
I-! Th-This is-!
I just... I don't really know anything about you, so I...
N-Nino! Ni-
Rec, shouting won't do you any good.
You're right!
I can't expect you to forgive me for what I did.
Let's see...
I'm a walking, talking roach. Please smash me as hard as you can with a dirty sandal.
If this is really what Nino wants to hear from me, I don't think I could live with myself.
I shouldn't be asking other people to help me with this, anyway!
I have to speak for myself!
Chief, wait!
How do you like that?
I can't believe you!
I don't disagree with you.
Come on! We're gonna talk all night, just us girls!
P-ko!
You're like the Golden Corn Fairy...
How pathetic. He took off just because I told him to!
Something like that.
Hmm, that's true. Men have to be strong, right?
Um...
Nobody wants to hear these kinds of confessions!
It makes me uncomfortable just listening to it!
Please don't make that face!
What was it? You get an asthma attack any time you're indebted to someone?
It feels like my stomach and heart are being torn to pieces!
Then-
Don't mind me.
Next time, on 4 BRIDGE x2!
Don't give me that! You know I've always loved you!
Me, too!
This is the story of an evanescent flower that blooms and withers in the storm of love...
See her? No, I don't.
Hora sotto te wo totte Come on, stand and take my hand now.
Satou wo hitofuri anoko wa itadaki Add a dash of sugar right here to make sure you'll always be mine.
Yeah, well... there's nothing I don't have.
Why?
I'm glad you're up to the task.
Just read it right now. You'll be sucked in instantly!
Fine, but look how many characters are in here!
He's actually in love with Piceaux.
Billy the assassin. He was hired by a rival lover to kill Piceaux.
And you're obsessed with rain, too!
None of them read the script at all!
Fine, screw it...
Yes, Director!
So, what's Nino's role again?
No.
I know for a fact Maire loves you.
Okay, I need to just stop thinking about it.
Rusty... you understand, don't you?
M-Maire...
Then shall we settle this by force?
STOP!!!
Ahh, I'm so excited! I can't wait!
Ah, it's starting!
Stop! Don't fight over me!
I've got berries of steel!
Sister! What is it you think you saw?!
Really?
I didn't expect her to be afraid of ghosts.
Who would do something so clich?
Who's behind this one? Let's take a peek-
You know, in my industry, we never rely on petty tricks.
What kind of reaction is that, Rec?
That scream echoed all across the riverbank.
Whoa, he winked!
The bridge where we live is approximately twelve kilometers from the estuary.
Hey, Rec.
Oh, well
What are you talking about, Nino-san?
That is the most important relationship between a man and a woman!
For now, lets take at least two steps away.
And Nino-san, move a little to the right.
the distance of a first date!
I see.
Well then
Whats the next distance, Recruit?
N-Next?
Yes! Carrying the princess!
This is a princess carry!
I see.
Its dangerous.
All right.
Its probably the sunset.
Yes! Well do it!
Im going fishing after this,
Oh, how troubling.
Really?
A one-on-one battle
Yes!
Sister, you shouldnt teach a girl games like that.
Stellas special move.
Its the Suicidal.
Oh.
Was that what I did?
What are we going for, exactly?
A cake, eh?
Over there?
Whats wrong, Rec?
Wow.
Guess that kappa does give some good names sometimes.
Its fine. You dont have to speak.
Youre so cute that I cant help but tease you.
Sure, I have some.
Sorry.
Pervert.
Good-for-nothing.
Sorry.
You really have no reactions at all, Sister.
Youre such a bore.
Iron Mask, falling back!
The wind blows.
Iwayuru hitotsu no SWEET This must be that singular SWEET!
She usually kicks me out when she takes over my bed.
Welcome, my friend... welcome to the riverside, Maestro!
Don't have one.
Despite drawing solely by instinct, he still managed to write "To Rec" at the top.
His most notable work is called "Magical Twins Peanuts."
Sister, it's me.
So Ninohei said, "Ah, it seems Venus will be sunny with a chance of solar winds."
What kind of ending is that?!
Hey! I thought you came down here to get away from drawing comics.
But here I can draw whatever I-
if the reader is standing right in front of me, I want to draw something they'll like.
No! I'm not Potechi anymore!
I'm gonna hafta revoke your name. Sorry, you can't live here anymore.
Am I... going to die here?
But I'm kind of curious how Billy celebrates an anniversary.
She's fine.
I thought you were gonna celebrate with Billy today.
There you are, Jacqueline.
"Swift"? What do you mean by that?
Chapter 142: "A Love that Transcends Species"
The Kokucho Crew? Like that gang? Is the boss a bird, too?!
Jacqueline? What are you-?
Jacqueline.
It was for the best though, right? Billy returned, safe and sound.
Stop squalling like some little chick!
I never said anything like that!
I never said anything like that!
Comic creator and captain of the Earth Defense Force has arrived!
The most important part got taped over with some weird song.
I cannot apologize enough.
Still, I should hurry.
Wh-Who are you?
Don't even think of landing on her, fly. Or else...
I'll kill you.
Iwayuru hitotsu no SWEET This must be that singular SWEET!
With that in mind, I'd like to go over the company's current direction.
Consequently, sales in the Venusian demographic should increase, causing tables in Japan to rise...
So there must be some reason she's acting this way.
She put her school slipper on my head.
That's awful! No wonder it's so hard for her to come out and say it!
Could you come by my place later?
Of course, it's fine.
Death? Is he seriously trying to kill me?!
Maria came up with this trap to destroy a person's will to live.
You remembered my name. I'm honored.
My knight in shining powder!
This is just too scary!
It's like having to get a flu shot!
You're leaving?
What do you mean you're leaving?
Where could you possibly go?!
But I also want to stay with you and everyone else under the bridge.
Will you come to Venus with me? I can give you a wonderful life there!
Chapter 148: "A Wonderful Venusian Life"
You want me to come to Venus?
Yeah. I'm sure my parents will love you.
Look! He has a torso!
My, you have a lovely pair of eyes.
Are all Earthlings as perfect as you?
You snooze, you lose!
I heard everything!
Nino invited me! Just me!
Of course, Nino.
Ahh, Nino. Are you really that happy about this?
I'm done with the hardest part, thanks to you guys.
I seriously doubt my body's ability to adapt to the Venusian environment.

Hey, twins. What's the real answer?
Next time, on 7 BRIDGE x2!
Master Ko!
I had to take a physical at my company.
Maybe, but that's just for the people who eat the kappa.
- Bring it on! - You damn kappa!

Hm? What is it, P-ko?
Why can people always tell what I'm thinking?
Stella...
They started spinning!
Ah, Shimazaki. Please be gentle.
O-Of course...
Miss Shimazaki, tell me... What have I come down with?
Yeah, yeah.
Does it hurt?
Are you okay, Rec?
It's just 'cause of these tests.
I haven't been having any debt-related asthma attacks lately.
What's wrong, Hoshi?
What the hell are you talking about? You've got rice plastered all over your face!
Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about.
I guess this is... goodbye.
Our unhealthiness is under control!
They weren't healthy at all.
- Is the ability to cooperate with others. I think, anyway.
This'll be easy. Let the girls team go first!
It's a seven-day sleepover!
Day 2
Yup!
But Stella, I'm surprised you've been able to still train while we've been in here.
I... I haven't made fun of anyone for six days. Six days!
But a dirty root like you probably loves being buried in crap!
Normally I'd use Rec, but I can't go outside right now. In which case...
Hey, P-ko! Can I ask you a tiny little favor?
- Hey dirt girl. Go rot and feed the worms! - Come on! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
Actually, P-ko... what's with your hair?
N-No, this is nothing like a bud. I just have to cut my hair every five days!
Even Maria is really depressed! I really don't think we can do this...
Okay, let's go.
Just listen to your voice! You're clearly Jacqueline!
He never works well in a group, I guess.
That one's reviewing Arakawa invasion scenarios.
Still, what are we supposed to talk about?
Wh-What was he wearing?
Awesome! Did his headache go away after that?!
Wow! Beaver can do anything!
Yes, let's!
Beaver! Beaver! Beaver! Beaver! Beaver!
This mental illness would soon come to be known as "Beaver Fever."

Oh...
That's why!
See? Right here!
A lace handkerchief?
Maybe she really is feminine, despite her looks.
Hypnosis complete!
I want to protect her...
Chapter 159: "Tidal Wave of Love"
There's something not right about how Rec looks at that Amazon!
Whenever he looks at me or anyone else down here, it's more like...
Plus, he's been spending way too much time with her lately!
Oh, really?
Oh, that girl! She gave me nothing but snacks made in Saitama!
Come on! I'm like, totally gonna eat it. Like, chill out!
I need something more concrete.
Chapter 160: "Expressions of Love"
Oh...
Yes...
I don't mind. Standing and accepting it is the least I can do!
I don't believe you. How could you hurt him?
So what?!
Now let's see just how deep your feelings run! I challenge you to a duel!
Well I love him thiiiiiis much!
Uh oh. You saw through our secret plan.
If Operation Help Amazon Land a Man is successful, that Nino girl will run to you!
She doesn't need my protection. She'll be fine.
Good luck, Teacher!
Chief... don't treat me like some practice dummy.
Wow, there's a hundred of you!

You never know what he could have been transporting.
Man... why do I have to be the one to track him down and give it to him?
Oh no! Are these... divorce papers?!
Is that Shimazaki and Whitey? What are they doing together?
Lower that stance!
Next, cross change. Cross change!
Chapter 165: "Master and Disciple"
And you, Shimazaki! What are you doing?!
I-I'm sorry. I considered reporting in to you regarding this...
W-Well, I just had this really big project at work I had to finish this week, and...
That's what I did.
You have the talent to lay down white lines all across the world!
First of all, you must get accustomed to the drier climate.
No... I can do this!
What am I to you, Coach?
Ah, isn't that five questions?
Well, let's start with the last question first.
All right, let's get this signed.
When I see you riding that line, I love you more than anything in the world.
Shimazaki, meanwhile-
You filthy gelato! You don't deserve any help from me!
I feel not even a single speck of wabi-sabi in this poor excuse for a tea ceremony. Unacceptable!
B-But-!
I'll take the seat of honor. Oh, that's the seat furthest in, in case you were wondering.
Hold it together! Get mad now and they win!
Such smooth movements...
Umm... man, what do you call that bamboo thing you froth the tea with?
Ah, you noticed? I'm surprised by your discriminating taste.
You just jammed a wad of hair into someone else's tea.
Still... I can't take my eyes off of him!
That's it!
That was the perfect wabi-length pause!
Well, really, I'm better with rock and roll than wabi-sabi.
B-Because! I'm me, a-and this is cool, and...
Don't you want to know more about the Chief?
This is the world of wabi-sabi that the Chief loves so much!

But if I did that-
N-No! It just looks that way 'cause you keep getting taller!
Oh. Next time, on 10 BRIDGE x2!

Hey! Are you sure that's really gonna work?
If you're ready to make the goddess of beauty Aphrodite green with envy,
You mean you can make my already perfectly-toned body even more beautiful?!
For example, even a single week of the "Boot Camp" program can totally change your body.
P-ko... maybe you should try eating some other stuff...
You don't get fat no matter how much you eat! You could never understand how I feel!
P-ko mistook him for a yokai with a "cute baggy look while wearing his kappa suit"dream.
Wait! If I shave off all my hair, I might be like a pound lighter...
They say a human soul weighs point-two grams, so if I just get rid of that-
Calm down! Especially you, P-ko!
Chapter 174: "Muscle"
Man, those muscles sure disappeared fast.
No, that's perfect. Just stay right where you are.
Not only did he survive Sister's training, but he's still working out even now that it's over.
Sister, get over here!
Wrong. I didn't do anything.
Not bad. But that's as far as you go!
Hold on!
As a bodybuilder, he's superior even to his brother. And he can harness the Holy Muscle!
Can't you give me more power, my biceps?!
They're something you love tenderly- Like a flower, like a lover!
I won't let anyone insult my friends. Not even you, Tetsuo!
My power is leaving me!
Listen, Tetsuo's muscles. I know it hurts. You've all worked so hard...
You've witnessed a power that only those who truly love muscles can access.
Takai recorded some weird song onto a tape for me and then ran off.

I've been a master dancer since I was a kid!
I'll make Teacher mine by showing him how I can dance!
Jeez! What's his problem?!
Winner
You can have Amazon's lunch box, filled with love-
No!
Why would you make a Hoshi-shaped lunch for me-?
Oh, this embroidery...
A-MA-ZOOON!!!
Why do you hate Hoshi so much?!
You're still hopelessly in love.
I couldn't have done it without you, Nino.
And who are you?
Where did you come from? I don't think you're supposed to surf in the river...
Looks like the girls aren't here yet. All right!
We gotta simulate how the girls are gonna act!
Take this! Splash attack!
- Teehee! It's like a secret kiss! - No fair, Reccie!
Then maybe...
Sister is everyone's-
I failed to consider you might do something like that, Sister...
Alas! I had better go rescue her!
You shouldn't be so roundabout with these things. Just come down to the riverbank.
Rec is leaving for Venus soon, you know.
You...
Here, I made you a charm to make sure you come back safe.
Thanks. It still kind of smells like lemonade, but thanks.

I don't mind. I seriously doubt I would lose to something like this thing over here.
If you're participating, come take a sheet of paper.
They almost look like joyful little kids.
The rules are simple. Whoever's left standing on the raft will proceed to the finalist match.
Anyone left by themselves will be at a huge disadvantage here...
We'll always wish for the same thing.

What do we do?! Whitey's gonna...

Why?

I remember those days on the battlefield, back in England.
Stella is eliminated!
I don't mind becoming Stella's mother.
Yeah, right! You're made of one percent faith and ninety-nine percent bad intentions!
Excellent. The two most likely winners are now locked in battle.
But I know for a fact I cut something! Why did I not hear his balloon pop?
Really? Maybe take another look.
I'm serious about this. You should be, too.
Am I ready to destroy the dreams of my love just so I can force him to love me back?

You got it all wrong! Dodge, P-ko! The Chief is looking at you like your name is Joe!

What? "You were wrong about so much"?
"Take up your knife."
No, they're fighting.
Is that even possible?
I can't see a thing.
Hurry up and announce my decree.
I sheared my sheep's wool on an especially hot day a while ago.
But then, don't you think your head will get cold?
That's how I see it, anyway.
Use your glare! Make it look like you want to eat them alive!
You're talking crazy!

"Maybe we'd go to the public baths wearing matching hanten coats!", or

I'm sorry for acting like such a perv...
We're lovers, after all, so there's nothing wrong with it!
Thanks. A lot.
I love your haircut so bad it makes me sick, but!
Really!
I don't care if you traded or whatever, but from now on this is your house.
Okay, Ric, I'm coming in!
What? added by hina
Wow, it's already late.
When I wake up in the morning, she's always on my sofa.
Lately, she's been cooking fish in my kitchen.
Don't cats grow attached to their home rather than the people there!?
I can't leave it like this...
Wait, huh?
What are you doing, Nino?
Wow, it's just like the Hale-Bopp comet.
Yeah, I had to buy so many packets of chips to trade in for it...
Maybe this is a little far?
At that time, I didn't even dream that our meeting would lead to such tragedy.
It's almost time to start!
Warming up, Whitey? Great idea!
Let's take it slow out there.
Am I already in last!?
What are you doing, Sister?
They're making such a racket.
Sure thing.
I just need to save my strength until he exhausts himself! you know, where's billy and the last samurai? that is an excellent question. i have no idea
What's with that funny face?
Why don't you wash up on a beach and die, you starfish demon!
All right.
And even though I'm wounded, two of my squadmates are already casualties...
Here come the leaders!
Oh, wow! One last spurt! i don't like her saying that. at all. too bad she says it in english...

By the way, where's Sister?

Youre the heavy something?!
It was merely my expression that remained unchanged.
Cmon, stop telling me your old stories!
Sorry, but can you go back first?
but even in recent comics, Ive never seen anyone fall for this.
It must have broken down or something!
What the heck?
Thats way too clich!
That voice
Oh, Nino-san, listen to this.
Its been so long!
So, Nino, whos this guy?
Diseased eggplant?
Wow, thats some compliment.
A slap?!
This garden is full of the favorites of all the residents under the bridge.
Thats amazing, Sister.
Cheers!
Its fine. It suits her perfectly, too.
How about Ryofu or Bachou? Ryofu Lubu and Bachou Ma Chao. Both are names of warriors loosely based on Romance of the three Kingdom
Well, its fine, isnt it?
Sister gave her the name, after all. Right?
Theres even a cucumber corner.
It must be delicious.
Oh, Rec.
Its to provide for all the residents under the bridge.
Your job?!
Oh my, you shouldnt bully Rec-kun like that, Sister.
Since I was born, Ive received the best education for being a leader.
and driven them all into the top ten.
Dont let it bother you.
Youre lucky that your girlfriends so kind.
Hey, yeah! Hoshi and Shiro-san are too, right?!
Whats with this picturesque scene?
Hoshis the musician.
This wont end if I refute that.
That guy there is the beautician.
Shi-Shiro-san.
Yeah.
A freeloader?
Father!
Youre pretty lively considering its so early, Hoshi.
Here.
Well, getting sick of men like you, who only have looks,
Here is a joke.
First, you gouge, and gouge,?
Thrust it deep inside!
Right? Or left?
This is exactly why I hate men!
What's with her? Are the people who live on the riverbank this weird everywhere? in any prefecture
I know this is the treasure you're searching for.
Huh? Treasure?
What's with that flashy treasure chest?
I don't even want to! I can just go buy it at a gas station!oh boy this will be fun
We can see through your lies effortlessly!
You don't happen to have a driver's licence or ID you could show us, do you?
Even my video rental card would've been more helpful in figuring out where I live!
Am I going to die in Saitama, in a city of the Amazons?
Dreaming!?
That's right, it wasn't a dream!
We've been putting too much responsibility on you.
All right, time to start the patrol!
And look at all the songbirds on the bridge.
Where am I?
The same kids who stole my pants and hung them up there!?
What could you possibly be talking about?
Yo.
You're!
I'm a star, no matter how you look at it!
Sure is.
I won't just stay quiet while the level of insanity here gets cranked even higher!
I'm the alien.
Oh well.
Right there!
If someone hears us, our plans will be ruined!
Like that!
A whole different level?
But don't worry.
Well, you don't need to blame yourself.
Who's alone?
We're here, captain!
Gu... guys?
Now... Stand...

Wait, you guys were just playing along!?
How about that!?
 Don't think this is over!
Here's some peas, Last Samurai.
Yeah. Deadly serious.
Even if I wanted to forget, I couldn't.
To me, "light" means to be run by electricity.
I see you wrapped in your red coat,
Waiting for your knock.
When you're ready, just look up at me.

but at night she just sleepwalked back, so everything just went back to normal.
Venus...
Why am I listening to that!?
And
I... I pushed it!
You won't meet Morita.
This isn't what it looks like!
Please, Nino, wait!
I just want to talk!
Just come down from there!
The voice of God isn't going to be what gets her attention.
Did she just use a bird to take them!?
Even if it seems like I'm running away, I know she'll come down once everyone's gone.
Nino.
If Nino actually wanted to hear that from me, I don't think I'd have any chance.
This is just a comic book! How's that supposed to help!?
Don't worry. it has some wonderful lines.
Put your heart into reading them, and...
Ric! Come on, think it over!
Leech, leech leech leech leech!
That sounds like such fun!
Wow, Nino, that looks great on you!
Anyway, sometimes they need to be a little forceful!
Who, me?
I don't think it'll make up for her prized tape...
Catch your breath and sit down, Ric.
What, are you just messing with us!?
They selfishly nicknamed me "Ko with the Leaden Touch", 'Ko who Doesn't Know Baton Touch" fuck that.
And then there's the first time I went to karaoke in high school...
Jeez, this isn't going to make her happy at all!
Wait, I just want to!
I had nothing to say to such an unexpected response.
I'm sorry.
What's that?
My assistant is in stage black, of course.
playing without waiting for winter
I take a deep breath so I won't have to stop
Thanks, I think I can really get inside your head with this.
I wanted to make something out of your relationship with Nino... 
I'm not even comfortable with the characters or the setting yet!
Episode 131 "Camera, Action"
The camera's set up and everything, so even though I really don't want to, I have to go through with it! 
Nino, did you forget your lines?
P-ko, what are you doing casting Sister as a girl anyway!?
What is this, a homage to Yakushimaru?
Should both of them be in topknots? 
In the final scene, Maes, consumed with sadness, follows her to the grave.
You can't even have her over my dead body!
I'm better-suited!
Yes... Beauty is a sin.
I love you,

You'll carry me?
That's terrible!
Okay, I'll just stay calm no matter what!
He's acting like an A-list actor! don't you mean b-list
If he's doing that, no one's having any fun, not even him!
Really? Then what kind of scream would you like?
Looking back at the end of my journey,
Swaying side to side like fish
Its unseen power caresses my cheeks,
That's right.
I wonder if you can handle it.
Of course, I drew some for you all too.
Just like I imagined you!
Why am I the only one that has to be a loser?
Do your best! I'm ready for it anytime!
What else have you
What a sad, sad life. i've been waiting to use sadlife, this "pitiful kind of human" is as close as i'll get
He had reflexively written "2 Ric" as well.
He must have gotten burnt out and run away from it all.
I think the shock of being found out has left him cooped up in the church.
He's got that creepy interest in Nino, I should probably tell Sister.
The mayor wants the next chapter as soon as he can get it.
He gave me a crash course.
So if you keep drawing here nothing's changed!
I always knew, both as an editor and a reader, that you wanted to be recognized as a master!
Let's go, Potato-chip.
Yeah!
I wrote a song for you to commemorate today.
but you need to cut out these pissant little anniversaries you make up.
No, not that...
Billy's a real man. I'm sure he's completely chill about it.
Wait!
I wasn't trying to be one of those terrible women who go back to their old flame when they feel lonely!
Jacqueline!
Are you okay!?
That's right, it's our anniversary. We had a date...
What, you know Billy!?
Cut the crap! I'm Billy's sidekick!
Kokucho means "National bird"! Of course their boss is Green Pheasant!
Not a bird could stand in his wake!
He was so cool...
Yeah! It was supposed to be a happy anniversary!
Bro!
Wait, you didn't have wings to begin with...
She came up with a reaction I never remember giving!
pre
It is I, Earth Defense Force Captain, Manga Mask!
Oh, oh, goodbye days
All the important parts are taped over with some weird song!
I told you to check out my son's lover.
The father's as foolish as the son.
The girl in that photo is under my protection.
What just happened?
So she's stepping on me!?
My parents got in touch with me...
Yes.
Of course! No problem!
Contacted by her parents...
Look out!
I'm going home.
I want to go home.
But I want to be with you, too. I want to be with everyone from the riverbank.
Will you come with me to Venus?
Of course! I'm sure my parents will just love you!
Like this!
It seems that the maiden veiled in white's dreams are about to come true.
This way I won't have to leave anyone!
and I'm afraid of unknown pathogens.
I even used scuba gear underwater!
I'm glad that that's Nino's secret.
oh god new ed time paging d4rk
Get it? Watson? Watt? Am I right?
Sorry, it just came to me all of a sudden.
Well start with me!
yours is
the best of all.
Shes so bored that shes fallen asleep, hasnt she?
The match is mine.
wouldnt it be better if I did that job instead?
Because, after I take your job from you,
Rec, thats
You couldnt know whats in demand under this bridge!
Your swimsuit
Could you be teaching them to swim, Nino-san?
Hey, Brothers
Even if you sink for a moment, keep your body relaxed.
If you really want to swim, first remove those masks!
You cant float because you wear those things and dont seem like people!
Besides, we knew from the very start that we could swim if we removed our masks!
we could fly in the sky and even cross over space-time.
Correct that and Ill kill you.
Yeah.
So, well need a tool.
A tool like that
A broth infused with live Kappa.
I think its the smell of polypropylene.
and take some nutritional supplements to ensure the balance.
Plus, Id never let my body chill.
Seriously, how about starting a school?
Well, I think thats a good idea.
With the way they are, itd be useless, no matter what I do for them.
Sister with common sense.
And with common sense
Village Chief!
With this method, Ill eliminate all the lack of common sense under this bridge.
What is it?
I wonder what
Magic levitation!
One more!
Rec, is this spot okay?
Oh sheesh, Nino-san, thats easy for me.
I guess thats fine too...
Nino-chan, do you know that?
I have to start with one. Then we can go to ten and a hundred.
Stella?
She has the big sister role, after all.
You have to be qu
Stop!
Im hear to work on my new song, Class Rumble.
So, if I have a concert at the same time as a class, which one would you visit?
You...
Thats all.
Yay!
Rec-san, youre an esper like us!
Rec-san.
Its our spare, but keep it on!
Itll be too late if the crazy men from the lab detect your esper brainwaves!
Oh yeah... What I enjoyed most about science as a kid
was when I created a rocket out of a plastic bottle.
Its a rocket!
I cant?!
I wonder what that is...
This is pretty good. Now if it should make it to Venus, it wont be seen as being rude.
Its none of your business where I start a school!
Fact is, my orphanage was the most wicked in Europe.
Lets do it!
Now that I think about it, maybe she came to school a little too late.
Youre great, Stella.
Wow!
Well, even teaching a little bit is good.
Oh yeah, I should check the rocket before firing it.
Anyway, when did you get here?
You damned warmonger of a priest!
Youre spelling your name without any mistakes.
Sister.
Ill get you out of it now.
Let go!
Do I look like a sacrifice?!
What kind of action manga did you get that from?!
Please?
When I get my license, I can drive far away to find seeds!
None!
A car, eh?
Image change?
Maybe I should do it again.
Wild?
Being a kappa is pretty cool, huh?
No! I love his insides, too!
because thats the way of living he treasures!
Short story.
You'll never accomplish anything with such a vague goal.
Rewrite it.
So...
Sort of.
You really think these clothes are enough to make me submit to you?
We can't wait any longer. Let's go take a look outside.
Now then...
Oh my, what an amazing ensemble!
Next! Next staff member!
Wow.
Oh, it's a lighter?
Ah, so that explains the costume
And this young lady here?
Nino... Niino... Miss Niino!
Miss Niino, do you feel you are equipped
Mr. Takai?
You really went all out, huh?
i1Cavity checks are apparently a daily Ichinomiya ritual.
i1I may have slightly overreacted earlier, but now it's obvious
If two people are really in love, they'd wanna kiss all day, every day, year 'round!
You're not in love!
Really? He always looks like this.
And then
i1And so, a new species of heart-broken sea creature has been born.
You think so?
I agree, sir.
His work hasn't suffered, but this is how he's been spending his free
See? Starfish!
If you must know, it's to thank him!
Here, Rec!
Ya goin' somewhere?
compared to how he was back in England.
There are lots of people here I haven't met yet.
Sister has a crush on Maria, from the farm nearby.
So Sister's really been talking about...
i1Unrequited love?
This shall be her downfall!
Downfall?!
No matter how much Sister might love Maria,
I don't like that word, "unrequited."
Heartbreak? Sure, that's a word I understand. My heart's definitely shattered.
But what's this crap about "unrequited"?!
Big Sis! Yes!
i1We just have to accept the fact that Stella has turned into a freak.
don't you think you should worry about yourself?
Ahh, and so then you came here to warn
Or maybe you just ran away?
What?! Hell no! You're in deep
Crapping yourself!
OH YEEAAAAAAHH!!!
She'd kill me a hundred times over.
I've developed a secret technique just for you.
Ave Death
Let's have a little chat first.
Lemme go!
Aww. Stella, that's a cute little move.
That'll be 790 yen, please.
It makes me glad to be alive.
i1Hey, it's not abandoned!
Hey! Hey, you!
Why'd I leave without my face on?
Wait, so if that guy I saw was really you,
I just assumed the whole "mask" thing was like your personal trademark.
What's with that look of disappointment?
i1But my producer was an absolute marketing genius.
i1I just sang whatever he told me to.
Moon? Don't be silly. The Moon's way up there.
Be that as it may, I'm still Moon!
i1She told me Venusians are masters at distinguishing celestial bodies.
Will you come on the show tomorrow?
Sure thing!
It's Nino's turn this time, but she was fast asleep when I went to get her.
i1Its shape may not be perfect.
i1It retains the contours of our hands and fingers.
i1Sunbathing in the summer breeze is incredibly pleasant.
Oh, is that all?
Fire alarm! Fire alarm!
Not to worry.
Oh man, I'm really hungry.
Your cookies are the best.
So are you some kind of mama bird or something?
You should stop trying so hard.
i1No, it might actually be because of his chanting.
It's more than just some favor.
C-Calm down! Just follow the "three don'ts"!
He can be trusted completely. He's worth taking care of.
Yes, that's correct. The large area right in the center of the Arakawa River.
They simply aren't things a man of your caliber has earned.
The Ichinomiya Group. I'm sure you've heard the name before, yes?
Remember that, and you'll want to be nice to everyone you meet.
There's a very real possibility we won't be able to stay down here once the construction starts!
I really don't wanna become some kind of overnight celebrity.
Stop stressing, Recruit.
That's not it at all!
When does construction begin?
Well... construction doesn't start for a while, but you should probably leave soon, anyway.
i1But what do you expect when you try to kick someone out of their home?
government swine.
Um... hi there. I'm Mr. Suzuki, from the Ministry of Land.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
i1He's like a different person.
Well, this little piggy had better get going. I'm really sorry!
What do we do, Chief? We might really have to leave!
No!
I wanna stay right here.
i1This is the last text I ever sent her.
But I'm pretty sure no one will let me eat theirs..."theirs" is bad, since it's not her stomach or liver at issue, but how to rewrite?
an8i1Ticket number 52, please come to counter C4.
I thought I'd lost that thing and ran around everywhere looking, only to find you holding it!
an8i1Ticket number 54, please come to counter A2.
You don't say.I see.this is outright rude. hopefully that's appropriate here.
Normally you'd act more surprised or say something poetic like "the fairest flowers soonest fade" to cheer me up.lit. cheer me up with a "bijin hakumei" - the beautiful die young. there's maybe an equivalent expression that goes "the fairest flowers soonest fade", but basically all the hits I get for it are as a tl for "bijin hakumei" so ???
Sorry, but don't drag me into your coincidences.
Okay, I get it.
I want you to keep my illness a secret.
You don't have any friends?
I'm good.
i1she volunteered for a vacant library assistant position, for whatever reason.
What else should I be doing, then?
I suppose I do.
Even though you never know if you'll drop dead tomorrow!trying hard to make this subject-agnostic, i.e. "one never knows whether one will drop dead tomorrow"
But that's apparently because there's been some nifty medical advancements in the last ten years or so.
It's amazing what humans can do.
is there no one in our class you're close to?
It's my hobby to imagine what someone thinks about me.
Then, how do you think I think of you?
Lady, my clothes are all stained thanks to you.
Are you saying you'll pay for her?
Bicycles aren't allowed on the shopping street, you know.
Apologize to her!
You fucking brat!
It's pretty clear who'd be found guilty in court!
Ouch, that gotta hurt.
We're going in here!
Hey.
Do you know why cherry blossoms bloom in spring?
Once the blossoms have fallen in April, it actually just takes three months for them to sprout buds again.
I just happened to run into her.
It's not like that. We just get along.we just get along, or anything that isn't "friends"
Morning!
I already listened to it, so I'll lend it to you.
an8Yo!
Takahiro-kun would be way better boyfriend material!
You know it!nice one!
But I'll pass.
For us to get along until I die.
but I don't want them talking to me or prying into my life.
Oops.
Paradise!
You're not even batting an eye at all the cuties here.
You know, I...
This is my best friend, Kyoko.
What?!
Are you...
My family overreacts to everything I say, and they're desperately trying to pretend everything's normal.
So...
is fun!
Now that I'm in high school,
What do you mean?
Instead of reading books all the time, spend more time with people!
But you seem so close recently.
Don't tell me you think I'm asking you because I like Yamauchi!
In order to keep my parents from worrying,
Why not?
At least my brain is, unlike you.
The only thing not working is my pancreas!
I heard a police officer mention on TV
I'll be sleeping over here.
Fine, I'll have a quick lie-down later.
It's sad playing cards with just the two of us.
why don't we play truth or dare?
You're not allowed to quit partway.
Why are you springing a question like that?
This is just among the people I can recall,
Yes, obviously!
This is pretty nerve-racking!
What's the hobby you've kept up the longest?
Well, I guess I've always liked movies.
What's the saddest thing you've experienced?
Seriously...
All right, if you say "truth," you have to tell me three things you find cute about me.
I can't stand!
Seven.
Come home safe and buy me a souvenir.
Looks like you actually had fun!
In junior high she spent the whole night crying after breaking up with her boyfriend.
Hey, are you listening?!can be made even angrier
You think you can do that?
Sorry.
MC: No thanks. That's the opposite way from my house.
A bit.
The Little Prince! Do you know about it?
Weren't you going to lend me a book?
Now, now, there's no need to hurry.
If you feel like it, huh...
Huh?
You live around here?
Why is she with someone as sullen and antisocial as you?
What the fuck do you know?!
Sakura!
Are you okay?
I hate you, Takahiro!
If I'd kept to myself, no one would have gotten hurt.
That's not true!
you accepted my request.
Will you stay with me?
I don't think there's much that I can do for you.
i1Something hiding in the shadows of her bright smile
i1was steadfastly eating away at her.
I almost regret worrying.
Did the people in class say anything?
Hit me. Ask me anything.
Paying attention to someone...
Just like we've both chosen to live out this moment here and now.
What's wrong?
You're embarrassing me.
Kyoko?
Not happening!
i1I ended up learning what may have been the reason for it.
Are you taking me somewhere quiet so you can pull a murder-suicide?
I'll be sure to let you know before I die.
That's why it had to be today.
Thank me.
So...
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Don't take your mother lightly.
Hey!
I'm meeting up with someone.
No, I'm good.
Let's go pick.
Nice catch!
i1Sorry!
i1It's not like you to say something so pleasant!
i1How mean!
an8i1This afternoon, on a street in Kitakura...
i1I had regained my composure enough to be able to accept reality.
Here, take this.
Um...
Thanks to you, she'll...
i1He's a really funny guy!
i1I felt really relieved.
i1Then Kyoko surprised me with a sudden appearance!
i1So happy that I could barely believe it.
i1I was so happy, so happy,
I've written messages to a bunch of people,
you figured yourself out on your own and found your own allure.
I was able to think of myself as the one and only "me" out there for the first time in my life.lit. "as the one and only 'me' out there"
But you cared for a uninteresting girl like me.
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
i1So I came up with this.
Oh, yes.
ill.
I mean you!
I could have been with Sakura...
if you're one day able to forgive me...
i1so I'd like to start off by complaining.
i1Someone able to acknowledge others, and to love others.
What're you saying?
Sakura's waiting for us.
skip as before
i1This is the last text I ever sent her.
i1I have no idea
Whatever you say.
Those are historical novels, and this shelf is for history books.
Oh yeah, you gotta hear what I saw on TV yesterday!or maybe something like "you gotta hear what I saw on TV yesterday"damn she's loud
You're the only one I can ask.
Huh?
Wait
an8i1I repeat.
You don't say.I see.this is outright rude. hopefully that's appropriate here.
Why were you at the hospital?
Yes.
I get where you're coming from...
Where is this coming from?
You can eat my pancreas if you want.
Everyone thinks of me as just a boring classmate,
You can't know that.
I think you do idiotic things every now and then, but I'm not trying to treat you like one.
Look at this mess.
This is your fault, not hers!
See ya, lady!
Hey, hold it!
You too! Wait up!
Ow!
Why... did you have to go and... do something like that?
Welcome back.
Sakura! What's your relationship with that guy?
Thanks, but I'm good.
Good morning.
Thank you!
Sure.
I'm telling you, it's not like that.
You told the people in class that we're not close, didn't you?
I don't see why you should be angry with me.
I just want to eat what I want to eat.
Kyoko!
What?!
Hot weather has its own charm.need to find a good stock translation for this sort of line, for both this and other projects
I should seize the chance to have one or two of those.
So in other words,
you still want to get a boyfriend?
If I said I wanted a boyfriend, would you do something about it?
Wait, hold on!
That's way off.
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
Good morning.
they'll usually tearfully agree,
That's awful. And sad.
It's my book, so I can do what I want with it.
All right, fine.
you have to experience the bed too!
You do that!
No peeking, got it?
Wait, is this...
You don't know it?
I'll ask you "truth or dare," so start off by replying "truth."
Who do you think the cutest girl in our class is?
By the way, if you choose dare,
Oh, you mean Hina!
That's the kind of girl you like?
This is just among the people I can recall,
Huh... You've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
I'm not sure what's obvious about it.
I thought you weren't interested in others?
Getting to knowmeeting you, maybe!
Which one do you want?
but this time I'll give you both my question and dare, so could you choose from them?
Next is the last round.
That's iffy!
Yeah.
That jacket suits you.
You know, Sakura is way more delicate than you think.
Someone has to stay by her side and watch over her.
I already took care of all the work.
Hey.
MC: No thanks. That's the opposite way from my house.
but there's one single book I've liked since I was a kid.
Come on!
See ya later!
I've been wondering for a while.
What are you even saying?
That's a relief.
But I'd call that a resounding success.
Wait, what's up?
Let me go, it hurts.
Are you playing along with my joke?
But you can let go now...
Sakura?
Do you think you're better than him or something?
Besides, we two...
That's not true.
That's just your interpretation.
so it might take a while.
Now I can't go to the festival this weekend...
They're saying that the reason for your absence is me stalking you.
If you talk to them, I'm sure they'll see that you're a fun person.
Are you still fantasizing about what everyone else thinks about you?
You have to start with an interest in others
If you're all alone, you can't tell that you exist.
Thank you.
Then what?
Kyoko!
I put some clothes here.
Say, Mom...
You won't need to do anything for a while, though.
I knew it had to be a little-known spot.
I know I don't seem like it, but I'm worried about you, okay?!
You want me to live?
Very much.
I told you before, remember?
Come on, you can be a bit more frank.
I made you worry for no good reason.
Heading somewhere?
What, seeing Sakura again?
See you.
Stop, stop it!
i1If I asked her,
i1The complete opposite of me.
i1A person like that.
i1How can I become like you?
Yeah, you're right.
i1I was coming up on the tenth morning after the day she died.
Here, take this.
I need to tell you something.
What?
She kept a booka sort of diaryafter she got sick. Im hoping youll let me read it.
Go ahead.
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
To the one person who knew about her disease.
Thank you.
i1April 22.
i1I'd like to get to know him better.
i1I'll write about the trip when I'm back.
Thank you.
i1Don't worry, I won't write your name.
But our relationship can't be described through simplecommon terms like love or friendship, right?
Remember when I asked you to play truth or dare with me at the hospital?
Why won't you ever speak my name?
you were afraid to make me your friend or girlfriend.
My allure can only be brought out when I'm with others.My potential can only be brought out when I'm with others.lit. "my appeal", "what makes me appealing", "my charm", but I feel like using that sounds awkward... but maybe "potential" strays too far away from the original line. or maybe it still gets the point across?
Your relationship with others is what forms you as a person.
I told you this before,
were always only yourself.
Without relying on interacting with others,
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
but won't you and Kyoko come here and have dinner with us one day?
You know, cherry blossoms and spring.
You didn't come to Sakura's funeral, did you?
You're right.
What's this?
This is her book.
I want you to read this.
I won't forgive you.
I want you to forgive me.
i1You know how I am,
You're disgusting.
I meant it in a wider sense.
Let's go to Sakura's place already.
As proof of the life she lived,
What are you doing?
Those are historical fiction, and this shelf is for history books.
A diary?
That's mine.
My pancreas has stopped working,
What?!
Normally, you'd act surprised,
Bye.
It'll be our little secret.
I'm good.
Yes.
What were you expecting?
What I did or didn't do today doesn't change its worth.
Don't tell me eating cow entrails is also part of your treatment program?
When someone asks me about my favorite food, I usually say, Offal.
What's that mean?
Are you still sulking?
an8Hey! Say something!
Cough up the dough already!
Couldn't you hear me?
Hey, hold it!
so we need to make sure we can talk as much as possible.PAR: so we have to make sure to keep close frequent contact.
Not really.
Right? I can totally hook you up with a better guy.
Great at sports, and has both looks and smarts.
Where to?
but he didn't really work out as a boyfriend.
an8Sorry. So how much do I owe you?
My family just overreacts to everything I say.
is fun!
So you really were slacking off.
Get there?
And an overnight one at that.
We ended up in the same room, but you don't mind, right?
They said it was their fault, so they gave us a way better room than what we paid for!literally: than what Iwe had bookedreserved.
You don't always get a nice room like this, so you have to try the bed, too!Experience or enjoy the bed
Playing cards with two people is depressing.
What's that? Sounds too philosophical for a game.Alt: 'What sort of name is that for a game? Sounds too philosophical.'
I'm just going off the people I remember, but...
You still want to do this?
Is that it?
My childhood, huh?
Basically, I was a problem child.
Ow.
Are you okay?
Six.
All right!
If I told you that I'm actually super scared of dying,
Yeah.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
She may not look it, but she gets hurt a lot easier than most people.
She was so depressed that I thought she'd never get back on her feet again.
Would you say something?!
I seriously will kill you.
So all the returned books are back where they belong.
Hey.
By Saint-Exupry?
And here I was all excited, thinking you might not know it since it's a foreign book.
tells me exactly how little you care about books.
If you ever feel like it, huh?
About the list of things I want to do before dying.
I'm just joking around with you.
But you can let go now...
Hey.
What are you doing here?
What else could it be, then?!Alt: Then what is it, huh?
Sakura!
But...
Just a little bit longer...
Come back inside. Then I can give you a change of clothes.
I'm glad to see you're doing so well.Swapped so it flows more naturally
You did lend me that book.
What does...
Being alive...
an8Kyoko?
Well, you won't have to worry about it for a while, though.Official: Well, it won't be for a while, though.
Something felt off about her in that hospital room.
And I soon found out what may have been the reason for it.
That's not what I mean!
You want me to live?
Oh, it's starting!
I told you before, remember?
Thank me.
that making a promise to do something after she got out of hospital would jinx things somehow.
Yeah?Alt: 'What?' This doesn't fit his tone of voice.
You got a girlfriend, right?
Either way, you should bring her here sometime.
Later.
No fair! No fair!
an8i1However, she died shortly after.
At that point, I had calmed down enough to be able to accept reality.Dub add 'at that point' and it makes sense to include even if not in the JP.
What?
She told me about it.
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
To the one person who knew she was sick.Literally 'about her disease'
So I thought I may as well just tell him about it.
He already knows my secret, anyway.
That yakiniku was so good!
I'm definitely going to make him understand the glory of offal before I die.Dub: Before I die, I'm definitely going to convince him that organ meats taste amazing.
They said something about numbers being off.PAR: Some numbers were wrong or something like that.
Huh?
It was...
you were afraid of making me a friend or a girlfriend.
Because you see...
Your relationships with others are what make you who you are.
That day when you were really worried about me...
I think it's pretty amazing how you're able to make someone so happy.
All the choices I made, I made just so I could meet you.Tricky to split this and keep the JP structure. PAR gave it a good try but it just doesn't sound right: To meet you. I've made my choices in life for the sake of nothing else.
It's fine. Thank you.
Huh?
You're right.
I wanted to show you this.
This is Living with Dying.
Why would you know and not me?!Dub: How come you know about something that I don't?!
Stop it.
It's because shefscx150
And if you can do that...Dub: If you ever find it in your heart to do that... This is good but I don't want to keep copying the dub.
You know how I am,
But I've finally come this far.
What's that mean?
Talk about creepy.
if she even saw it.
They were saying that in the past, if there was something wrong with your liver, you'd eat a liver,
you're the only one I can ask.
It happened in April, when the late-blooming cherry blossoms were still flush on the trees.
Pancreas?
That's mine.
I'm going to die.
You don't say.Official: Oh, I see
Normally, you'd act surprised,
You don't have anything like that?
What a coincidence!
But hold up a second.
Maybe go and meet up with your first crush.
You can't be very busy with no friends, right?Alt: Being friendless means you'd have plenty of free time, right?
Thanks, but I'll pass.
Oh?
Oh, that's not what I meant.
I just like offal.
It's amazing what humans can do.Dub: Humans can be pretty amazing sometimes, don't you think?
By the way, is there really no one in our class you're close to?Dub: do you really not get along with anyone in our class?
It's all in your head.
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
Like I said, either way, the truth doesn't really matter to me.truth added so it's clear what he means. 'it doesn't really matter' is a bit ambiguous
That's why I don't have any interest in other people.Sound weird but using  is this sense is strange anyway. Official: 'That's why I don't care about other people,'
You probably didn't mean to,insultbe rude about it
Or you sayin' you'll pay for her?
What's going on?
You lookin' for a world of hurt?!
Stop right there!
Later!
'Kay.PAR: Aight!
Okay, but I'll pass.
You told the people in class that we don't really get along well, didn't you?Dub: Whenever people asked about the two of us, you told them we weren't really friends, didn't you?
You could be right.
I highly recommend the shortcake at this place.Alt: It's gotta be the shortcake, here.
Look.
This is my best friend, Kyoko.
But, like, you've been alone with him two days in a row!
The doctors only ever give me the truth.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
is fun!
The hot weather's great, isn't it?Official: It's nice when it's hot out. PAR: Hot weather has its own charm.
Oh, and also, a romantic summer fling!PAR: fleeting summer rendezvous! This is really good, but not sure if it fits Sakura's character as well as the official.
Wait, hang on!
Get your butt back to cleaning, too.
Good morning.
In order to keep my parents from worrying,
That's cruel and sad.
All right, fine.
You really can't trust a saying, then.
Huh?
Come on, say something!
Oh, right. While you we're in the shower, I got us some drinks from the convenience store downstairs.Konbini!!!
Got it?
That means I ask you truth or dare.
I'm just a little curious about how you turned out to be the sort of person you are now.
What's the happiest thing that's ever happened in your life?Pushing it for onscreen time but it's the better line. PAR: 'What's the happiest thing you've experienced?'
Meeting you, maybe!
Which one do you want?
Thanks.
What did you get?
Truth.
But I have conditions!
Make sure you tell her I'm innocent.
What about princess-carrying me to bed?
Yeah.
It was fun.
And here I was all excited, thinking you might not know it since it's a foreign book.
Now, now, there's no need to hurry.
There we go.
Don't you want to get yourself a girlfriend?
No, I wouldn't.
is coming up.
That was embarrassing.
Are you playing along with my joke?
No...
The whole class is talking about you!
Sakura, why do care about a guy like him?
Besides, you and I...
Just a little bit longer...
I don't think there's anything I can do for you.
so it might be a while.
I was again reminded...He's thinking back to the hotel when he saw all her meds. Dub: The reality of her situation became far more clear to me than it had ever been before.
of her reality.Alt: of the reality of her situation.
Do you know why things have gotten like that?
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
I really wish you'd get along with Kyoko.
Um, could we play just one round of truth or dare?
Why?
Thanks.
Being alive, huh?
Accepting someone.
Having fun being with someone.
Are you sure nothing's bothering you?PAR: Hey, aren't you acting a little weird?
I'm all better now that you're here!
Sakura, I need to talk to him right now.
I put a change of clothes in here for you.
There's something I want you to do for me.
Well, you won't have to worry about it for a while, though.Official: Well, it won't be for a while, though.
This way!
That goes for both of us.
What is it?
Before long, the day came when the hospital let her go home.literally 'discharged' but this translation sounds more natural.
Hey.
Heading somewhere?
No, I'll pass.Alt: Thanks, but I'm good.
I felt like I'd changed.
she'd say that I chose to change myself.Alt: If you asked her, she'd probably say that it was my choice to change myself.
What!? You actually remembered that place!Email  1:18:08
That one really hurt my feelings!Email  1:18:08
Someone who can be loved.
an8i1According to reports, the girl was identified as a student at a local high school.
Here, take this.
she said he'd come to get this no matter what.
He just happened to find this book at the hospital, and started reading it.Narrated so "this Living With Dying" is not translating properly.
I've actually been curious about him for a while.
I'm definitely going to make him understand the glory of offal before I die.Dub: Before I die, I'm definitely going to convince him that organ meats taste amazing.
When I'm with him, I start to feel a little better.
And I have to stay here for at least two weeks.PAR: I ended up having to stay for two weeks.
Don't worry, I didn't write your name.Past tense since it's her will
So, how's it going?
I already let my mom know.
But our relationship couldn't be described through simple terms like love or friendship, could it?Dub: However, our relationship wasn't exactly normal, was it? It didn't classify as love or even friendship.
Here's something related to that.Dub: 'And I think I might know why that is.' This is a translation of the idea.
I always thought I was basically the same as the other hundreds of thousands of high school kids,
But...
I was happy.
What's your first name?
Haruki Shiga.
This is her book.
I won't.
It's because shefscx150
...I'd really like to be your friend!Literally more like 'become friends.' Alt: 'Maybe someday we could become friends!'; 'Iyou could be yourmy friend!' Dub: 'the two of us could become friends!'
Well, see you later.
I assume it was drowned in the tears of the many people there...
Sorry! I'm late because of extra classes.Official: I had to stay after class.
Oh, come on...
We'll have to ask her.
That's not fair! What about me?
You don't think I'm joking, do you?
That's it?!
or say something sort of comforting like, the cute ones die young.the fairest flowers soonest fade
What a coincidence!
You're always reading a book by yourself.PAR: always got your nose in a book.
Bye.
If you want, I'll spend the rest of my life hanging out with you.
But the following week,
Even though you might drop dead tomorrow, for all you know!Official: You might die tomorrow, for all you know!
Each day is worth the same as any other.
Just go with your family for yakiniku.steakhousebarbeque house is the closest thing but shouldn't be localized anyway.
Don't tell me eating cow entrails is also part of your treatment program?
When someone asks me about my favorite food, I usually say, Offal.
Top of the list: entrails!
Sure thing!Alt: 'Coming right up!' Do wait staff actually say that?
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
Enough is as good as a feast.
What perfect weather!Alt: What a beautiful day!
Are you still sulking?
Y-You're the ones who ran into her on your bikesfscx150
Hey you, stay right there, too!
Spring goes hand in hand with cherry blossoms.Spring flowers
I'm all thirsty from running, anyway. So let's go in.Dub: Come on! Arguably a good translation of the idea but the literal works fine here.
Do you know why cherry blossoms bloom in spring?
They wait for it to become warm and then bloom all at once.
Welcome back.
Sakura, what's the deal with you and that guy? relationship
Well, let me know if anything interesting happens.PAR: lemme. I dunno, not sure about this contraction in a sub.
Good morning.
Great at sports, and has both looks and smarts.
Yeah. What about it?
Keep it down.
Getting back to what I was saying, you're coming, right?
Paradise!
Never?
an8Sorry. So how much do I owe you?
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
They're desperately trying to pretend that we have a normal life.
hanging out with you
Stop reading books all the time!
The break starts tomorrow!
Huh? Is that all the stuff you're bringing?
Get there?
I told them I was going with Kyoko.
So what's your first name, anyway?
What?Dub: What's up?
By the way, I'm butt naked right now!
Well, since we're already drinking,
Who came up with this game? The devil?
Also, no asking me to do anything naughty.
I'm just going off the people I remember, but...
third, maybe?
but that's super embarrassing.
Basically, I was a problem child.
Come on...
If you say dare, you have to carry me to bed!
Thanks.
You should really drink some water.
Let's see...Alt: How about...
Want some water?
Hello?
Leave me alone.PAR: Don't play games with me.
Well, this is my stop.
I was waiting for her to contact me.
But we can't go anywhere in this rain.
Huh?
I don't really read books,
I see...
Come on!
This is one of them.
What's gotten into you?
Why...
I hear her old boyfriend was like that.
You're... You're bleeding!Blood...
Goodbye!
Everyone is where they are now because of the choices they've made.
you agreed to do the things I asked you to do.
All the choices I made until now...
and brought us together!Dub: and created the path that led us together.
For what?
Yeah.
I'm glad to see you're doing so well.Swapped so it flows more naturally
My parents just freaked out because some my numbers were a little off,PAR: Some of my numbers were a little off, so my parents got worried and made a fuss,
Has the rest of the class said anything?
Only that supposedly I've been stalking you, and that's why you've been skipping school. Literally: absent. Alt: missing; haven't been around; away. PAR: They're saying that the reason for your absence is me stalking you.
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
Accepting someone.
Where's all this coming from?
This way!
It had to be today.
You're not going to die, right?
I made you worry for nothing.
Well, you guys have fun.
I used to be completely indifferent to others,PAR: I used to not have any interest in others,  
You truly are an amazing person.
Someone who can love others.
an8i1Our next story...
Once I'd processed my feelings, I realized something.PAR: Having sorted out my feelings, something became clear to me. 
I never imagined this would be how things would play out.
I mean, Sakura left this behind for you.
He feels a bit different from everyone else.
That yakiniku was so good!
I've lost half the time I have left.PAR: My lifespan got cut in half. Being lazy again or sake of signs only version.
I don't know if I've ever been this happy to be alive before today.PAR: So happy that I could barely believe it.
that when I was alone again, the tears wouldn't stop.
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow!PAR: 'I'm getting discharged tomorrow!' Either works. Going with the dub for easy signs version.
Yaaaay!Dub: Woohoo!
Since you told me not to.PAR: You're the one who asked me not to.
I already let my mom know.
Here's something related to that.Dub: 'And I think I might know why that is.' This is a translation of the idea.
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
Just like the cherry blossoms waiting for spring!
Because we were always looking at each other.not looking in the same direction. This is emphasized in the novel but there's just no room for it here, and it's not in the JP dialogue. As it is, technically 'Because' is not here in the JP either, but I think it's needed to make point more clear. It's the translation of the idea here, anyway, so it's fine.
What's your first name?
What's your first name?
It must've been you.
Why not?
You're lying. I don't know anything about that.PAR: I would have known.
If you'd told me...
I would've spent even more time with her!
Wait up!
It was really difficult for me to reach out to other people.
Let's be happy.
No running in the library.Alt: This is a library so no running.
What are you doing?
Putting the books back.
Those are historical fiction, and this shelf is for history books.
Oh, come on...
I call it Living With Dying.
Ever since I found out I had a pancreatic disease, I started using it as a diary.
I'm going to die.
Normally, you'd act surprised,
But hold up a second.
I haven't told anyone.
You should spend that time doing whatever you want to do.PAR: You should live however you want.
What?Alt: Seriously; Really
I get where you're coming from...
I just like offal.
Even though I'm sick, it doesn't get in the way of my life at all!
No, they haven't.
but all that really got on my nerves!Dub: 'You probably didn't mean to sound so rude about it, but I'm still upset you felt the need to say it!' This is good but too much not in the JP to use this.
Y-You're the ones who ran into her on your bikesfscx150
'Scuse me? This hag was standing in the middle of the damn road!
an8Hey!
Cough up the dough already!
You're the ones at fault here!
an8Hey, could you watch the store for a bit?
Hey, look at this!Alt: Check this out!
Actually, the three of us should totally come here sometime!
Oh, come on. Just give me your phone.
I'm home.
Morning, everyone.
Thank you!
Great at sports, and has both looks and smarts.
Okay, but I'll pass.
You told the people in class that we don't really get along well, didn't you?Dub: Whenever people asked about the two of us, you told them we weren't really friends, didn't you?
Listen, are you trying to get fat?
Of course not.
I've never even had a friend.
There's no way I'd tell him that.PAR: I'd never tell my boyfriend that.
What is it?Alt: What's up?
Yeah, I told you that this morning.
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
This might be my last summer, so I gotta enjoy it to the fullest.
Oh, and also, a romantic summer fling!PAR: fleeting summer rendezvous! This is really good, but not sure if it fits Sakura's character as well as the official.
If you think everything I say means something, you couldn't be more wrong!PAR: You're gravely mistaken if you think there's a purpose to everything I say!
Don't tell me you think I'm asking because I like Yamauchi!
Well, you can just buy something when we get there.
Although I am pretty surprised your parents actually let you go on this trip.
And an overnight one at that.
So what's your first name, anyway?
The only thing not working is my pancreas!
Who came up with this game? The devil?
The one who's good at math.
Truth.
But I wasn't actually expecting you to give me a serious answer!
Truth!
Basically, I was a problem child.
Meeting you, maybe!
I can't stand up!
I can't believe you actually did that!Translates the idea best and in the most natural way. More literally: That took me by surprise!
All right!
What should I go with...
Dare.
Come home safe. And buy me a souvenir.
Yeah.
She was so depressed that I thought she'd never get back on her feet again.
You think you can do that?52:37
I don't really read books,
Sounds like you've read it, then?
No, I haven't yet, actually.
No, I wouldn't.
I'm going home.
Fooled you!
Do you really think it's okay to do something like this to a girl?!
No...
Why would Sakura be with someone like you?
Are you okay?
you should be with someone who truly cares for you, like him or Kyoko!
Besides, you and I...
It wasn't a coincidence that you and I were in the same class, either.
I don't think there's anything I can do for you.
Come back inside. Then I can give you a change of clothes.
Just give it back to me in a year.
Now I feel dumb for worrying.Swapped
Because I'm hanging out with you, right?PAR: Because I'm with you a lot, right?
Wrong.Dub: No, silly
If you did, I'm sure they'll see that you're a pretty fun guy.
You should stop that already.That hobby stop
You did lend me that book.
Let's see...Hmm...
Loving someone.
You're always
Nope, not at all.
I want to borrow your warmth!
Couldn't this night view wait until after you get out of the hospital?Added lead out to give this more onscreen time. Preferred if not for the onscreen time: If it's just for the night view, couldn't you wait until you get out of hospital?
Hey.
I just thought I'm so lucky to have someone who cares so much about me.
Aren't you glad you came?
Thank me.
I made you worry for nothing.
I didn't say that.
Part of me was afraid
I'm glad that you finally have someone who can see you for who you truly are.a lot of 'you' here
You sure are a lucky guy.
Sure, no problem.
Here!
Just leaving the house now.
Congrats on getting out of the hospital.
What's wrong? Are you sick?
You big meanie!Email  1:18:08
You truly are an amazing person.
Yeah, you're right.
an8i1She was found unconscious, in critical condition.
I'm really so glad...
Huh?
To the one person who knew she was sick.Literally 'about her disease'
So I thought I may as well just tell him about it.
That yakiniku was so good!
And lastly, to you...
Knowing that you'd eventually lose me,
Did you notice?
My charm can only be brought out when I'm with others.Official: 'My charm only exists with the people around me.' Literally it's more like: 'is not complete without someone around me.'  PAR had issues with charm and used allure. Not sure why but either works fine. If you really wanted to translate the idea, you could even go: 'my strengths'
That goes for everyone, right?
that's what being alive means to me.
I felt like I was someone truly unique for the first time in my life.PAR: 'I was able to think of myself as the one and only me out there for the first time in my life.'
Maybe I've spent 17 years waiting to be needed by you.
You know what?
Yes?Official: What is it?
I'm sorry.
But...
Thanks for coming.
Sorry.
I won't.
I'm never going to forgive you.
...I'd really like to be your friend!Literally more like 'become friends.' Alt: 'Maybe someday we could become friends!'; 'Iyou could be yourmy friend!' Dub: 'the two of us could become friends!'
to be the kind of person you were.
Someone who could accept others...Same as  1:17:13
Well, we probably won't start dating until after entrance exams.
What are you standing around for?
As proof of the life she lived,
Oh, that's right, I saw the coolest thing on TV yesterday.
and if you had a stomach problem, you'd eat a stomach.
Pancreas?
Oh, is that so?
Well then...Alt: Here.
I call it Living With Dying.
My pancreas has stopped working,
What?!
Seriously?
Something does seem to be going around.
If you want, I'll spend the rest of my life hanging out with you.
Do you even like books?
Obviously. Why wouldn't I?
What I did or didn't do today doesn't change its worth.
Sure thing!Alt: 'Coming right up!' Do wait staff actually say that?
No, not really.
Even though I'm sick, it doesn't get in the way of my life at all!
Your soul's probably really obnoxious.
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
Like I said, either way, the truth doesn't really matter to me.truth added so it's clear what he means. 'it doesn't really matter' is a bit ambiguous
Huh?
I wouldn't invite someone I'm not interested in!
I can't eat all that!
Y-You're the ones who ran into her on your bikesfscx150
Or you sayin' you'll pay for her?
I'm not sure...
Huh?
Hey, you littlefscx150
I think that's the first time... I've heard that used... literally.Official: I've never heard anybody say that and really mean it.
All right! We're going in here!
Do you know why cherry blossoms bloom in spring?
an8i1The woman died shortly after being stabbed.
Good morning.
Sakura,
And he's our hottie class rep!
I'm just saying it's a waste!
Okay, but I'll pass.
It might have been fun to have a friend or two,
but I believe that the world of fiction is more fun than reality.
She gets pretty emotional, you know.
And that wouldn't be very fun, would it?
So that's why
The hot weather's great, isn't it?Official: It's nice when it's hot out. PAR: Hot weather has its own charm.
A youthful summer's mistake.
So in other words,
We're not.
But you two seem to be pretty close lately.
Something happen?
FYI, I'm into more refined girls.Not sure about FYI but it fits well.
Go and throw this away.
Change of clothes?
they usually tear up and agree.
I guess that also explains why you'll survive and I'll die.
Then...PAR: In that case...
They said it was their fault, so they gave us a way better room than what we paid for!literally: than what Iwe had bookedreserved.
Are you stupid?Official: Don't be stupid?
Oh, right. While you we're in the shower, I got us some drinks from the convenience store downstairs.Konbini!!!
Well, since we're already drinking,
why don't we play truth or dare?
All right!
Truth.
Okay, let's start with...
If you don't want to answer, you can switch to dare.
I think that one girl is pretty.
Truth or dare?
This is pretty nerve-racking!No way to make a statement with heart racing sound natural
What?
I'm just a little curious about how you turned out to be the sort of person you are now.
What's the saddest thing that's happened in your life?most painfulheart-breaking
Come on...
so can you pick one?
Thanks.
You should really drink some water.
Want some water?
If I...
what would you do?
I knew I could count on you, Kyoko. Thanks.
And also,
What?!
How do you actually feel about Sakura?PAR: 'What is Sakura to you?'
Sorry.
But we can't go anywhere in this rain.
Come over to my place today.
It's really good, so I want to hear what you think about it!impression; thoughts; what you have to say about it.
You'd never want me as your girlfriend, no matter what, right?Dub: Am I right in saying that you have absolutely no interest in me as a girlfriend?
Way to wipe out!
Where's this coming from?
Did I make your heart race?Alt: Did I make you nervous?
I'm serious, stop it!PAR: Stop already!
No, I don't.
Why would Sakura be with someone like you?
What else could it be, then?!Alt: Then what is it, huh?
Either way, we're not in the kind of relationship you and the rest of the class think it is.Dub: I'm trying to tell you that you and the rest of the classmates are making something out of nothing
And yet Sakura'sshe's still spending her time with you.
What... are you doing?
You're... You're bleeding!Blood...
That's not true!
It wasn't a coincidence.
you agreed to do the things I asked you to do.
I'm sorry... about before.
I always read books in the order they're placed on the bookshelf,
Because the next thing I knew, she was in hospital.hospitalized.
was slowly but surely eating her up inside.
I really wish you'd get along with Kyoko.
Okay.
It's embarrassing me.
Hey...
I just want to enjoy the truth and the normal life that you give me.PAR: I just want a taste of your reality and normalcy.
Yeah.
Sakura, don't talk like that.More literally: Don't talk about dying.
Well, you won't have to worry about it for a while, though.Official: Well, it won't be for a while, though.
Is this some kind of prank?
You're not going to die, right?
That's not what I mean.
Thank me.
That's pretty arrogant for an apology.
You got a girlfriend, right?
Huh?
I'm glad that you finally have someone who can see you for who you truly are.a lot of 'you' here
Heading somewhere?
Stop it! I said stop it!
What!? You actually remembered that place!Email  1:18:08
You big meanie!Email  1:18:08
Someone who can be loved.
How can I be like you?
She...
Go and give her a proper goodbye.
In life,Before she died ?
What?
She kept it a secret from everyone in class except me.Alt: she didn't tell anyone in class except me.
I just need a moment.Alt: I'll just go get it, so just a moment. Literally just: wait a moment, could you
Do you mind if I look through it?
But he's actually a lot of fun to talk to,
He feels a bit different from everyone else.
Then Kyoko surprised me by showing up out of nowhere!
Now it's time to enjoy the rest of my life!The dub. It doesn't quite translate the idea but it's ok. Alt: Now I can enjoy the time I still have left!
I'm giving this book to you.PAR: This book is yours now.
Did you notice?
That day when you were really worried about me...
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
I would've quit the club I was in, and school, too!Dub: skipped classes.
Yeah, right!
Well, we probably won't start dating until after entrance exams.
Just a single sentence.
I have no idea
Sorry! I'm late because of extra classes.Official: I had to stay after class.
No running in the library.Alt: This is a library so no running.
Whatever you say.
What?! There's too many, though!
Oh, that's right, I saw the coolest thing on TV yesterday.
That's not fair! What about me?
an8i1Ticket holder 54, please proceed to counter A2.
I call it Living With Dying.
Okay, I get it.
Just one last thing.
I haven't told anyone.
But the following week,
What were you expecting?
I suppose I do.
Weren't you the one who told me to do whatever I wanted to do?
and apparently, there's people in other countries who believe that if you have someone eat you,foreign countries is what she says but that makes little sense in English
Your soul's probably really obnoxious.
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
Who knows?
What's that mean?
I'm happy to let all my relationships outside of family, to begin and end in my head.
What's going on?
an8Hey! Say something!
an8Hey!
You're the ones at fault here!
Apologize to her!
Let's go!PAR: Let's scram! Nice, but I've never heard someone say that.
H-Hey, wait
Why... did you have to go... and do something like that?
so we need to make sure we can talk as much as possible.PAR: so we have to make sure to keep close frequent contact.
Morning, everyone.
an8Yo!
And he's our hottie class rep!
I told you in my message, we should get along well until I die.Not a direct quote
You could be right.
Paradise!
I told you, you should be going here with your girlfriends.
You've never wanted friends or a girlfriend?
I wonder.
You know, I...
but he didn't really work out as a boyfriend.
What is it?Alt: What's up?
Shouldn't you be going with them?
I'll make you spit it out tomorrow, okay?
an8Sorry. So how much do I owe you?
She gets pretty emotional, you know.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
hanging out with you
A fleeting summer's love.
But you two seem to be pretty close lately.
FYI, I'm into more refined girls.Not sure about FYI but it fits well.
Go and throw this away.
I'll keep that in mind.PAR: I'll remember that
What?Dub: What's up?
why don't we play truth or dare?
That means I ask you truth or dare.
Truth.
By the way, if you pick dare,
Oh, you mean Hina!
I'm not sure what's obvious about it.
Then, truth or dare?
My strength is being able to get along with everyone.
Come on...
Carry-me-to-bed!
What did you get?
What should I go with...
Truth or dare?
Dare.
What? Who's with you?
So you actually had fun, did you?
What?
After the break was over, though, all that awaited me
She was the same when her favorite teacher moved away, transferred. It can mean change jobs which is how PAR translated but transferred is more likely.
Don't get close to her with half-baked feelings.
If you do anything to hurt her...
Sorry.
Aren't you curious about what it is?
The books you like tend to say a lot about who you are as a human being.Copy of the dub, which is the best translation. PAR: I think a person's favorite book says a lot about them.
tells me exactly how little you care about books.
Come on!
Oh, you can grab an item there.
This is one of them.
You'd fit that role just fine. could mean multiple things. Gone with the official stuff.
What were you thinking?
But you can let go now...
Why would Sakura be with someone like you?
The two of you go off to eat together, go on trips together,
It might do you some good.
Are you okay?
Sakura, why do care about a guy like him?
A guy like him? What do you mean?
He's refusing to leave you alone, which pisses me off,
If I'd kept to myself, nobody would've gotten hurt!
I want you to stay with me.
We can't even go to the festival on the weekend.
It totally sucks.
Nobody wants to talk to a boring classmate.
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
I really wish you'd get along with Kyoko.
Show a bit more interest in my life!
Where's all this coming from?
Hey, what are you two doing?!
an8Kyoko?
Should you really have left the hospital?Line break for quicker reading. Official: Is it okay for you to leave the hospital?
Yeah.
Here.
Thank me.
I'm glad that you finally have someone who can see you for who you truly are.a lot of 'you' here
You sure are a lucky guy.
Okay, fine! I'll buy you one.
That gum...
Sure, no problem.
Here!
I bet if you asked her,
I chose to go along with whatever she said. invitation. It does make sense but definitely not natural. 'whatever she said' is the idea here.
Just leaving the house now.
I'm waiting for you at Cafe Spring.
The complete opposite of me.
an8i1Our next story...
an8i1was found collapsed on a road with a stab wound to the chest.
She wanted me to pass on this diary to a certain person after she died.
I started crying, both out of embarrassment and relief that he'd actually come.PAR: I was so embarrassed, and so relieved that he came, that tears came out.
Because you see...
You really are an amazing person.
Your relationships with others are what make you who you are.
You created your own charm,
I think it's pretty amazing how you're able to make someone so happy.
is it okay if I cry now?
Because we were always looking at each other.not looking in the same direction. This is emphasized in the novel but there's just no room for it here, and it's not in the JP dialogue. As it is, technically 'Because' is not here in the JP either, but I think it's needed to make point more clear. It's the translation of the idea here, anyway, so it's fine.
Thank you.
What's your first name?
That's...
This is her book.
Stop it.
I want you to read this.
It's because shefscx150
And if you can do that...Dub: If you ever find it in your heart to do that... This is good but I don't want to keep copying the dub.
so I'm going to start off by complaining.
Let's be happy.
Those are historical fiction, and this shelf is for history books.
and if you had a stomach problem, you'd eat a stomach.
Sorry, sorry.
Okay, I get it.
I'm good.
I thought we'd never have anything to do with each other again.Official: I thought I'd never talk to her again.
Nothing, really.
Yet you're not doing them right now.
You can't be very busy with no friends, right?Alt: Being friendless means you'd have plenty of free time, right?
That's sweetbread. You know, the pancreas.
I just like offal.
and apparently, there's people in other countries who believe that if you have someone eat you,foreign countries is what she says but that makes little sense in English
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
It's all in your head.
It doesn't matter if it's actually true or not.
What's that mean?
It's up to my imagination whether someone likes me or hates me.
it doesn't matter if they like me or hate me.
'Scuse me? This hag was standing in the middle of the damn road!
What's going on?
an8Hey!
Let's go around.
an8Hey!
Nice one!
Hey, give me your contact info!
Welcome back.
Want some dinner?
'Kay.PAR: Aight!
Getting back to what I was saying, you're coming, right?
I highly recommend the shortcake at this place.Alt: It's gotta be the shortcake, here.
I've never even had a friend.
What's that even supposed to mean?!
Kyoko! We're leaving!PAR: heading out
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
and still lets me have a normal life.
Nice idea, I'm in!sounds good
I'll pass.Alt: No, thanks.
I-I just thought I'd give him some gum.
Is there anyplace you'd like to visit?
No, I'm sure of it!
Yes?
I'll be sleeping over here.
Thanks.
I won't go easy on you.
The one who's good at math.
So girls like that are your type, huh?
So what about me then?
Truth!
What were you like when you were a little kid?
Carry-me-to-bed!
Iffy!
What about princess-carrying me to bed?
She may not look it, but she gets hurt a lot easier than most people.
She was so depressed that I thought she'd never get back on her feet again.
and when her parents had a huge fightfscx150
Want to come over to my place today?
What book is it?
If I ever feel like it.
Yeah?
You'd never want me as your girlfriend, no matter what, right?Dub: Am I right in saying that you have absolutely no interest in me as a girlfriend?
Way to wipe out!
This is a hug.
I'm just joking around with you.
Like I always do.
Stop it!
No, I don't.
What are you doing here?
Why would Sakura be with someone like you?
Hey!
But you have to know...
I'm really sorry about before.
Yeah.
Has the rest of the class said anything?
If you did, I'm sure they'll see that you're a pretty fun guy.
I didn't see that coming.
Okay, go ahead. Ask me anything.
Having fun being with someone.
Sakura, I need to talk to him right now.
Honestly...
Yeah.
I put a change of clothes in here for you.
I'll admit confession.
Is this some kind of prank?
It's fine, don't worry.
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
No, I'll pass.Alt: Thanks, but I'm good.
Then you should've bought an ice pop instead of those things!
All right! Let's go find what we want.Literally just, 'let's go choose'
Sure, no problem.
Here!
I felt like I'd changed.
I bet if you asked her,
Sorry!
Just leaving the house now.
Isn't that right nearby?
an8i1However, she died shortly after.
and face the end of the story.
Um...
I never imagined this would be how things would play out.
I'm so glad you came.
But he wasn't surprised by it at all.PAR: But he was completely unfazed.
It's like he's engaged in a silent battle against himself.PAR: and I get the feeling he's struggling with himself.
Then Kyoko surprised me by showing up out of nowhere!
that when I was alone again, the tears wouldn't stop.
And lastly, to you...
So I'm glad that we became so close.
Were you scared of turning me into someone important in your mind?
i1Like you say, I'm just a coward.
You created your own charm,
You, who has no need for relationships like friendship or love,
I think it's pretty amazing how you're able to make someone so happy.
But I shouldn't be using an expression like that.Official: But that doesn't really get the idea across, does it?
It must've been you.
And by the way,This could be anything that fits really. She like trying to get his attention in a rudepushy way. So explain to me. Tell me.
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
Thanks for coming.
I want you to read this.
I want you to forgive me.
You know how I am,
But you're no longer here.I think this is connected to the previous line, not the following, but not sure how to work it that way.
I mean in general.
Let's go to Sakura's place already.
The funeral of my classmate, Yamauchi SakuraSakura Yamauchi,
I stayed at home.
Same difference!
Keep it down.
Oh, come on...
Huh?
Ever since I found out I had a pancreatic disease, I started using it as a diary.
My pancreas has stopped working,
and pretty soon...
Sorry, sorry.
Anyway, I have to go to the front desk.
But the following week,
Obviously. Why wouldn't I?
Oh, that's right!
Where is this coming from?
What?
Hey mister! More tripe and heart please!
No, not really.
I did a bit more research,If I had the onscreen time add: 'on that stuff we talked about'. Literally she just says: 'I researchedinvestigated after that'. Really dosen't make much sense.
your soul lives on inside them.
Your soul's probably really obnoxious.
It's my hobby to imagine how others see me as a person.
I'm happy to let all my relationships outside of family, to begin and end in my head.
Huh?
Ouch, that gotta hurt.
Ow!
No, thanks.
Thanks for hanging out with me.Dub: Thanks a lot for hanging out with me today.
an8Yo!
an8Let me copy your homework!
Oh, come on, what's that supposed to mean?
Complete opposites!
Never?
As you can see, she's pretty strong-willed,
Nah, it's fine.Dub: It's better that way.
You're probably the only one
who can give me the truth and a normal life.reality actually fits better as PAR used, but it doesn't work with "a normal life".
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
You need to spend more time reaching out to people!Alt: 'Use that time to reach out to people!'  reach out to; interact; connect with. Distant synonym: socialize
Finally!
All right, let's meet up at the station tomorrow morning!
Although I am pretty surprised your parents actually let you go on this trip.
I told them I was going with Kyoko.
I'll call them later and say I'm staying at a friend's house.
I guess that also explains why you'll survive and I'll die.
Hey!
Talk about awkward!Literally: 'it's embarrassing.' She means the silence.
Thanks.
You're not allowed to quit partway.
Yay!
I'm just going off the people I remember, but...
Then, truth or dare?
Shut up.
My childhood, huh?
Thirteen.
If you say dare, you have to carry me to bed!
The one next to my glass.
Truth or dare?
what would you do?
They called here, and I had a really hard time trying to cover for you!, you know!
Your boyfriend?
i1I'll tell him.
Make sure you tell her I'm innocent.
Well, that was over quick.
Yeah.
What?
She may not look it, but she gets hurt a lot easier than most people.
Huh?
A little.
What? You know it?
Eat my dust!
Hey.
Don't you want to get yourself a girlfriend?
The naughty part
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I was just talking to him about you.
so I took care of him for you!
If I'd kept to myself, nobody would've gotten hurt!
Then what was it?
And then
For what?
I always read books in the order they're placed on the bookshelf,
of her reality.Alt: of the reality of her situation.
I'm glad to see you're doing so well.Swapped so it flows more naturally
You're better off getting along with everyone in class.
Why bother doing anything if it's not going to benefit anyone?
Holding someone's hand.
You'll have plenty of time for that later!Literally more like: 'I'll give you'... but that doesn't fit here
Sakura!
that I was scared out of my mind.
It's fine, don't worry.
You can see this place from the hospital!
If you mean from my pancreas not working, well then, yeah, I will.
You want me to live?
Very much.
Aren't you glad you came?
I made you worry for nothing.
So...
Man, it's hot today.
Later.
No fair! No fair!
Sure, no problem.
Nice catch!
I felt like I'd changed.
Now you have to compliment me as punishment!
A person like that.Official: That's the kind of person you are.
an8i1He announced that they are working to swiftly resolve the situation.
Are you okay?
I knew about her illness.
I'm so glad...
I'm so glad you came.
I'm easy like that! Pushing it for onscreen time but don't like this bleeding over.
I was hospitalized.
I'm a little...
I started crying, both out of embarrassment and relief that he'd actually come.PAR: I was so embarrassed, and so relieved that he came, that tears came out.
To be completely honest,
Here's something related to that.Dub: 'And I think I might know why that is.' This is a translation of the idea.
I'll tell you what I wanted to ask you.
except that I'd have a slightly shorter lifespan than most people.'most' added. Not needed but sounds better. Dub: 'The only thing different about me was that I had a slightly shorter lifespan than everyone else I knew.' It's good, but so much of this isn't in the JP. Arguable that it's an excellent translation of the idea expreseed in the JP though.
You know what?
I was happy.
Because we were always looking at each other.not looking in the same direction. This is emphasized in the novel but there's just no room for it here, and it's not in the JP dialogue. As it is, technically 'Because' is not here in the JP either, but I think it's needed to make point more clear. It's the translation of the idea here, anyway, so it's fine.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry.
That's Sakura's handwriting...
You're lying. I don't know anything about that.PAR: I would have known.
Not Sakura! I mean you!
It was really difficult for me to reach out to other people.
But you're no longer here.I think this is connected to the previous line, not the following, but not sure how to work it that way.
Let's be happy.
As proof of the life she lived,
if she even saw it.
Sorry! I'm late because of extra classes.Official: I had to stay after class.
No running in the library.Alt: This is a library so no running.
Nobody? Are you getting into cannibalism?PAR: Excuse me? Did you suddenly realize you're a cannibal?
Oh, come on...
It happened in April, when the late-blooming cherry blossoms were still flush on the trees.
I was absent from school to get my stitches removed after an appendectomy.
Pancreas?
Die?
an8i1I repeat.
It's not like I have anyone to tell anyway.Extra lead in to better match visuals
and I'll do you the favor of letting you come along!Dub: And... you're the lucky one who gets to do them with me!
By the way, is there really no one in our class you're close to?Dub: do you really not get along with anyone in our class?
It's up to my imagination whether someone likes me or hates me.
Let's go around.
Can't you read that sign?
Huh?
Hey, you littlefscx150
Spring goes hand in hand with cherry blossoms.Spring flowers
I'm all thirsty from running, anyway. So let's go in.Dub: Come on! Arguably a good translation of the idea but the literal works fine here.
Actually, the three of us should totally come here sometime!
Let's get along well until I die!Dub: 'Be my friend until I die, okay?' This is hard to translate in a natural way but the idea she's trying to get across is probably about getting along well so they can go through her bucket list together. So a possible alt: "I hope we can keep hanging out together until I die!"
I found that band's CD you were talking about at a shop near the station.
Wow! This thing's out of print, so it's super rare!
an8Yo!
Oh, come on, what's that supposed to mean?
Complete opposites!
You've never wanted friends or a girlfriend?
I wonder.
I'm pretty sure that if Kyoko and the others found out, they'd start acting distant in the same way.Keyframe snap?
But you're the one person who knows the truth
Thanks.
FYI, I'm into more refined girls.Not sure about FYI but it fits well.
Quit slacking off!
I-I wasn't slacking off!
So you really were slacking off.
I didn't kick you that hard!
Just go to some place you've wanted to visit before you die.
Uniqlo?
And an overnight one at that.
What?
You don't always get a nice room like this, so you have to try the bed too!Experience or enjoy the bed
For now just reply truth.
If you don't want to answer, you can switch to dare.
Who came up with this game? The devil?
Oh? So you've been looking at me thinking that I'm the third-cutest in class?
But I wasn't actually expecting you to give me a serious answer!
What hobby have you kept up the longest?
My strength is being able to get along with everyone.
What's the happiest thing that's ever happened in your life?Pushing it for onscreen time but it's the better line. PAR: 'What's the happiest thing you've experienced?'
Meeting you, maybe!
Hey, is this some kind of interview?
Come on...
The one closest to me.
Sure, I don't mind.
Truth or dare?
If I...
Your boyfriend?
I'll make sure I explain all of this to you someday.
So even if you can't accept it, please forgive me.
i1I'll tell him.
Yeah.
Well, this is my stop.
Let's go on another trip sometime.
It was fun.
I was waiting for her to contact me.
Your place is in the opposite direction from mine, so no.? You live 
I see...
Oh, you can grab an item there.
Now, now, there's no need to hurry.
Where's this coming from?
About the list of things I want to do before dying.
You'd fit that role just fine. could mean multiple things. Gone with the official stuff.
You weren't saying anything, which made it seem like this was serious.PAR: The mood got all serious because you wouldn't say anything!
Did I make your heart race?Alt: Did I make you nervous?
Do you really think it's okay to do something like this to a girl?!
It's Sakura, right?
and today you even went to her house!
Sakura!
That's not true!
you should be with someone who truly cares for you, like him or Kyoko!
Then what was it?
All the choices I made until now...
I want you to stay with me.

Um, could we play just one round of truth or dare?
You did lend me that book.
Thanks.
I didn't see that coming.
You need to start with an interest in othersfscx150
My heart only exists because of everyone else in my life.Alt: around me
This isn't a prank.joke sounds like it could be interpreted in a few different ways
Hey, Mom...
Okay.

I knew this spot would be a hidden gem.PAR: I knew it had to be a little-known spot.
Come on, you're not being very honest.
Later.
Want some gum?
I'm waiting for you at Cafe Spring.
You truly are alphaHFFan amazing person.
The complete opposite of me.
Someone who can be accepted.
Isn't that right nearby?
an8i1According to reports, the girl was identified as a student at a local high school.
an8i1was found collapsed on a road with a stab wound to the chest.
What's wrong?
an8i1The suspect fled, but was later arrested and has admitted to the crime.
She broke her promise of telling me when she was going to die.
I had to pull myself together...suck it up
Sakura truly did a lot for me.
There was one other thing I wanted to do, besides pay my respects.PAR: I actually have something else to ask.
Do you mind if I look through it?
To the one person who knew she was sick.Literally 'about her disease'
But...
Thank you.
I've actually been curious about him for a while.
He feels a bit different from everyone else.
Today was awful, but great at the same time.
Now it's time to enjoy the rest of my life!The dub. It doesn't quite translate the idea but it's ok. Alt: Now I can enjoy the time I still have left!
Thank you very much.
So I'm glad that we became so close.
there were plenty of times when I thought I'd fallen in love with you.
But our relationship couldn't be described through simple terms like love or friendship, could it?Dub: However, our relationship wasn't exactly normal, was it? It didn't classify as love or even friendship.
You really are an amazing person.
Your relationships with others are what make you who you are.
You know what?
Because we were always looking at each other.not looking in the same direction. This is emphasized in the novel but there's just no room for it here, and it's not in the JP dialogue. As it is, technically 'Because' is not here in the JP either, but I think it's needed to make point more clear. It's the translation of the idea here, anyway, so it's fine.
you didn't come to Sakura's funeral., did you?
I think this is the first time we've really talked, huh?
Stop it.
Sakura...
No matter how much Sakura loved you, cared about you, or needed you,Official: No matter how much Sakura liked you, how important you were to her, how much she needed you...
I'm never going to forgive you.
to be the kind of person you were.
Let's be happy.
Thanks.
This is the last message I ever sent her.It's an email, so message works best here.
What are you doing?
What?! There's too many, though!
I call it Living With Dying.
Ever since I found out I had a pancreatic disease, I started using it as a diary.
I'm going to be late for the streetcar.I'd go with tram but American English is preferred, and trolley just reminds me of a shopping cart.
I want you to keep my illness a secret.
But the following week,
she volunteered to fill the open position in the library, for whatever reason.
I have fun doing normal stuff just like this!
Don't be like that. Here, eat some more offal.Dub: organ meats
Don't you have any dietary restrictions?
That's true.PAR: 'I bet.' Doesn't quite feel right here.
Then, what do you think about how I see you?
Y-You're the ones who ran into her on your bikesfscx150
an8Are you deaf?
In front of all these people?
Why... did you have to go... and do something like that?
Isn't that wonderful?
an8i1Tomorrow, all across Japan...
It was so much fun!
I found that band's CD you were talking about at a shop near the station.
an8Good morning.
We're in a library.
I'm not trying to do either!
Never?
He was kind of pushy in a lot of ways.
This is my best friend, Kyoko.
This might be my last summer, so I gotta enjoy it to the fullest.
Oh, and also a romantic summer fling!PAR: fleeting summer rendezvous! This is really good, but not sure if it fits Sakura's character as well as the official.
Hey, Sakura.
Go and throw this away.
The break starts tomorrow!
Good morning.
Yeah.
What about a change of clothes?
Although I am pretty surprised your parents actually let you go on this trip.
Hey, so about your last name...
Hey...
So what's your first name, anyway?
All right, fine.
Anyway, things have gotten pretty dangerous lately.
an8What?!
What?Dub: What's up?
Wait, this is...
If I had to go with someone...
So girls like that are your type, huh?
Truth or dare?
Are you okay?
so can you pick one?
The next round will be the last.
What did you get?
Six.
Truth or dare?
Sleep on the bed with me.Alt: Sleep on the bed too
i1Sakura! Where the hell are you?!
Good morning, Kyoko.
Your boyfriend?
I'll make sure I explain all of this to you someday.
Oh, so that's what it's called.
And then it occurred to me.Dub: 'And then it hit me.' Most natural, but not sure how well this reads as subs.
In junior high, she spent the whole night crying after breaking up with her boyfriend.
and when her parents had a huge fightfscx150
How do you actually feel about Sakura?PAR: 'What is Sakura to you?'
Don't get close to her with half-baked feelings.
But we can't go anywhere in this rain.
Your place is in the opposite direction from mine, so no.? You live 
It's really good, so I want to hear what you think about it!impression; thoughts; what you have to say about it.
Come on!
Lend me that book.
You'd fit that role just fine. could mean multiple things. Gone with the official stuff.
Stop it!
The two of you go off to eat together, go on trips together,
It might do you some good.
Apparently she doesn't like guys who won't take no for an answer.Official: who are too pushy.
What a coincidence.
You're awful!You disgust me!
It wasn't a coincidence that you and I were in the same class, either.
That's just your interpretation.Alt: 'That's just the way you see it.'; 'That's just your take on it.' 
You like books, so you picked it up out of curiosity.
When we'd gotten about halfway through her list,
Has the rest of the class said anything?
Wrong.Dub: No, silly
Really?
Want to hear about my first kiss?
Hating someone.
I just want to enjoy the truth and the normal life that you give me.PAR: I just want a taste of your reality and normalcy.
Sakura, I need to talk to him right now.
Something felt off about her in that hospital room.
I'll admit confession.
It's fine, don't worry.
You can see this place from the hospital!
I knew this spot would be a hidden gem.PAR: I knew it had to be a little-known spot.
That's not what I mean!
Don't worry.
When I'm going to die, I'll be sure to let you know.
Come on, you're not being very honest.Alt: Come one, you can come clean about it.
You sure are a lucky guy.
Okay, fine! I'll buy you one.
Yeah!
Sure, no problem.
she'd say that I chose to change myself.Alt: If you asked her, she'd probably say that it was my choice to change myself.
You truly are an amazing person.
How can I be like you?
Thank you. Have a nice evening.Any acceptable western parting would be fine except 'Come again.' Apu

So...
There was one other thing I wanted to do, besides pay my respects.PAR: I actually have something else to ask.
But he wasn't surprised by it at all.PAR: But he was completely unfazed.
He doesn't seem to have many friends, so he'll probably keep it to himself.
No, I won't lie here.Dub: Well, there's no point in me lying here.
I was so, so happy,
I'm sure that what she wanted you to read is further in.
Since you told me not to.PAR: You're the one who asked me not to.
I already let my mom know.
Here's something related to that.Dub: 'And I think I might know why that is.' This is a translation of the idea.
Why don't you ever call me by my name?
Knowing that you'd eventually lose me,
If I'm right, leave an offering or something by my grave.
You really are an amazing person.
I felt like I was someone truly unique for the first time in my life.PAR: 'I was able to think of myself as the one and only me out there for the first time in my life.'
You see, I wanted to tell you before I died.
Oh, right.
You and I really are...
You know, cherry blossoms and spring.
That's...
Her Will...
Someday...Dub: Maybe someday...
So that's how it is.
How nostalgic!
You can keep it.
I've just moved recently.
SCHOOOOOOOOOOL! 
Eh?
Hup!
One female resident unaccounted for!
Keep calm!
I'll get you to safety!
Can my board come too?
Good work!
That board's important to you, right?
how you ride the waves.
Riding the waves!
You've got a good build, so I'm sure you'll get better than me!
So it spread up through the balconies real quick.
It's Hinageshi.
I see. By the way, during a fire it's best to head for lower ground if possible.
Is that a finless porpoise?
It does look kind of like a Barchetta doesn't it!
Woah!
Until... Cool...
That's amazing!
Lookin' good, lookin' good! This time for sure!
I mean Minato, I'm sure you'll come to my rescue.
It's old manually operated machinery after all.
The machinery there is a bit more modern.
Eh?
But I feel like we'll get along well!
My immune system's pretty tough so I'll be fine!
But,
You can see Mt. Fuji!
I can too! I have never seen this phrase used until today, interesting.
Then?
What was that?
Come here!
Key to the heart...
I'm moving out of my parents place.
That's still a bit...
Is that sarcasm?
But by chance one day.
Until you'll be able to ride the waves yourself...
You're there, aren't you!
This new place is quite far from the sea, huh.
Here's the stuff left at my brother's place.
I never thought he would...
It was me...
Stop that.
I'm leaving everything here so do what you want with it.
In fact it's better if you do!
Why can't you make yourself available and get in reception range!
Didn't you say that you'd always be by my side?!
Here.
Even though you'd always call us dumb love-birds.
There's a passcode so I can't check inside...
Stay right there!
Hey now, listen up!
Can you see it? Minato in the water...
Look look!
How?
It seemed like those two couldn't see you though.
Ah, that's right!
That day...
That was surprising!
Whaat?
I want to see you surfing.
Whether it's the sea or anything else.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
It's alright!
No, see...
But, she was Minato's girlfriend, so...
I was, worried about the current Hinako.
No need for the towel right now, it's not too bad.
Or that plastic finless porpoise.
I noticed when you came to the department
and in other places as well...
though it was hard to call out to you.
Um! These are for you!
Then the person who liked the sea...
He said he likes me!
or even kiss you...
Minato! If Minato were here he'd definitely save him!
What's wrong?
I can see him!
But...
He told me...
What do I do...
No way!
It's nothing.
Your parents?
But he read books,
I rode the waves after a snowfall
That you will be able to ride your own wave
And...
We get surfers, as well as people who can't swim but still want to try.
You run when you're off duty too?
Ever since then,
When duty calls, we contact the emergency services, as well as bring an AED.
This is a first for me!
Anyone got earplugs?
Manager, I'll be heading out early today!
Did you know that there was a fire in a half-finished building a year ago?
Well it seems these guys were the culprits.
They were talking about going to set off fireworks again.
Nice view!
I'll be going all out tonight!
Whaat? Can't hear you!
Entrance established on east side through ladder!
Entering through there now!
I'll never again...
Until you... Managed to ride your own wave...
Take care of mom and dad!
Right!
You write a message on a heart shaped card!
You two should go do it!
Ah, well then, see you later!
Seems there'll be no more waves for today.
Let's head back.
Hinako? Have you cleaned your room?
Hold steady!
Um, here, it's an extra
I've just moved recently
Do you have the address?
It's called "Sunrise Katamiya"
then make a left after two blocks,
Ongoing fire in the apartment next door
Collar, check!
Uhm... Phone!
Ah! My wallet!
Fire point! 6th floor outer stairs!
Teams 2 and 3, confirm location of the missing woman!
Resident number 21 confirmed! Please lower the crane!
Unlicensed use of fireworks, not to mention trespassing?!
Everything's fine now
That board's important to you, right?
Haha, see ya!
Use those legs! Keep at it!
Hinageshi, Minato
Is that a finless porpoise?
I felt it'd help me improve quicker
Until... Cool...
Starting from there?
Ah, yeah
Ahh!
Do you want to...
Just kidding!
Tada!
Quite aggressive too
Then I guess Youko would be a Blue-Ringed Octopus?
Small but has spit full of deadly tetrodotoxin!
It's Mt. Fuji!
Amazing!
It seems you can reserve a message to be played for you in advance
Think we can see our area from here?
Eh?
Besides, I wanted it to be just the two of us
There wasn't really anything I was good at
They hatch on the beach
Swim, rest when you're tired
No way!
Hinako-san!
Please open the door!
Sorry for coming over all of a sudden...
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help...
It's fine
You two are both so nice...
I just want to know...
And what about your birthday, Youko-chan?
Not the day of the fire, or the day we went surfing...
The hell are you doing?!
Sorry for having a sharp tongue
Well, that's just fine in its own way
If I... sing that song...
In the head?
How?
A bit painful...
It seemed like those two couldn't see you though
Okay
Are you alright?
I was just thinking how I can't even hold your hand like this...
One more
Will you forgive me now?
I'm good with you, Minato!
Ah... I was curious...
I was, worried about the current Hinako-san
Woah!
Ah, sorry, that was just me talking to myself!
What's wrong, Hinako?
What about Wasabi?
And how about you?
I can't even hold your hand, Hinako
Ah!
Can't you hear it? Minato's voice...
I know but...
I'm so sorry Minato!
I kept calling for you over and over!
I'm so sorry!
That's amazing, Youko-chan!
Did he mention anything else?
Huh?
So I will realize that dream
We were like night and day
Was that when he was little and was saved from being drowned
I'm turning you on your side, bring your knees up!
You were saved by this little girl here!
Are you interested in lifesaving?
He said that prevention was the best way to fight fires
Indeed...
Why did you want to become a firefighter, Wasabi?
Idiot, those were the very same words you said to me before
But thanks to what you said
I was saved by you, Wasabi!
I've always liked you!
Chest compressions. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
About 5 cm, pushing further is also dangerous
As you... Gaze!
They'll shoot out from the building like the new year's fireworks in Taiwan or Shanghai!
We'll need earplugs though
Haha, you're fine with just being Honored?
There's a great abandoned building!
I can't wait!
The place that had the world's largest Christmas tree!
That's huge...
I'll be going all out tonight!
It's too dark!
Youko-chan let's get down from here!
What's that supposed to mean?
Roger!
Hinako
Ride your wave!
Thanks, Youko-chan!
Let's not have any more reckless stunts
Merry Christmas, Hinako-san!
Hello!
She's back.
Don't worry, I'll be fine! I'll call you back, okay?
Direct attack!
It's called Sunrise Katamiya. Oh!
I'm sorry, I'd really like to but I'm on duty, right now.
Don't get lost, hero lady!
Coat on! Collar on!
Someone set off a bunch of professional fireworks.
Are you injured?
Good job. Hooyah!
Sorry. I got you in trouble.
riding the waves.
I can see you from the rooftop.
See ya. Say, umm...
Another shot!
Keep a cool head!
Only those with enough grit to push on through can ever reach that level.
Later. Minato...
I'm off to ride some waves.
Take care in there.
Seriously, though...
They were setting off fireworks from a building site, right?
I'm sorry. I still don't know how your name is read.
They play it quite often since it was used in that film.
It keeps on glistening in the sun
now paddle, paddle, paddle!
Now, pop up!
you're basically like a hero, aren't you, Hinageshi-san.
WATER DRIP - PAPER DRIP NEL DRIP - FRENCH DRIP
The next wave is always just on the horizon, waiting to be caught.
Minato, that if ever I'm in trouble, you'll be there to save me.
Don't worry. It's okay.
We're on our way to watch the fireworks.
Now have a taste.
You two are syrupy enough as it is.
I think we'll get on fine.
I'm leaving.
That attitude of hers doesn't help when it comes to making friends.
But she recently started going again.
Is that right?
They read out big messages if you book a slot far enough in advance.
My, my...
Say...
What a queue for photos.
You know, after a good snowfall, you get these great big waves.
Well, I haven't thought that far ahead yet.
I've never been especially good at anything.
A sea turtle?
SEA TURTLES LAY THEIR EGGS HERE.
Hinako!
These are some of the things my brother was keeping at the station.
iMinato?i
and that all the normies out there could explode.
And "Disaster Prevention Day"? September 1st.
I've seen babies that cry less than you! Yoko, come on.
I just saw... Minato.
The water I see you looking out on!
The water I see you looking out on
Minato!
Why though...?
I guess maybe it does...
It might be that my wish came true.
Is something the matter?
I can't help you like that guy did earlier, either.
I'm not going to cheat, okay?
You're the only one, Minato. That's not what I meant.
Nope.
Right now, you're being pushed back by that power a little.
You have to prepare yourself for the next one, though.
You're not?
Boss. I'm coming off my break!
Sorry!
Glad you think so.
It looked like you were talking to Minato as though he were in the flask...
Weren't you buying them for someone else?
What happened?
you'll never learn to ride the waves.
We need a fire extinguisher! Call the fire brigade!
Minato, don't go! Hinako.
I know I asked too much of you. I called out to you too many times.
Of course not. I just heard that you work here, is all.
It gets slowly released after the beans have been roasted.
When I finish high school, I'll go get trained at the main branch, in Chigasaki.
You never know when the two owners will pop their clogs.
You wanna see it, right? Yeah.
They all said he'd helped them, somehow.
so he said he wanted to become somebody who helped others.
Here it is.
You did good, kiddo.
Hinako? What about the strawberries?
Hey!
Nope, you'll never fill his boots.
Do you think you could ever be with me?
Why? Well, firemen are cool, aren't they?
You say that like it's an obvious reason. You're serious?
Thanks.
The sugar's there. Okay.
You can have the rest of the coffee, just bring the stuff back to the caf.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
I mustn't!
Really?
We goofed up last time, so this time we've got us a pro with fireworks.
You want me to applaud?
There's this great, run-down old building.
Boss, I'm punching out early, today.
It looks like these guys were the perpetrators.
Yoko, this is serious. We should call the police.
Looks pretty dead, though.
We're so high up!
We'll set 'em off from right here. Boom!
And another! Boom!
This is really bad! What? What's going on?
You're sure? I am!
A girl I love is in trouble!
We can't get a ladder up that building.
Shit! Put your face guard down!
We're looking for them!
We couldn't miss celebrating your lifeguarding certification, could we?
They caught them!
Sounds romantic to me.
Happy New Year!
I guess the waves are gone for today. Might as well bail.

JOBS HELPING OTHERS
Shun, you've got a petal on your head.
I just don't get it.
You don't need to give Kaname anything, Shun.
That's just who he is.
Taking on someone else's life is a heavy burden.
What?
You here to watch? No problem.
You can't run away now.
...that's missing from your high school experience!
But I didn't ask for it.
We play a lot of basketball in PE, too.
See?
The target!
Damn it. Why can't you make up your mind?
He can't make up his mind.
I don't know.
Well, he is an adult, you know.
In a middle school cooking class, Yuuki...
So fast!
I get it!
He wanted an indirect kiss.
The tea cup!
If you'd like, you can use this.
Um, here...
We couldn't wait.
I have some band-aids.
No, I'm fine.
Look who's talking. You guys used to...
I have just the spell for you.
It's just like magic. That's amazing.
Super unlucky?!
You'd have to be pretty stupid to let this childish prank get to you.
These aren't mine!
Speak of the devil...
And don't order me around.
My, my. What bad luck.
help her or worry about her.
What? Really?
I see. That's great.
"So itchy, so hot. They're on fire!"
Yu-Yuuta-kun, you're bleeding!
That's a lot!
Who are you mad at?
I just wanted to make sure.
I'm sorry!
Oh, you don't have to...
G-Give me another band-aid sometime.
You're still bitter about that?
Suddenly going back to our ordinary lives is boring.
Seriously?
What?
I won't be able to collect the stickers if we eat here every day.
Let's all help Yukki collect stickers!
I'll help.
You just grabbed a towel and came back,
Yes. Sorry, but we're about to eat lunch.
You start with something like an exchange diary!
I don't need to buy bread every day,
It's unusual for a high school boy to want a plate.
You're into this sort of thing?
I'm collecting stickers because I like them, too.
i1Guess not.
Kids these days...
No one screams about stickers in a store.
You're all eating cafeteria food,
and I have to eat convenience store bread.
What's wrong with them enjoying their meal?
You're too nice to them.
They're that loud because they're obviously not getting along.
I'm surprised you knew we'd be here.
someone you like?
I hope your uniform doesn't stain.
i1This better be worth at least three points.
i1Again...
So you got one point.
She's pretty, too.
Yeah.
Who cares if he does?
so he asked me to bring it to him at school.
It certainly seems that way to his brother.
I'd like to see my old school again.
But...
All right! I'm coming, too!
I wanna see the middle school you guys attended!
Okay! Let's go see Fuyuki-kun!
Who's the one with the weird hair?
Oh...
Nice to
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Why do you keep saying that in public?
Hey, wait.
Is that true? They feel like upper arms?
A crushing defeat.
Hey, Matsuoka-kun!
He's not listening.
More like scary, with the way he's knocking them down left and right so indifferently.
What are you doing here?
Whether asleep or awake,
You idiot! It's not that easy!
That's the only thing that's perfect.
I see.
Obata-sensei, is he one of your former students?
No, you don't!
Jeez! Why are we wearing our gear at a time like this?
Our microwave wasn't working recently.
He said hitting it would fix it, and now it's even more broken.
Yes. Fuyuki is kind sometimes.
When we were younger and I hurt myself,
How worthless!
What's that smell?
I'm just a guy who thinks more about raunchy things than recycling things.
I knew it! A bandage!
Before? He was always...
Oh come on! That means he hasn't changed a bit!
Next time: The Sunshine Song.
While we enjoy these quiet days,
I wonder if they have more playground stuff now.
I'm not pouting.
I'm the only one who attended a different kindergarten.
Your lip is sticking out even as you say that.
We're all going to Hidamari Kindergarten.
Many seasons have come and gone, and although much time has passed,
It's the middle of winter, too.
Listen up, you guys. You better not say a word about it.
I'm just going to look around!
Ow.
Chizuru-kun, are you all right?
I don't listen to evildoers!
My hair's stuck...
Thank you.
It's nice to meet you!
I was just getting to know her!
I'll be your wife!
I want to take things slow.
Everything about us matches because we're friends.
You have to do it properly. Come on.
Stop being so dramatic! We're only playing house!
Do you want to play, too?
Let go!
Ken-chan, you're awful!
This is stupid!
Bathroom, bathroom...
Wh-Who cares whose they are?
I didn't...
i1I'm sure he really is a good kid.
That's disgusting!
I'm a bully!
When will you come out?
Ken-chan?
H-H-How'd you know?
I'd be that cool guy's wife again.
I won't go near that brat again.
He was just as passionate about the girl he liked...
Really? Kanamecchi, were you really?
This is great!
I wonder how far and how long we'll travel together from that place.
What does that have to do with you?
Does she have a cold?
Do you think she went to the hospital?
There's been a lot of activity around us lately.
Nice to meet you, too.
Here.
Here.
Small world, huh?
Someone keeps making strange advances if I hang out over there.
Tsukahara Kaname. I'm in your class.
That name's clearly full of animosity!
First thing you do is piss me off.
It's a shame I didn't get a chance to talk to her.
You really don't remember me?
I'll keep reading until I understand it, too.
I think someone gave me something like that.
So small.
Um...
What are you doing?
Huh? Um, it's probably in my bag or my locker or...
I'll return him later.
Let's go!
What language is that?
You want to play together?
Wait!
It's fine.
i1What you doing? I'll leave you behind!
When I passed by the park,
I guess it did hurt, but I wouldn't have wanted you to apologize.
I wouldn't learn German just to apologize.
Yes?
Are you ok?!
Let's see... I'm in the tea club.
The floor is yours!
You're no fun.
that there are things more important than money.
And why are we having this mixer?
There was nothing amazing about it.
I've figured it out.
Kaname-kun, you reek of cheesiness.
You're not helping!
Are you okay by yourself?
Why don't we combine yours with mine and make a snowman?
I don't need your pity.
i1What? What is this?
i1Damn it.
What are you doing here?
Visit?
Kaname-kun, are you okay?
I'll force you to...
No, you have to rest. He doesn't say his name heregj cr
Hey, do these look good on me?
Your house sure is nice, Kanamecchi.
Why is she crying, anyway?
You can talk to me any time.
I haven't held your hand in years.
That never happened!
Oh, Hisa-chan!
Then, I'll...
I see. You're right.
Then you should shut up and rest like a sick person.
but I never get to help him.
The rainy days continue.
What? Yukki, are you doing volunteer work?
We can't let that happen.
You can't, either?
Let's see...
It'll be cool at night, and I'm pretty sure everyone would go if I invite them.
Hey!
She looks like a sheep.
Hey, what about you?
i1Is the plan that praise-worthy?
Don't worry, you'll have your fair chance...
Oh, um...
Wait!
Miss, you don't know what you're doing, do you?
It rips! That thing rips!
an8Stop it. Cut it out.
What?
I didn't hear the melody of love bubbling beneath the surface!
In fact, if we're just talking about his face, he's my type...
Do you want some?
They should sell fireworks at the supermarket.
Should we go, too?
I see. Thank you.
What?
Oh, you dropped something.
That's it.
You idiot!
If you get emotional, you won't be able to aim properly.
You're too calm about this!
Shut up.
Here we go!
I look forward to working with you.
It's hot out.
Ah, but, I don't want it all off...
It's best if you just disregard that.
I taught him subtraction when he was little,
You used to come with me.
You shouldn't make girls cry!
I know I can do it now!
Illness starts in the mind, and studying starts with glasses.
Wait, you already have a pair! I'm so stupid!
Squeezing it stimulates your brain.
Forget about that and study
Don't say that!
Oh, you're right.
Glasses?
Shun's not like that.
Or would we?
Why would I--
We're thumb wrestling.
Thumb wrestling?
Yuuta-kun, do you like drawing?
That's Yuuki.
That was embarrassing!
an8But they're both so good looking.
Do you want round glasses?
Coke-bottles?
What do you mean it's just your bangs? You two are completely different!
Watch it!
You'll have to put your glasses on to protect your eyes, it seems.
Okay, okay.
Apologize, first year.
Hey!
It's oil-based ink.
Hey, Yuuki...
It's his own fault that he doesn't have any manners.
No, it's fine.
I was going to, but you seemed so desperate.
Kaname-kun, are those...
Hey! What are you drawing?
I got my hair cut, but it didn't help with the heat as much as I expected.
I could feel the summer ending.
"Next time: Next to an Apple."
No.
Can't you even shut up for a little bit?
S-Sure.
Let's split up and meet up again down there, so Yuuta doesn't suspect anything.
Sorry. Were you waiting long?
An after-school date.
i1They must have nothing else to do.
From here? Probably...
If there's only one copy left, he'll go to another store.
Who did it?!
You like books?
I'll... lend you that CD sometime.
Love?
Where's your girlfriend?
Ah, Chizuru-kun, don't eat things off of the floor!
Did you just look at your phones the whole time?
What is it?
It's fine. It's not like the CD inside broke.
Yuuta-kun always knew.
I could barely keep up with them.
Sure.
Besides, there are times when I have fun being with them.
I think if you change a little,
Yeah.
That was quick. Why?
Remember that!
Okay, okay.
I'll buy you some juice to make up for it.
I'll go with you.
No, you're too heavy.
You want me to draw a manga?
I don't own a striped shirt or have an F in the middle of my name either.
A-Anyway, see what you can do.
That's why we'll draw in the relay format.
We don't have any teamwork to undermine.
You would.
That wouldn't be a comedy.
It's too taboo.
Enough!
Yeah, I'll carry all of your failures to a pathetically weak finish.
You'd have to "simplify" your costs to make such a low budget hero.
It took all the effort I had just to draw one character.
He's totally crushing them under there.
I'm done with the third page!
What?
Huh? Am I behind?
I mean Not in a bad way.
Nothing. Just got the feeling I got a peek at one of the pages of youth.
Oh, really?
You can't change the genre now!
But the friendship, hard work, and conflict...
We're not actually living that life, so it's completely unrelated!
It's okay! Use your imagination!
Kaname-kun, you really are the best at everything.
Come on, Shun, you can do it.
Forget about that panel. Keep reading!
I could never have drawn five pages by myself.
A-Anyway, see what you can do.
The cake is ours!
Together, we are...
Stop it!
You can do it.
Yuuki's not that kind of person.
Watch out!
But I still think he's greater than any hero.
I was up all night thinking it over.
H-Hey, don't ignore me!
and trouble.
What? You haven't gotten any yet?
Could you look at this?
That's not fair!
Damn it!
Sir, please entrust me with your life!
Azuma-sensei.
so do your best.
You two, as well.
You know, you're not in middle school any more.
Don't you feel like we're getting better at making copies...
because we're copying others?
Spot on.
How do we stop this thing?
We made eight wasteful, failed copies.
Kaname, aren't you coming?
Yuuki! Monkey! Where are you?
Um...
but I'm signed up to be a ghost.
I know they did it.
What? That's not what I'm doing!
I'm wearing a jersey under here!
Y-You pervert.
Blackout curtains?
That won't be easy.
Tsukahara, what happened with the curtains?
Yes.
Yuuki, is the Manga Society doing anything for the festival?
I already did it.
I might as well have him do it if I'm asking you.
I know what you mean.
The days leading up to the festival were like a storm.
Look at that!
Thanks!
Hey, come on! Everyone's got their eye on Hanako-chan today! i edited this alot to incorporate hte reference to gegege no kitaro
I can't stand the thought of someone using us to further their relationship!
Masaki-chan, are you okay?
I want to get out of this dark place.
So not cute.
Wait, what?
Really? Do you have some time after this?
Why?
Kaname will get mad at you.
I dunno.
Masaki's class is performing Cinderella this evening.
Of course I have.
I-It's nothing. Nothing at all.
Masaki-chan got mad at me the first time I met her, too.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah!
Okay, thanks.
He said, "They'll understand."
That's the power of the Student Council.
There he is!
We don't have time to discuss this!
This brings back memories. It still smells the same.
i1With all these people here, I won't be able to tell where...
Her s-stepmother and sisters must have bu-bull-bullied her a-
Hey, Mary? Where'd you go?
What's wrong with Bathroom Hanako-san going in the girl's bathroom?
Get out!
Did Shun-chan say that?
Unbelievable.
If I had the energy to go to the dance tonight, I'd go home.
i1my entire body feels conflicted...
With sleepy looks on our faces, we say "Good morning" to each other
I'm going to be staying with my mother's friends for about a week.
How rude.
What else?
That's a Japanese word!
Thank you.
H-Hello.
She's a shy girl.
...the bathroom.
Where is your daughter?
Nope.
i1Oh!
i1I got an idea!
Come here!
Come on!
Thank you.
Alice, I understand now.
Thank you.
Hello.
Soak all the way up to your shoulders.
Can I sleep next to you?
I bet Aya-chan would enjoy talking about this.
I'll send you pictures.
Hello!
Okay.
Shinobu, school!
So, anyway...
Sorry, I was reading a letter.
Let me see.
I wonder what it says.
It's curious.
You really did come.
But what are you doing here?
Her hair and eyes look just like a doll's.
Just kidding.
That hairpin is cute.
Where are you going to live while you're in Japan?
My mum kept your visit secret from me.
I've studied Japan a lot.
i1an English girl came to stay in our home.
I have a foreign style room.
an1I can make it through with a smile
an3Three Two One Go!
The wonderful things present in ordinary days
We were simply passing time in vain
That's hilarious!
i1She's the very image of Japanese womanly virtue.
Onee-chan, do you have work today?
Hooray!
Good morning.
Mornin'.
Are you sensitive about your height?
Is that really so depressing?
I'm kidding!
Hello, hello.
What's "Shino"?
Friends...
Oh, it's Sensei!
This character was applied as a phonetic symbol.
That sound effect evolved into the word "moe".
Why did she even bother going over?
She liked them enough to do a homestay, after all.
Shino, that outfit you wore yesterday looked really good on you.
It did?
No blonde hair!
I've never thought about what I want to do in the future.
i1Shino's amazing.
What?
You left out the important part!
I'm behind you all the way!
Really?
Very well.
It's been a few weeks since I arrived in Japan,
It's great I could come to Japan.
I like to eat strawberries plain!
I-I'd never put that!
Of course I'm erasing!
i1 I don't know how to respond...
Stop it, you stupid-head!
England?
I'll get it!
"The beginning... of spring..."
You seem to have made lots of friends.
i1Alice, how old will you be on your birthday this year?
I wonder what they think of me.
Good.
What is?
I've missed you too, Alice.
Very impressive, Alice-san.
Stop... Please stop...
Even if we fail, with you here
Through our days, so let's look for them together
Jump!
an1It is time to open them
Even if we fail, with you here
Your laughing voice
Even Youko tries to keep out the cold.
In elementary school, she wore shorts even in winter.
Speaking from experience, you can get used to the cold.
I'm so excited for Christmas!
It's almost Christmas.
i1...our expectations.
Yes!
It's like a wonderland.
Puns are difficult.
Will you explain them to me?
Lookie, lookie.
I'm used to seeing you in weird clothes.
They actually asked me if I could come home for Christmas.
Celebrating with your family sounds so English.
Spending a romantic Christmas with the person you love is so old-fashioned.
I can't even imagine it.
Yeah.
A dream?
Do you remember your first dream of the new year?
You were in mine.
I'm surprised no one caught you.
What's wrong, Alice?
Your uniform is different, too.
D-Did my dream come true?!
I can't believe I'd experience a language barrier here...
I like you!
i1You shouldn't step on the threshold.
i1Yes.
She fell asleep.
Good morning, Dad.
Harsh!
This is too much!
Red.
It's a beautiful golden colour!
Ready, and...
There are sparkling fragments scattered
Let's jump over them with a one-two! A smile is the best
The nameless flower blooming by the path is something amazing
Filled with a lot of love
My uniform I sent out for cleaning is sparkling.
Look at how brightly the world is shining.
Good mornin'!
Karen!
What should I do?
I'm going to lie down.
It's the distance between Japan...
I can't believe how difficult they're being.
the new school year is finally beginning.
I'm your homeroom teacher again!
You can ask me for anything!
Youko, what were you talking about?
You mean since it's straight?
I'm glad we're in the same class.
Really?
I'm finished.
Sunny days make me feel so energetic!
i1I just have to cross over to the next classroom.
Karen, you are going to be late if you don't hurry up.
The protagonist of this manga is so cool.
What happened to you?!
This is what they call middle school fantasies.
What's the point of the eyepatch?
I'm still in the middle of the first volume.
Miss, your shoulders are so stiff.
In order to ease the burden on your sloping shoulders,
It's like some kind of code.
You're so mean!
Fantasise about people you know.
A donkey?
I'll get to it.
Now, then...
Pirates?
My name is Captain Karen.
What is your treasure?
We're in the story?
Where am I?
I have always longed to see you again.
Karen...
My treasure...
Shino.
Shino, were the two princesses separated forever?
You're right.
Shinobu, Alice-chan.
Until we recognised
In that colour
England!
But Shino, you don't speak any English!
I speak a little.
"Cut-pan"! Katsupan?
I feel so English!
This is your room.
Is there anything else you'd like to know?
She looks like this doll.
Um, uh...
They're already getting along very well. this can be made more actual-English-y but it's not wrong...
Japanese girls are so scary!
Sounds like fun!
I know! While the Japanese girl's at my house, why don't you live with me and be my little sister? Did she just turn full cockney?
You're so clever, Poppy!
Alice!
I got you a souvenir from Japan.
First you do this, and then...
Good night.
Konnichiwa.
Can I sleep next to you?
I hope I can visit Japan someday...
Sure!
Okay...
Good morning!
"Dear Shinobu"...
This is the first letter you've gotten from her, isn't it?
Let me see.
See you later.
Good morning!
That's her!
But why did you come here?
Nice to meet you.
Huh?
That hairpin is really cute.
I wanted to make it a surprise.
You even sit like a Japanese. people do use Japanese to mean "Japanese person" but ...
I've mostly gotten used to life here.
I love Japan!
Hello.
That dog, too. ano inu
Aya is smart and really reliable.
Youko is bright and cheerful.
Morning.
I'm not that short!
Why?
But I've only grown three centimeters since I graduated elementary school...
In that case,
What? You're supposed to tell me I'm wrong!
From homeroom.
English!
Shino...
Alice so moe!
Huh? Something's off!
That's where it comes from.
You sure took your time!
The heck is that?
Bzzt!
an8Hiya! I'm happy to help you, sir.
Shino, do you like Europe?
I like England and France...
Huh?
I'm going to draw a picture!
We live on the planet Earth! do we capitalize Earth hereproper noun
But if I dyed it blonde, I could overcome my Japaneseness and become a mosaic! I, like Alice, have no idea what she's talking about
Thank you.
Sensei, look over here!
but I want to be a person who can be useful to others.
Basically this, right?
an8Everyone, I love you!
Or something?
Yes.
Oh, you're back.
Of course!
About what?
I've always dreamed of going to see you in England when I became an adult.
Look, contrails. there's no common word for this, is there?I like contrail
You got a hundred. I think I'd actually say "you got an a hundred"
I drew a sunflower for you!
My homeroom teacher, Ms. Karasuma, Miss?
Alice, have you ever thought about dying your hair?
I'm over it.
Is this your mom?
Alice's blonde-haired friend...
It was interesting. wow, other direction than omoshiroi-fun
Never!
S-Sorry.
The rain stopped.
she was wearing a parka with a union jack on it,
Blonde hair...
Shinobu.
Oh, like shinobi.
and also that her speech is a lot more foreigner-like and appealing,
Be more confident in yourself!
Yes!
I wanted to return the pencil you lent me back then.
See you tomorrow!
Oh, I see!
Sometimes they speak to each other in English!
It's like they're celebrities or something!
Shino, I'm not sure about that metaphor.
Youko-chan dragged you around the school anyway.
Oh, sorry! I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?
I understand!
Those too!
I ended up sleeping twelve hours! maybe eight years ago this could have been "I accidentally twelve whole hours!"
Oh, Shino.
The people in your class haven't warmed up to you yet.
Bye bye!
Sh-Shut up!
Geez! Stop talking!
S-See you next time.
You won't be able to say it correctly if you keep this up! regoashuofnwesure, we can write about bad habits, but with context from the rest of the episode this is fine
Seriously, "marning"?
Happy birthday to you...
You were just a middle school student until recently, so...
Don't bother, Alice.
You're so mean, Onee-chan. O
I'd have gotten you a present if you told me beforehand.
A present...
By the way, what does did she mean by "not a shred of youth"?
Not quite.
Okay.
I, myself, like looking at curves.
But...
Thank you so much!
It's a snow globe! or snowdome
My, my.
What grandeur!
Of course she will!
I'm the older sister!
Alice, need help?
I was just offering to let you stand on my shoulders.
I got you stamps from abroad.
Huh? What?
What's with this tempest?oh yeah?
You each have things I like about you!
I see now.
It looked like you two got into a big fight,
I've gotta go see Alice!
A letter?
Hmm, maybe it's the same kind of word as "springy".
Like? summoning from past life
Anyway, we'll know if we open it.
I must know. I must know. I must know. I must know. I must know!
Do it soon!
It shows I'm delicate!
A delicate girl wouldn't go sliding into a base in the first place.
Th-Thank you.
I thought it'd look like a love letter if I left it in her shoe locker.
She sounded healthy.
Bye!
Is your head alright?
Shino?
Shino and I have been friends since elementary school.
What did you have for breakfast yesterday?
They are!
I guess I'll help you.
I know! Ring this when something comes up.
Ayaya, you...
Alrighty!
Hey, could you teach me too?
Oh yeah, you've never met Isa-nee before.
I've seen pictures of her in magazines, but...
Thanks for having us!
Come on in.
can I have your autograph?
Why would I want that?
Whoa, awesome!
Huh?
Ready!
Alright.
I humbly implore you to convey our regards!
And then this dress!
Could this be...?
I haven't seen you like this since the entrance ceremony.
What?
I won.
What kind of stance is that?
Thank you!
You're a lifesaver!
Onee-chan was going to throw these away!
Others may see them as mere slips of paper,
Are you gonna be alright? Do you have a fever?
Forget about convenience stores already.
Like this one.
What are you drawing?
Do you understand, class?
She's still half retorts, though...
Even if younger siblings are cuter.
You call Isami "Isa-nee", don't you?
Yeah, I do.
You're like another little sister to me.
Yeah.
So they might talk to us if we stand around here. commas?
I thought you two went home already.
Maybe a kimono?
Shino.
Let's go to the beach!
Mountains!
Blue sky, white clouds!
We hopped on a plane one Saturday morning.what the fuck
Left my swimsuit at home.
You look just like a fairy!
She was supposed to come with her dad.
Are we almost there?
Papa brought it!
Back in England, some people were steaming after seeing how good I was. or something like "I made them say 'uncle'", because the joke is that she uses some weird phrase
Alice, you're burning me.
Karen, you're so cool!
My mom!
There was a mosquito!
Why you...
Shino!
What should I do?
They...
There's no way I could choose between them!
Take a look at this.
Don't dye your hair some weird color!
They walk around carrying a giant samurai float, right?
Hold this.
Huh?
Hey there. eh
How blasphemous.
Lanterns!
Torii! Education!
Making stuff up again...
Onii-chan!
They're good!
I'm fine.
I think you should take a look at yourself first.
What about you?
Yo!
One, two, and three! ctl-H this if you like it
Fireworks! Fireworks!
Yeah.
Why didn't you say anything?
Isa-nee, wanna join?
What did you buy? have you eyes, Alice?it's dark. also, they aren't round in England
I don't know if I'll be able to eat all that...
Shino,
Okay!
We can't.
You need to be in a wide open area for those.
"Tick. Tick."
"Tick. Tick."
Today, in music class,
Youko, you looked like you were having a blast, singing that loudly.
Oh, really? Thanks!
Were snow to fall today...
I'd love to hear you and Alice sing a duet.
Is something happening? ...
Yes, every year around this time.
Alice, what are you writing down?
You won't forget things if you write them down.
My tracksuit.
And you didn't tell her? huh?
Okay!
Stop!
Ow-ow-ow-ow!
We're not in a judo match! eh, somethng like that
They're even slower!
Yes?
N-No...
Ah, fluffy!
Fluffy-fluffy!
Am I using it right? or using instead of doingalthough I do like the double meme before
Y-You're kidding me!
Or you can walk while lifting your feet a little higher than usual.
Karen, that's rude!
I jog about ten kilometers a day.
I want to be like you, Onee-chan.
So she basically called you a capybara?
Open your eyes!
Alice, you got me all worried for nothing!
Whisper it to me.
an8Please, you must have it.
What could she be making?
Alice made my lunch today. Today's lunch was brought to you by Alice
Rice!
Why don't you think about something more fun?
Crap! I completely forgot about that!
Shino, you don't have the time to be doing that.
You don't know?
Shino, welcome back!
Good marning!
Start.
Her stare is boring a hole through me!
I can't let myself be distracted.
Same to you!
We still have more tomorrow, you know.
Shino, good work!
Thank you, Alice!
A school festival isn't like a summer festival.
The sweets shop!
I won't go easy on you! youjo?I know it's right
Why are you bringing that up now?
Both of us will get what we want then.
What about something like this?
I will!
Sounds good.
Go on!
What is it?
Inokuma-sa
Thank you!
Boiled azuki beans.
Huh? Karasu-chan?
You'll get fat if you snack in the middle of the day!
Does tofu even count as a snack?
Before I fall asleep!
Octi!
Back home, we have a party every year!
Sweet beans in cake.
Hey.
Oh!
There she is.
Isa-nee!
Oh, it's starting.
Alice,
Wow, what a cute ribbon!
Alice, you're always wearing that hairpin,
We're back!
What's that on your head?
It's so cute!
I see.
That new kind of instant ramen I ate last week was really good,
So you're going to be alone tonight?
We're going to meet Karen at her house and then go over to Aya's together.
Sorry for the wait.
She's not here yet.
Your hand is freezing.
Yay!
Me too! isn't she included in "we"I guess so?
Alice, Karen, are you done with the eggs?
How?!
You're so mean! You knew, didn't you?
If I had been by myself, I probably wouldn't've even been able to fall asleep!
You had some really bad bed hair.
Raw weed raw ride raw r raw wheat, raw rice, raw eggs
Ah, you don't see sailor uniforms in England much, do you? even though sailor fukus were inspired by British sailors, I think
You're pressing the limits quite a bit as is. ???close enough
That was fun! It felt like we were on a trip! ugh
an8I want to see your house!
Then try mimicking my speech pattern! this is where we wish we kept Karen's katakoto?
L-Like this?
How can you have an accent and be fluent at the same time? this would be easier if somehow we kept the stuttering meaning of katakoto...shot ourselves in the foot...
Aya!
Nope!
She does really well even when she doesn't know the rules.
Ayaya, this is your final mission today!
I want to buy a notebook, so can you come to the stationery store with me?
Wow, Youko!
I am Komichi Aya!
Let's play!
One...
Two...
there was one time when no one ever found me
I'm sleepy...
and Shino has the ability to erase her presence completely.
Sensei?
Not here either.
We haven't looked here yet.
Karasuma-sensei!
You're so cute, Alice!
Come catch me!
Jump!
an3Ooh, yay!
I'm an English teacher at a certain high school.
Don't run in the hallways, okay?
What's this?
G-Go ahead...
Like what?
Speaking of which,
Ka... Kare.
It sounds a lot like "curry".
Yes?
Karasuma-sensei?
it was a bit hard to say back there,
Good for you, Shino!
Don't tell me my bad luck rubbed off on Shino!
Here I go!
Hooray! Hooray! Alice!
Hooray... hooray...
Don't give up yet!
Run to first base!
Look, a foreign girl.
Shino, it looks like your luck's not very good this month.
Don't put too much faith in those horoscopes!
Your positivity can get you through anything!
Your lucky color is orange.
Do I even have any orange clothes?
Excuse me, Sensei.
Me too.
Who's that?
Don't take her so seriously!
Tell her, Isami!
Where am I?
I found a cat!
So we're not related by blood?
I'll treat you to cake!
She's easy to read.
S-Sister?
Shino! Alice!
Don't remind me!
There's a totem pole...
Here, here, kitty-cat!
Nothing.
Next episode, the long-awaited England battle arc will begin.
Maybe.
Yes!
We wanted to celebrate with everyone.
Huh? What?
Who needs coats anyway? punctuation?
Shino, do you like Christmas?
Yes, I like it a lot.
Shino...
Yes!
Sensei, are you going to be spending Christmas with your boyfriend?
Hold on, Shino!
"This flower is Karen."
Which part was the pun?
Say it again!
They sure went all out!
It's so pretty...
Karen's wearing one.
I'm really happy that I have the chance to experience a Japanese Christmas this year.
Love will come snowing down!
Be careful. on your way home
This "spending Christmas with the person you like" thing is so old-fashioned!
Huh?
A dream?
You appeared in mine.
Seriously?
This is way beyond what we learn in class!
Two.
Shino!
It's true that Alice looks really cute in those clothes,
Alice!
Um...
So "hello" is not enough to build a conversation?
Alice, you know everything, don't you?
Wait, what's with this narration?
even if you become a samurai,
Karen, you're already pretty Japanese.
Huh? Alice?
Good morning, Mom.
Big daughter you got there.
Red.
There's no Shino in this class.
What should I do?
Ayaya, you too!
I don't think we are.
You cheater! let's just do it
Did she want to be with Alice that much?
Let's have a good year together!
Yeah.
Karasuma-sensei's your homeroom teacher, right?
Class A's homeroom teacher is great.
We're just one classroom apart!
Good morning!
Get to university.
Okay.
Morning, Karen.
You got a stye or something?
She's a high school first-year, though.
That's so misleading!
I've been reading some classical literature recently. as a side note, I find it funny that there was even a debate about whether "Classics" meant "Greek and Roman literature" in English
It's like some sort of code. I can't actually hear what she's sayingmarude angou no you
Shino, you haven't read a single line yet!
The old woman headed to the river to wash her clothes.
What are you imagining?
Oh!
A donkey?
Really?
What is your treasure?
Ahoy, mateys! ...
That'd be too sad an ending.
...surely lies before you.
we might actually find it.
Shino!
"But before that...
It really draws you in...
Would Aya be a mermaid?
Youko can be a prince!
...the one who saved me when I was shipwrecked?
Give Shino back to me!
Karen!
Why?
Please, witch! capitalize these? also, Witch-oneechan
Hey, that was just a story.
Coming through!
Would everyone return to their own classrooms?
They can see each other whenever they want.
Huh? That story took place in the present?
"Gakkou"...
Coming!
Is that the thing where you stay in a foreigner's house?
How rude. I can speak a little.
Like, "hello."
"Guts pose!"
Where is your daughter?
Alice!
Shinobu, how is it?
Sounds fun!
I got an idea!
Then I am going for my trip tomorrow.
Karen's family seem to love traveling so much.
as long as we try to listen to each other's heart!
I'll go heat up some milk.
Here.
Turn.
Hyakunin isshu or Fukuwarai?
Soak all the way up to your shoulders.
This smells like Japan.
Thank you.
He
Shinobu.
Good morning.
Shino, you're late.
Sh-Shut up, Yoko!
Happy uniform?
Do you know a girl named Shinobu?
Thanks for waiting.
Yeah, I came to see you.
That's amazing. But what are you doing here?
Komichi Aya.
"Boar" and "bear" make "Inokuma"!
Alice!
My mom kept your visit secret from me.
Do you have a Goemon bath in your bathroom?
This is...
Even if I'm Small
Good morning.
It's been a few weeks since I arrived in Japan.
Anyway, then she...
She's a scatterbrain.
What? Yeah, I did...
Bow.
Alice Cartalet. I plan to enjoy
Alice, how old will you be on your birthday this year?
that'd make you around 50 centimeters.
But I've only grown about three centimeters since elementary school...
Hello, hello.
Miss Karasuma, your English sounds a little awkward.
Impressive, Alice-san.
What?
Oh, it's Sensei!
Moe!
This character was applied as a phonetic symbol.
Wrong. The correct answer is: A foreigner!
I'm getting all mixed up. I'll try to draw it.
I don't know if blonde would work...
The toughest thing about being a student
Just think about what kind of person you want to become.
Someone
What?
Shino, are you done?
I've known what I want to be since I was little.
Please don't continue before I've finished translating!
Aya, you seem like the type of person who'd write "Bride."
Alice is deep in thought.
She's so small, but she's living in a foreign country all by herself.
You seem to have made lots of friends.
Friends?
That was amazing when you raised your hand, Alice.
I vote for hamster.
Kitten
Alice's Position
That's great.
What is?
Homeroom teacher, Miss Karasuma.
She always treats me like a child.
Aya-chan!
Thank you for showing us your photos.
You're right.
Those boots...
Maybe you just started noticing them more since Alice arrived.
You're right...
I can't wait for lunchtime!
Your speech sounds a bit broken, for a half-Japanese.
I want to become fluent in Japanese, like Alice.
What a beautiful name.
Your name means you will grow up
Yoko, Shinobu, and... um...
please call me Shino.
Shino, are you a ninja? Can you walk up walls?
What's wrong, Alice? You're acting strange.
Is that true?
And I wanted to see Shino...
Promise?
See you...
See you tomorrow.
Japanese people just wave when they say goodbye! Jeez!
Me, too.
Hey, I discovered something really cool.
W-Well, the most important thing is...
Are you free today?
Maybe they don't want to talk to me because of my slanted eyes.
A club, huh? Alice, are you in a club?
I'm sure they'll all become my friends.
Huh?
Karen-chan, let's be friends.
Nice job.
Um, Karen-chan...
I wonder if I would have made friends with everyone right away, like Karen.
I can barely walk into fast food places by myself.
fad200,1Slurp
Yes, thank you.
What is this song?
She has a certain calmness about her.
Yoko, how could you say that?
No!
I'll get you the perfect present.
I'm not an old woman!
But my sister takes after my mother, and I take after my father.
Shino, you sit there.
But if you insist on giving me something, I'd take a strand of your hair.
Huh? She stole Alice from you?
She knows exactly how to handle her.
Little sister!
You've grown so much!
Oh, okay. You can go on ahead.
Aya, are you having trouble reaching?
My shoulders?
I've gotten so used to Japanese, my English is suffering.
Karen, you have all the answers right.
That's amazing!
Shino, we made the same mistakes.
I bought you foreign stamps.
What? Um...
Alice, I love you, too.
Oh, my.
Karen-chan.
Class is over. I need to go see Alice.
What's wrong with you? Do you have a fever?
Wow, is that a love letter?
You don't actually know if it's a love letter.
You must burn that letter immediately.
I've got a feminine side!
so I guess I should read it.
I'm happy to have received the letter,
Because no matter who wrote it,
What are you talking about?
I was just saying how great it is to have friends.
"How is England? The weather in Japan is nice."
It was a disappointment.
What?
She sounded better.
Now that I think about it, there's no way you'd receive a love letter.
Yoko and Shinobu seem like sisters sometimes.
A kiwi yogurt.
I wish I were a kiwi.
You were lost? You sure are hopeless, aren't you?
While she's at school,
That's not what that's for!
so just remember what I teach you and you'll be fine.
Yes, fo' sho'.
Hot...
In that case, why don't we have a study party?
Really? I don't look at fashion magazines much.
You only came to Japan recently, didn't you?
Excuse the intrusion.
Hey, Isa-nee.
If you don't mind, I was hoping to get your autograph.
Why?
I'll give you one of my most treasured possessions: a Venetian mask!
That's not true, silly!
In fact, there's barely any flavor.
It doesn't have much flavor.
Can't you be a bit more sensitive?!
You mean these clothes don't suit me?
but I like taking pictures even more.
Isa-nee, let's take one together.
Sure.
Have you gotten used to it?
Come on.
It looks nice.
How do I usually look?
Arm wrestle you?
Aw. I lost.
Yoko.
Are you taking those to your classroom? I'll help you.
Thank you. That helps a lot.
Shino, what's that mountain of paper?
Fliers for overseas trips.
but they're my treasure.
Do you see the difference?
Comedic Retorts!
Now that you mention it,
What is it, little sis?
Do you have any siblings, Sensei?
You don't need to hold my hand.
You're ruining my moment!
I know you view Shino as your little sister.
Yeah, guess I do.
It's...
That would just make me a wooden doll!
Alice.
Alice.
Shino.
Alice.
It's so hot.
You said it.
Yamanote Line game! Places we want to go in summer!
The beach!
Why do you have to be so difficult?
Sounds like fun!
What were we talking about?
Oh, fine. We'll go to the mountains, then.
Mount Fuji
Mount Fuji!
Did you forget anything?
I left my swimsuit at home.
Because forest girls are cuter.
Okay.
What is this?
We're not going to Mount Fuji, but we're still going climbing.
The mountains!
Hey, everyone.
You're right. It's really good.
You want to swim that badly?
It's your fault for wearing that outfit.
Shino told me that the fish I cooked for her tasted good.
Shino, you really like blonde hair, don't you?
A float? Like a root beer float?
That's an Aomori festival.
Oh, my!
You're lying again.
Onii-chan!
What?
Oh, well, that's...
Yeah!
Don't swing that around!
A watermelon!
I don't think I can eat all of that by myself.
Shino.
You already lit it?!
Evacuate!
Only the sound of the clock echoed through the room.
a1My very first time, mountains and a festival, me and Shinobu.
You don't have to force my name into each one...
Even if we fail, with you here
I'm not afraid of problems
an1I can make it through with a smile
In that colour
Filled with a lot of love
Alice...
I feel much better.
Is this your mother, Alice?
That's the first time anyone's said that to me.
Y-Yes.
If you ever meet her, I'm sure you two will become friends, Shino.
Those boots...
She was wearing a Union Jack jacket,
My name is Kujou Karen.
Zoom, zoom!
i1I know.
That's exactly what it is!
It's Aya.
Ayaya?
please call me Shino.
Oh yeah, like "shinobi".
Come on, Shino.
Walk up the wall!
What do you mean?
See you tomorrow.
See you...
A foreigner!
Have you already tried natto?
That's amazing!
i1S-Sure, if you like.
i1Nice to meet you.
i1Are you free today?
What are you doing, Karen?
I see.
Your smile is wonderful, Karen.
I hope so.
Let's go somewhere on the way home, then.
So it's basically just a fan club?
Go ahead.
Huh?
Nice job.
Karen's amazing, isn't she?
Okay, okay.
My...
That's amazing in its own way!
Shino, you smell nice, too!
There's some kind of dark aura...
I'm tone deaf!
Really? Thanks.
Why don't you record yourself and broadcast it across the nation?
The season has finally arrived.
Is something special happening?
Karasuma-sensei, you're making us feel kinda sad.
That's what it means.
I write down difficult Japanese words
Gather 'round, everyone.
Ow! Ow!
I give up! This isn't a stretching exercise!
1,000 meters?
Ah, Aya-chan.
O-One more, please?
I know.
I'll teach you an incantation to reduce your fatigue.
I hear athletic clubs saying it all the time, so it must be effective.
Let's see... What was it?
It's time for lunch, but I ate it earlier,
'Scuse me!
Sensei?
You mustn't push yourself too hard when you diet.
You should use that from now on.
About ten kilometers, I think.
The first important thing is to know your current weight.
You really shouldn't.
Also, just eating snacks all the time isn't healthy.
She wakes up at five every morning.
You're supposed to answer questions!
What's going to be on the test?
G'mo'ning!
It's all thanks to you, Alice.
Ahh!
but there's a limit to how much I can memorize.
English Test
Stare
As long as you remember what you studied,
If you behave yourself, I'll give you chocolate.
See you next time! Bye!
If you don't stand down...
How about we do this?
Heave-ho
It fits Alice's image of a festival, too. That's not a bad idea.
But you can expect big things from me.
I'll save you some good seats.
I couldn't possibly comment, Sensei.
What? What?
No matter how much you cut it, Kintaro still stares out at you.
What?
Where's the nearest store?
Probably the hardware store in Kitaguchi.
To buy materials.
I want hamburgers today.
Karasu-chan?
Ah. You found me.
We're back.
Besides that? Um...
You don't remember?
It's the day you spoke your first word!
Don't be rude. She's mad.
Alice!
That's the anniversary?
You're embarrassing me.
Um, so...
What about an Academy Award anniversary?
Red bean cake.
Karasuma-sensei, welcome.
I tried putting wasabi in one of them.
Who would do such a thing?!
I'm here.
Isami.
Th-That's what I originally intended...
A play.
Let's go check out the rest of the festival.
The play is Snow White.
Shi...
Shi...
I hope you like it.
Why? But it's so cute!
Japanese is amazing.
The new brand of instant noodles I had last week was delicious,
We're having a sleepover at Aya-chan's house.
Alice, are you ready?
It must be this apartment building.
What?
What do we season it with?
Can you break the eggs into here for me?
I'm glad.
Thanks for the wonderful food.
You flatter me.
My mother made us meat with potatoes for dinner.
Oh, it looks delicious.
Hooray! Fried eggs!
Sensei, are you any good at tongue twisters?
It was fun how it kinda felt like a field trip.
Karen... No, Master! Make me your apprentice!
What?!
That sounds fun!
No, more fluently.
Nope. Today, I am your master.
Why don't you join us, then?
Okay, I'll teach you the basics.
I'm always saying mean things to her.
Oh, my.
You're a tsundere, huh?
Huh? What do you mean by "mission"?
Go, Ayaya!
How about this one?
Th-Thanks!
I can do anything when it comes to academics!
It's Karen.
Oh, no!
Let's find Alice and Shino next.
She hides so silently,
it made me wonder if she was a ninja in a past life.
I bought it in England. I like it a lot...
Alice-san!
B-But...
Okay, let's play tag next.
Your class is next door.
Omiya-san, I can feel your enthusiasm, but...
Right!
Hey...
Do you get it? It's easy if you think of it this way.
Why?
Like what?
You want one now?
You know what? Forget it.
Thank you.
If there's anything you would like me to change, please tell me!
Simulation
Good.
A-Are you all right?
That's my Shino!
Sure, but I don't know the rules.
I want to be the batter.
There!
You can hit it. Don't worry.
Oh, I bet you'd look good in these frilly ones.
Don't take it that seriously!
Huh? She hung up.
She's so easy to read.
Oh, it's Yoko and Aya.
Good idea.
We're about to go eat some cake.
Uh, Karen, you should take a bath first.
It does.
What is it?
I hope they'll all grow up to be fine young ladies.
in the beginning and doesn't appear after that.
Good mo Yoko?!
Yoko's clothes! She's wearing clothes!
What's Christmas like in England?
Yes, very much so. I love spending it with everyone.
It could only be...
She surpassed...
Welcome.
Yoko-chan, look at me.
What? Shouldn't you have gone?
Later.
So did I.
What?
Shino, can we open them yet?
It's finally present time.
You seem down.
Your uniform is different, too.
Maybe she's testing how much your English has improved.
I'm sorry, Shino.
What's with this narration?
You did what?
you'll always be Alice.
Shino...
a6With an eternally grateful heart.
That's right. We're moving up a year!
She fell asleep.
Good morning, Mom.
Mother
Daughter 2
Hey, Sis... I achieved a perfect score on my most recent test.
Wow, that's amazing.
Not even national borders can separate us.
Ayaya. You too.
I'm fine!
You two seem more flippant than usual.
She really wanted to be in the same class as Omiya-san.
Alice-san!
You can ask me for anything!
It's like Niagara Falls...
The damage is even worse than I thought.
That was quick!
We only had the opening ceremony today, but it felt so long.
Well, you came all the way across the ocean.
Yeah, you're right.
Good morning, Alice-chan.
The weather is nice.
Sunny days make me feel so energetic!
Thanks for waiting!
Good morning, Karen.
I thought I might learn something.
Let's see.
My eyelids are starting to droop, too.
But I've never written a story before.
It's true. To prove it, there's a switch on her back.
Shino, you looked so serious, everyone believed you!
If I don't come up with a story,
What is your treasure, Alice?
Shino...
That's too much of a bad ending.
I found the ends of the world.
As long as I'm with you.
She was just on my mind a little.
What can we do?
The witch of the depths.
Shino. It was all thanks to you, Shino.
You did it for us.
You're right.
Wow!
So you're gonna stay at
Like, "Hello."
That's Jinglish!
Hello.
Alice!
Yay! Good boy, Poppy!
Hello.
so could you come with me?
I heard that tourists love them.
Wow, I've never seen these before!
I put in cherry blossom-scented bath salts."Bath Powder" may be more appropriate, but apparently that's something you use after a bath
don't take baths very often.WATLOL
Be sure to soak all the way up to your shoulders!
Good night.
I hope I will visit Japan... some day.
K-Konnichiwa!
Bye!Bye! etc would work

Good morning.
And then she was like...
Alice, you have to say "Good morning!"
Morning!
I'm 155 centimeters tall,5' 1"
Yeah, you shouldn't worry about that.she actually IS saying that even tho she's worried about her height, her breast size has nothing to do with that, so she shouldnt worry about the latter. no additional comments made or implied on the first issue, lol
There's a perfect example right here.
You like English class, Shinobu?
our homeroom teacher.
Sensei was happy too!no this is me not paying attention
Shino, what about your pencil case?
I'm sorry!I don't get the jokeya got me
Alice is so moe!yeah this shit would be WAY too hard to make into english so fuck you its staying moe
Moe!
Cool!
Shino and Alice aren't even here yet, though.
Shino's love for the West is reaching maniacal levels.
I'm thinking of dying my hair once I graduate!
Wait, what is this about?
You looked great in your dress yesterday, Shino!
Your hair is really pretty, Alice!

Thank you.
I mean, what age do I look like?
Huh?
Youko, how could you say that?
i1It's your birthday today, isn't it?
Hooray.
That's not quite it.
Maybe you could be a model, too.
But if you do a photo shoot, you have to wear a swimsuit.
Y-You pervert!
Shino...
I bought you a present.
Thank you.
It's fake.
Can I really have this?
We don't look the same age at all.
The older sister.
i1Did I trigger a "sit on her shoulders" flag?
I keep telling you, I'm the older sister.
Oh, s-sorry.
You're so smart, Alice.
You got 100 on our last test.
Alice, when are we going to give them to her?
Shino, do you like Karen more?
Look at that face!
T-That's not the problem.
Everyone is good in their own way.
i1I was jealous of them.
I love, love, love you too, Shino.
That's too many "loves"!

Really? I wanted to take the day off and look after her.
Not so loud!
Shut up.
You're so popular.
What?
Is there any other reason someone would write a letter?
I'm sorry.

I'd imagine you'd be more popular with girls than boys.

You're not the ladylike type.
I was just saying how great it is to have friends.

Nothing.
Oh, sure.

Look at that huge smile!

No!

It would be great if you could show them to your cameraman.

an8I've been friends with Youko-chan since elementary school...
Okay...
Sorry, I was reading this letter I got...
It's all written in English,
Shino, your shoes!
Okay!
Sorry I took so long.
Alice?
Cartlett-san, please introduce yourself to the class.
I transferred from a school in England.
Everyone,
Doesn't it sound strong and powerful?
Seriously? wtf
You can stay at my house!
Um, I was already going to...
Oh, I got you a souvenir.
How thoughtful.
The small puddles and the things you worry about today
Onee-chan!
Shino!
A yoghurt.
Really cool.
Oh, you brought Shinobu here?
i1She is pretty absent-minded.
And that's how we got to be what we are now.
Sure.
How did your last test go, Shino?
We're here to study.
How nice of you.
If you don't mind, I was hoping to get your autograph.
It must have been you.
It was my stomach that growled!
Let's eat.
You mean these clothes don't suit me?
But instead of taking them here,
i1It's time to show the results of my daily practising in front of the mirror!
Are you ready?
Hey now...
i1Shinobu was an absent-minded child,
i1But recently,
i1T-This is kind of like...
Thank you.
Hey...
I have a bit of a cold.
W-What if my fever rises?!
Drop the convenience store thing.
Just what am I?!
What are you writing?
After observing you today, I realised that this graph was incorrect.
Everyone's looking!
By the way, I made an Ayaya pie chart, too.
Shino accidentally called Youko "Onee-chan" the other day.
Youko does seem like an older sister.
I'm an only child, too.
That kinda makes me happy.
I just started feeling a little sad.
When the three of them are together,
Me, too.
Yeah, guess I do.
Youko-chan, you're like a little sister to me.
Onee-chan, how about this outfit?
I love Japan!
Oomiya Shinobu.
Hello.
Oh right!
In that case,
Youko...
I was just joking!
She looks so mature in her tracksuit!
It's my nickname.
Alice so moe!
I wonder who thought of it.
I did.
I see. Cosplay.
Huh?
But that face says she doesn't understand a word!
Um, I don't know about blonde...
Yes! We're going to match!
But if I dyed it blonde, I might overcome my Japaneseness and need a mosaic! I, like Alice, have no idea what she's talking about
Huh? What were we talking about again?
Alice, your blonde hair is really pretty.
Thank you.
But mine is even prettier.
That's not helpful at all.
is getting enough sleep... do we mumbo this jumbo?
Looks like you're still worrying about it.
Awesome! You'll definitely make it, Youko!
That was fast.
What should I do? I can see the stars in her eyes. eyes shining
...I proposed to you?
We have to protect her!
You've made a bunch of friends too.
Really?
I drew a sunflower for you!
It even has a flag!
Are those pictures from England?
Is this your mom?
there are pictures of me naked!
The rain stopped.
Huh? Karen?
Let's go see her later.
Karen, your Japanese got a lot better.
Yeah.
I still have long way to go. 
Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya!
Oh, like shinobi.
Really?
My house is this way!
It's like they're celebrities or something!
Why?
Hey, Alice! I found something really cool! I don't even know if that's what she's saying
Although there is octopus inside takoyaki,
Must be something cool.
You just transferred in, so that's normal.
You're only a half, but you've got the aura of a full foreigner. "going full foreigner" in Starcraft, incidentally, means "losing a game that you had a huge lead in"
it's like Karen's a lion trying to mingle with deer! shika?
I have to run!
Shino, I'm not sure about that metaphor.
Please let me show you around the school!
Aya-chan, what's wrong?
Um...
Wait...
Heian era?
but there's something special about you, Shino.
You're embarrassing me.
Karen, I'm sure you'll fit in with everyone in no time. does this even sound right?
Um, so it's basically a fan club?
Roger!
Me! I do!
but I'm a high schooler, just like you!
Karen-san, let's be friends!
Wow, she did it.
I'm not jealous!
If I had been bolder in middle school,
maybe I would've made friends with everyone immediately, like Karen.
And like a dresser!
I don't! I don't, right?
I got it started.
Morning, girls.
Alice.
I don't have anything to give you,
Happy birthday to you...
Shino!
Happy birthday to you...
Oh yeah, today's your birthday, isn't it?
That was... open to any suggestions
No way! For serious?
Why?
I bought you a present.
But my sister said so.
No, you're the younger one, Alice.
No, I'm the older one!
See? You're the younger sister.
Which one?
Um, the third one from the right. you mean left?
Shino, we got the same things wrong!
I'm sorry!
Alice is Alice.
We are forever best friends!
I like Shino, but I like Karen just as much!
Hey, can I look on with you? this was the preferred language in my high school, but you might want to change itcould?
Such beautiful blonde hair...
I'll go tell her after class ends.
I know! I'll write down a reminder!
Pickled seaweed?
I'll see you later.
I really wanted to stay home and take care of her.
Yeah, it definitely is!
Aya, you can't!
That letter was addressed to Youko,
I'll be sure to read it in secret later.
See you later!
Youko, you seem like you'd be more popular with the girls than with the boys!
When we were playing baseball in gym recently,
Why? You should play to your strengths.
Alright, got it! I'm going to try acting like Aya!
Th-Thank you.
Any time. Don't worry about it.
I don't act like that!
What are you two talking about?
I'm gonna read it now.
What the heck?
so I wrote a letter and asked Alice to translate it for me. never mind the fact that her parents speak Japanese
Oh?
It wasn't cold medicine.
So I was gaming with Kouta and Mitsuki last night...
Onee-chan!
Mom!
An easy target for kidnappers.
We're being followed!
I see.
An older sister face? or expression, aura, feel
Take a seat.
I solved the thingy!
I don't read fashion magazines myself.
My, my. How thoughtful of you.
In that case,
She's getting embarrassed!
I-I'm sorry! I didn't ask...
Shinobu's been a spacy girl ever since she was young.
Try this one on next!
We had something to ask Youko!
Youko?so racist...
You okay there, Karen?
Youko, you always show up when people need help the most!
I don't know what I'd do without you!
You always stand back with a smile,
Put a mask on, at least.
What does everyone think I am, anyway?
Let's see...
By the way, I made one for you too, Ayaya.
Really?
Question!
Shino, are you going to the staff room?
I don't need you to hold my hand everywhere I go, Youko!
And if she ended on a deserted island, she'd probably end up as strong as Tarzan.
You call Isami "Isa-nee", don't you?
Alice.
It's hot...
What?
Blue sky, white clouds!
Oh, that?
I wanna go to the mountains...
I wanna go to the mountains!
Left my swimsuit at home.
Shino, you're so cute!
That's what Onee-chan told me.
It looks amazing!
I wish you could be my you-know-what...
Now you've done it!
Why you...
Just a little, I guess.
They...
Or is it this golden Karen?
I just couldn't!
Karen, did you bring yours?
Hold this.
Oh my!
Making stuff up again...
Oh my. Hi there.
you're gonna find something you really want to eat,
Can I?
It's hot, so watch out.
Shay dat shooner!
Now then, let's get going again!
Too bad.
Youko!
Yo!
One, two, and three!
Bam!
You have fireworks?
How long has it hurt?
Next time, tell me right away.
I know!
Isa-nee!
thanks for taking me to the festival.
The beach!
I don't mind where we go, as long as it's cool.
I don't want to.
I went to a beach recently.
I don't know about that...
Fine, but try not to collapse.
You're cooling down the air.this line is mis-timed -mogu
I bet it'll feel like an accomplishment when we reach the top.
Let's do this.
We can do some stream fishing here!
Leave the fishing to me.
When I lived in England, I could really show 'em at fishing.
I made lunch for everyone.
What?
You're right.
I wish you were my you-know-what.
You're right.
You want to swim that badly?
i1Just for a little bit.
Shino, are you hurt?
Sorry, everyone.
It's your fault for wearing that outfit.
i1Shino told me that the fish I cooked for her tasted good.
Alice!
There are all kinds of hair colours there!
Don't dye your hair weird colours!
It's a hand-me-down, but there!
Everyone helps haul a float with a big samurai on it, right?
I see.
Alice, hold this.
That's unconventional.
You're lying again.
Did you get separated from your brother?
Chocolate bananas are dessert, too.
Go, go!
Bye-bye.
I'm done, too.
Hey, Karen!
Ayaya!
Fireworks!
They can't compare to skyrockets, though.
These are for you.
It was a ton of fun.
You already lit it?!
What am I supposed to do?
Only the sound of the clock echoed through the room.
I know I'm tone deaf!
I liked your singing, Aya.
The Ayaya!
How is any of that a compliment?
She had such a soothing voice.
No, me!
At last, the season has arrived.
I write down difficult Japanese words I hear at school so I don't forget them.
This is exactly the kind of situation Karasu-chan's jacket is for!
There you go!
Okay!
I'm not very flexible, so don't press so hard!
Sh-Shino...
Go on... without...
Oh, okay.
Ah, fluffy!
Fluffy-fluffy!
Fluffy-fluffy!
Of course you'd gain weight if you ate like that every day.
Remember that next time!
Then I'll start running with you, Youko!
What's the point of that?
I'll go first.
Oh, my weight hasn't changed.
You're going to have to wake up around when my mom does, right? Am I interpreting this scene correctly?yes
The character for "rice" is on the rice!
What about you, Ayaya?
Are you guys going to be okay for the test next week?
I'm getting there.
I can be an interpreter when I grow up, right?
Shino!
I'm sorry, Shino!
Youko, you don't look like you studied very much.
Start.
Concentrate!
That sound...
The best thing about tests is when they're over!
Shino, you rock!
It's the first time I've scored so high!
Huh?
I'll give you chocolate if you study here.
It's almost time for the school festival!
Ever since we went to the summer festival, I've been wanting to go to one again!
Hmm?
Which would you two prefer?
I hoped we wouldn't have to fight, but you leave me no choice.
If you don't back down...
Is this really that big a deal?
As for what my part is...
...that's a secret!
U-Um, Sensei...
I-I know!
There's someone much better at that than me!
What is it?
Inokuma-sa
Is this your first time seeing it?
Aya, where are you going?
Cooking chocolate.
Oh my.
Me too!
Um... uh...
That's pretty much the same thing!
Because I couldn't remember what anniversary it was,
Anniversary?
Hurry!
What about the day you make your debut as an actress?
Aya-chan, it looks great on you!
W-Welcome!
M-M-M-M-M-M... open to any ideas
Sensei, is something wrong?
I put wasabi in one of them.
Dango? Cake?
I'm not on the menu!
Huh?
Ah, here it is.
Isa-nee!
Already?
Shi...
The school festival ended before I could give it to her!
Is it trash?
Finally. Took you long enough
Nice topknot!
It's so cute!
It's a magic word that cheers you up in times of sadness!
But to be specific,
so I called it "Ramen Day".
Slurp slurp!
Alice, are you ready?
R-Really?
Um...
Oh yeah, I saw someone crack an egg on their forehead a while ago.
We have all sorts of floral scents.
Geez! ...
Delicious!
Your timing is terrible!
To each his own!
an8Come to my house sometime!
Something on your mind?
I just thought of an idea.
Karenno, Master!
What do I have to do to be like you?
Today, I'm Ayaya's master!
What are you doing in public?
How can you have an accent and be fluent at the same time? this would be easier if somehow we kept the stuttering meaning of katakoto...shot ourselves in the foot...
Guess not.
Ayaya, why did you want to be like me anyway?
Karen...
Ayaya?
How tsundere.
I know how you can make up with her!
Sorry for what I did this morning!
What did you do?
I thought you suddenly hated me for some reason.
Then let's buy matching notebooks to make up.
Youko.
you're acting the same as yesterday.
The whole school's fair game!
an8Five...
Looks like there's no one here.
Oh god, they're leaving...
We haven't looked here yet.
Come catch me!
Bye, Karen.
Squeeze.
Let's try a little harder next time. unless you wanted the previous one
I'm being watched.
Wa
Sensei, you dropped something.
Ooh, a picture of your boyfriend? anti-gay all the way
N-No.
That's so suspicious, Karasu-chan!
It's not suspicious at all!
Ka... Kare.
Like that.
No!
Don't put too much faith in those horoscopes.
Shino!
Let's play baseball!
I borrowed equipment from Papa!
There're some marks on it, but it'll have to do.
Knock what out?
How is that different from what Shino's doing?
Youko...
Karen, you don't seem like the bookish type.
I wonder about that.
Y-You think so?
Oh, is that so?
Now then, picking up from last time...
Wow, that's great.
Shino, wake up!
Alice, have you seen my glasses?
Isami! You don't even wear glasses! wait, does she?
If you saw Alice in a store, how much would you pay for her?
A hundred thousand yen?
A hundred thousand is cheap?
What's up? What's going on
Be nice to it, okay?
I forgot to ask her the most important thing.
Done with homework and studying.
Y-Youko?
She hung up.
What?
...And besides...
Oh, it's Youko and Aya!
Sounds good.
Sure is.
You're lying!
A Christmas party?
Youko's just an idiot.
Christmas in Japan is a little different, isn't it? because I wanted to avoid "Japanese Christmases"
I sent my letter months ago! oy
I knew it.
Call her out on her lie!
Lovely!
How English of you.
Have a good holiday, Mom. this is surprising British
Yeah.
There's no such rule, you know.
Shino.
Alice.
Wow, Isami! You're the best!
Was that it?
You look down.
You don't look very happy.
Good morning.
You're looking more British than normal today.
D-Don't tell me...
That's right. no, that's not right, wtf
Ah, she's just playing with us.
The breeze brings the spring to my hometown in the Cotswolds.
Even though she loves Japan so much, she looked so lifeless on New Year's Day...
Alice!
yet sticky taste from other dishes.
Basically, it's all your fault.
It's not very nice to cheat.
Um...
I like you!
Having that as my first dream of the year is the worst omen ever.
It wards away bad omens.
Karen, you shouldn't run like that.
Morning...
Alice, can it wait until later?
One, two!
It's pretty, pretty fun!
And having big dreams
In that colour
Stupid music, stupid music, stupid music...
Youko, you seemed to be having fun, singing so loudly.
Everyone was smiling while you sang, Alice.
Now, I'll...
i1Searching for the sigh of spring and letters of the wind,
i1With the dignity of the cherry blossoms...
That's what it means.
Aya, what do you have in your bag?
What?
That's it!
Don't push so hard.
C-Come to think of it, where are Shino and Alice?
No, I can't run any faster than this.
She's trying to tell us something in English.
Oh, "fluffy".
What if you don't know the answer?
What are you normally doing?
You mustn't push yourself too hard when you diet.
That's because I go running nearly every day.
That's pointless!
Really?
Restraint embodies the Japanese spirit.
You should learn from the Japanese.
I'd like to eat a packed lunch made by you, too.
i1I know!
Appetites.
Are you going to be all right?
Is something wrong?
Shino's suddenly feeling inspired to study!
G'mo'ning!
Shino, good work.
Shino, how did you... do...
The world is shining so brightly!
I'm so excited for all the new things the school year will bring!
Even national borders can't separate us!
Karen!
Shino!
Maybe you should go to the nurse's office.
Shino!
Yes.
I'm your homeroom teacher again, so rely on me as much as you want! I'll lend you a shoulder anytime!
Later.
Youko,
Unlike mine, your hair is all ruffled like a dog's.
Sorry for making you worry.
If we were together, there'd be two blonde girls in the same class.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Fine.
I thought I'd learn a lot from them.
Like this.
Yeah, that's the spot...
I never said I was modeling her after you!
Oh, that's Momotarou!
You're making it too complicated.
There's a switch on Alice's back to prove it.
Once upon a time, there were two blonde princesses.
There. I'm done.
Shino!
the seven seas of the world!
Shino.
Yeah, that really fits!
Sure.
However,
What is most...
...important to me?
Do you have a blade?
Everyone's waiting for us.
an3Three Two One Jump!
The bright morning sun shines on the beginning of a new day
With sleepy looks on our faces, we say "Good morning" to each other
Jump!
We met here and now
What?
Are you going to be in the play?
Uh, u-um, Sensei...
You can go now.
Probably the hardware store in Kitaguchi.
i1She's even buying soy sauce.
Inokuma-san and Oomiya-san said...
No.
That's no different!
Anniversary?
I've got it!
Yup.
i1Every year?
So, anyway...
Why don't you make your acting debut an anniversary?
Get ready, girls!
Sensei, is something wrong?
What's wrong with this?
i1I tried putting wasabi in one of them.
a red bean cake, and chocolate dangos.
You look cute in traditional Japanese clothes, Alice.
Huh?
Take pictures of me with your camera.
Thank you.
Are you enjoying the school festival?
I wonder what role Karen is playing.
Snow White...
Is this a display ribbon?
But it's so cute!
"Donmai".
Through our days, so let's look for them together
an1It is time to open them
Even if we fail, with you here
We were simply passing time in vain
Please gimme your voice! The fact that
Just for you, my love
Yeah, so... anyway...
It's got really cold lately.
What?
How did you know?!
We'll help you.
Doing it by eye works fine for this stuff.
I want a bubble bath.
Bubbles?
I'll just borrow a little.
Thanks for the wonderful food.
You flatter me.
So scary.
You want to join us in telling scary stories after all?
What...
Is she a foreigner?
I wish someone would teach me the trick to saying tongue twisters!
I wish I could be as open and free as you.
Yes.
Oh my god!
You're doing well.
Nope.
No, she seems to be avoiding me today.
I'm sure it's just your imagination.
Let's go hang out with the Archery Club next.
They let me play the other day.
What?!
Ayaya?!
I'm always saying mean things to her.
Maybe I'll buy a new notebook, too.
Really?
I don't hate you!
Ayaya still has a long way to go.
I can do anything when it comes to academics!
You can hide anywhere in the school.
Rock, paper, scissors!
One, two, three...
i1There are so many places to hide in the school.
Marco!another localization that i cannot stand except this time i have no better way of doing it. The Japanese term for the person who is "it" is "oni", which is a kind of demon from folklore, and what Karen says here is a classic line people acting as the folklore oni use to scare kids: "Are there any naughty children here?"  "Have any of you kids been naughty?", to which Youko responds that Karen is being the wrong kind of oni.-mogu
i1Did Youko find her already?
She turned herself in?!
Karen, can I touch your handkerchief?
We haven't looked in here yet.
Um, I...
i1I'm supposed to be helping her hide, but they found me.
Alice-san, save yourself!
I get it!
Everything is pretty, pretty good
Let's jump over them with a one-two! A smile is the best
Okay.
i1I won't let this get me down!
What?
Sure.
I like her, too.
i1Why's she making that face?!
i1She's watching us.
How about "Curry"?
Like, "Hey, Curry, want some curry?"
You had something stuck to your skirt.
i1Stare...
i1She's watching us again.
You're just so cute, I ended up giving my rabbit the same... name...
She looks exactly like she does now, though.
...was taken during the cosplay contest at the end-of-year party!
Shino!
They're so cute!
i1Shino's so positive.
Oops, we got the wrong person?
We're sorry.
Is that an autographed ball?!
And with that...
Hit what?!
Go! Go, Alice!
Here we go.
I don't think I can hit it.
Shino.
Karen, I didn't know you liked books so much.
I wonder what she's reading.
I bet these clothes would look good on you.
Are you looking at the horoscopes?
i1Shino gets up late on weekends.
You two look exactly the same when you first wake up.
Isami, you don't wear glasses!
You're right.
It's a cat.
Meow.
Yes, this is Shino.
I forgot to ask her the most important question.
I'm so bored.
This is Inokuma.
What?
What?!
Give me a minute.
i1Cake...
Are you two shopping, too?
How did you get so dirty?
We have some shopping to do.
Oh, that's right.
Don't remind us of unpleasant stuff!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
...Mitsuki's...
Well...
I don't know about that.
O-Okay.
She's so cute!
G-Good morning. let's just go the whole nine yards
Sh-Shino...
Ayaya needs to get in better shape.
Shino, are you tired?
But Youko overslept today too.
Sorry, scrap that plan then.
I'd do anything for you, Shino!
I'm really looking forward to the school festival!
Why?
Really?
She's enjoyed this kind of stuff since elementary school.
an8I'll leave this to you.
Thank you very much!
i1It's possible that Shino doesn't consider me...
i1But...
Oh, Karen!
You'll get in our way if you read manga there. our way
Beautiful...
What's up, Aya? Do you want to play the princess after all?
How is it?
I heard Alice was really excited about it.
She left.
Very suspicious!
Let's follow her!
That, and she's too easy to read!too easy
Fidget fidget!
I just got a little sentimental reminiscing about our middle school days.
And she passed just like everyone else!
Huh?
Yes, ma'am.
That's not what I...
Shino, what kind of high school do you want to go to?
If you're at the same school, she can help you get ready in the morning!
Is something wrong?
I think I've seen it around.
Bye-bye, Sensei!do you feel weeb today
I sure am.
It's just not realistic.
Lots of students here made last-minute surges to get in.
I really liked this school, so I decided I wanted to be a teacher here.
Fight!
Oh yeah, Aya...
I mean, my parents and teachers did say I should go there.
Aya-chan's helping us study, after all.
Ouch.
Thanks for helping us out!
Done already?
Once I'm through with you, your hair could very well have turned gray! urge to implement a fully realized perfect future tense rising
Aya-chan, you're going to be at a faraway school in the spring. how can they wear such short skirts in winter
Hey, Shino.
What are you doing here?
But we should probably look it up.
It's there!
We did it! We did it, Aya!
We'll send you letters with express mail!
Okay then.
Have a nice day.
And you feel like a real older sister suddenly, Youko-chan!
Shino! Youko!
Aya-chan!
I ended up coming here.
Besides, I don't know what you two'd do without me!
Aya-chan, this play would've been even better with you in an acting role! watch me skirt around the tricky if-conditional issue present here
I'm sorry! I can't do it after all!
Apologies.
i1I want to help make it a success!
Do your best!
We're cheering for you!
She's good?
That's a cosplay from the anime Nin-Nin Kunoichi Ooichi!
Nin-nin!
We're the totem pole fairies!
There are lots of people hiding all around you.
Wh-What's going on?
We got yelled at.
Wait, Poppy.
i1This is my first season after returning to England.
i1I decided to study Japanese and stay at Shino's house.
i1Shino who likes blonde hair and foreign things.
What did you say, Yoko?!
The reason why in Nara Park there are deer,
Ashura-sama is a bit like Aya, huh.
Here, I'll give you the amulet I just bought.
Karen-chan, there's the Great Buddha of Nara!
The Great Buddha is in charge of protecting the peace of Nara
i1an8Beautiful.
 an8 This is Meoto Daikokusha.
i1Pretty.
Eh?
How do you know, anyway?!
A-Anu, Karen-chan!
After after After ....
I'm glad we chose Kyoto for the free schedule!
You must study!
Got a lot of photos?
W-What do you mean blonde is a waste?!
I will secretly take a photo together between the two of them!
Even spoken out loud!
Honoka, come back here.
I-Me too.
This Days Inn looks good too, huh.
i1Hei, Alice, let's go to the hotspring!
In English it means hot tub.
The open-air bath is indeed fresh.
Originally, I wanted to bathe with the monkeys.
What efficacy does this hot tub have, huh?
Do you feel anything after bathing?
Very good.
Correct!
The field trip is definitely a pillow fight!
No way, even though I've mastered English for the sake of this moment.
Ma'am who?
Of course, do I look displeased?
Usually my lifestyle and eating are westernized.
If you use it, it's like this!
Mature? I'm pleased to hear it.
If you get sick, your efforts will be in vain.
i1So...
I'm not happy at all.
Uh? But we registered through the regular route, so no interviews, right?
I'm such a selfish child!
My name is Inokuma Yoko.
Anu ....
Etto, I've seen the brochure and I think it's good.
You have a friend named Komichi Aya, huh?
Do you actually feel uncomfortable being taught by him or hate him?
Can.
It's cute.
I can master Alice all to myself for a whole day!
an8Really?
5 years too soon.
Left to sleep!
Although I continue to be the victim, anyway.
If according to Mother, Alice and Mama are different.
Oh yes, he even had a romance with Mom.
B-Right.
I want to join.
Of course.
His words did not reflect his youth.
Alice!
What should I do?
Uh? You look less cheerful today, don't you?
His behavior did look strange.
Alice is in love.
So ....
We didn't know he was that small!
Hey!
i1This morning, Alice seemed to want to tell me something.
Aku Shinobu.
What?
I've been thinking about it for a long time, but it's hard for me to tell you.
Don't worry, I love British food.
Karen.
How do you know?!
Whenever you wanted to go back to England, I would always say I would come.
If I miss Alice, I just have to go see her.
Maybe we'll be the loneliest.
Well, I thought things would go their own way.
He's tired, isn't he?
Disrespectful.
What did you say?!
S-I'm sorry!
I do.
In the end I only used 10 thousand yen.
More than enough!
Put away your shame to drive away evil thoughts!
Can.
Great too, yes.
Very good.
It can be terrible if they catch a cold or get sick!
Mrs. Kuzehashi also came hatsumode?
Lies, right?
What are you looking at, Mitsuki?
Then, why are you doing the anxiety dance?
Rather than that, I want to talk about graduation holidays.
What happened?
We also want to do something for you.
Why are you guys doing such a pointless thing?!
Really?
Thank you!
Aya's hair clip from middle school!
I'll also wear a ribbon from Karen-chan and do my best.
Karen-chan the Goddess of Mercy!
But the fact is, the good news doesn't always come.
Only God knows our destiny.
How about this?!
Say something!
Alice!
Since we're going to fight hard, so we've come to ask for strength from Alice!
We're not nervous anymore after seeing you two.
Yes, I feel like everything will be fine if you say so.
We still don't know!
I can't stop shaking.
We're ready to hear it.
Now, Ayaya will not be a slave of the devil, yes.
Are you not accepted?
I was too happy to hear that Karen was accepted.
It seems that my body is used to British time.
I've been in Japan for three years, it's a long time, but I don't feel it, huh.
Am I already as tall as Mount Fuji?
Looks very plain.
Honoka, the line is long, here!
Why are you smiling, Shino?
I remember many things.
First day meeting you.
You really are.
I'll also imitate you to graduate with a smile!
Kujou-san?!
I also want to get it from Mrs. Kuzehashi who I always bother with.
But now it feels close...
Congratulations!
Right.
please help in the future.
Alice!
Are you two healthy?
We're still the same, right?
Campuses in Japan have started to enter college.
Of course.

I was always in the same class, with you.
I know it for sure! I'm going to die!
It resembles a tied up bundle, made of cord.
But, doctor...
Hmm, It may be something serious!
Even so. Hajime-chan, now I can travel with my mind at ease.
 Instead, I could have worked part-time!
Don't over think It! It's totally decided!
Oh... You'll drink something, right? All right, today's my treat!
Oh, I'll go now!

Yes. By the way, since when is Yuri-san,
That is The Glory Hostel, on the Shiranui island.
You'll be starting to work from today, immediately.
But before that, I'll introduce you guy to the other employees.
It's because, Kindaichi is a rare name.
But sensei, aren't you a doctor? Why are you working as a prep school teacher?
Take a look! This room here on the 2.nd floor, is the place the students attend lessons and reside.
Heh!?
Tuberculosis patients needing recuperation, have to go to the hospital for medical treatment.
Finally, I get to work together with a girl and

What, then! The Ashibi room.
Hahaha. Well. then how about a quiz from me now.
Because It's bad luck, right? Congrats!
Huh, bad things? No way, what things will happen?
Yeah. It's just a trifling tradition.
Please forgive me, Kato-kun...
If you're just a worker, then mind your own business!
Even ourselves, the students, are prohibited, from using the telephone!
By the way!? Who are you?
What's with that!? They're all very unusual, aren't they?
And the one with the most arrogant looking eyes is,
Above all, Morimura is the son of the surgeon Otemon, who's the head of the hospital board.

Well, while that may be true, making this into a prep school dorm,
But, only as long no one is allowed use that room, I think! The Scape Myrtle room, that is!

Hi! How's it goin'?
What're you doing, Kindaichi?
I'm sorry for that scare, master.
H-He knows!?
What's with this guy?
Then he tried to cook it and feed it to the detective.
Are you alright, master?
Sorry for the wait.
Very funny.
Incredible!
Hey, does he have no taste buds?
How could he drink that without dying?
And he's the one in charge of homicide!
Looks like my day off's over.
The coffee was so good, we should grab lunch.
Yes...?
T-The t-toilet is...
Hello, is anyone here?
They're ordering more...
I'm requesting.
See?
What the?
What?
The master, rather mama-san, is quite short.
You know, I thought something was off.
I'm certain they're reversed. Miyuki told me.
A real restaurant master wouldn't make such a basic mistake.
There can only be one explanation.
Then inside the fridge...
Hello? This is inspector--
By the way, when'd you start suspecting that guy?
Is there any reason?
Isn't that kinda gross?
With this hint, I knew there was a case here.
And, the reason why he had to hang up the calendar.
how to put it...
That reminds me! There's a nearby shop that's known for it's really delicious coffee!
You stop there?
Why?
They're looking for something.
to cooperate with Kindaichi-kun for the investigation here at Sunlight Mansion.
With Kindaichi?!
At this rate, the truth will be buried in darkness.
It feels like something's strange though...
She always checked to make sure there wasn't any of it in her food.
I don't know much about Kujiragi-kun.
Moroi Ren Prep School Student Humanities
Kaidou Hitomi Prep School Student Science
Enami Yurika Prep School Student Humanities
None of them?
but you made major renovations, correct?
Yeah. The Moonlight Mansion schedule and layout of the place.
This inexplicable layout. And...
Miyuki...
It's beautiful when lit up at night.
Specifically, they drove a student to his death.
I don't see what you're getting at.
How can hers have been poisoned when no one knew which one she'd take?!
It's impossible to commit murder at Sunlight and then return to Moonlight in ten minutes!
Out of the question. Getting here may be easy,
Hey, Miyuki. Compared to Moonlight Mansion,
On the first night, you had the Moonlight Mansion students gather
was so you could bring the science group students to Sunlight Mansion.
B-But Kindaichi, if everyone was in Sunlight Mansion, we would've run into each other!
Nope. Look at the layouts for both places.
the locked recreation room was used as a wall
Our science group only used the 2nd floor's west wing.
That's the true reason for the theme murders!
From Sunlight Mansion.
A certain case happened three years ago.
And the people involved with the victim were left with helpless frustration.
Kenmochi Isamu
Police Hospital
Old man!
I knew you'd catch on, Akechi-san.
Oof...
If that's the case, he did have time to drug it.
If you're callin' me the killer, you better justify it!
I see. "Guys" is strange.
Miyuki...
After that, it was just a matter of waiting for Uozaki to drown.
You made the call right in front of us and we bought it.
You still intend to bluff it out?
You said you gave it to Kenmochi.
What letter?
I... I...
Togami!
When I left empty-handed,
Togami tried to escape out the window...
Let alone the fact that she obviously fell because of you!
In other words, if we get caught, you'll be complicit.
As accomplices, let's put our heads together.
Why didn't you go to your apartment earlier?!
I think you can read between the lines.
You've been betrayed.
Make it happen.
After all, his two saving graces are brute strength and a strong sense of justice.
she left this message because she was worried about you.
Thank you... Thank you!
Kenmochi-sensei, thank you!
After all, it's my job to catch the bad guys.
Tonight you're going to enjoy a game of escape with your lives at stake.
Cafe Owl
Is the bus stop to go home over there?
Oh, no! I lost my wallet!
What should I do?!
But it takes an hour to get to the train station.
Rain! Let's run!
Please let us on! Please!
We're saved!
No, we were on the bus in the middle of a storm.
Were we all passengers on that bus?
W-What?!
If two or more people exit the room at once...
Hajime-chan always sleeps in class, so he can't answer it!
A mountain where parrots squawk? What's that?!
Hajime-chan, I can't leave you behind!
Well, you three are the last.
Look straight ahead and listen to me.
"How is this girl crying?"
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
I'm Kikukawa Kozue. I work at a hostess bar.
I know, Mugi-mama. But why don't you introduce yourself?
Why don't you intro yourself too, kid?
The rest of you hurry up, too!
Crap!
Hot!
I swear I'll unmask the Game Master!
The Game Master began a game of death.
Go!
Um, key...
You mean if we don't eat, we won't make it out of here alive?
Let's do what he says. Here.
Mugibayashi Mika
No choice.
However, beware of poison.
I-I bet the poison's in mine.
I see!
It looks like they're fine.
If you don't eat, he might kill you!
It looks like the members here were randomly chosen from the shuttle bus passengers
How long is this damn game of death gonna last?
You cried because your gambling debt's so huge, you can't even file bankruptcy!
This Way
A key is hidden somewhere in this room.
Only the person who finds it will be saved.
It'll be game over for everyone else. You'll die in this room.
I see! Follow the rules of etiquette... This is what he meant!
Ikuma!
That's got poison needles all over it.
Wait. Don't you smell something?
And he killed two people! But he won't get away with this!
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
The Game Master said he'd kill all of us,
My meeting ran long and I got stuck riding the last bus.
At work, I make games about murderers,
and Mugi-mama, the sweet owner, invited me to go to the amusement park with her.
I tell ya, nobody's got worse luck than me.
Yeah, although my debt's nothin' compared to Kozue's.
I don't even know his name.
I suspect one of them.
With both mother and son dead, her huge inheritance comes into play,
Wasn't that just by chance?
Hajime-chan!
Oh, yeah! That's right!
It's all clear to me now.
along with six other passengers,
Shimomura Shiho
Kikukawa Kozue
Sugimoto Jun
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
I don't know about that.
Shimomura Shiho was a major shareholder in that amusement park.
Yeah. That driver was the Game Master.
But Shouzou died soon after Ikuma was born.
So if Shiho and Ikuma died, where would that fortune go?
Who are you?!
K-Knockout gas?
Ikuma was supposed to die from the dissolved poison, but...
You can have mine. It's been safety tested.
Takaragi-san wrote on his blog that he hates alcohol.
Maybe the eye of that mask is blocked so she can't see the question.
What do you mean?

That artificially creates the parallax,

telling her to help the last person in the room.
I don't believe it!
Despite my appearance now, when I was young,
My life is like a puzzle ring that you just can't set free.
Sorry! I'll never attract customers by being this gloomy!
That's right! If I could arrange for Kozue to inherit that huge fortune,
I'll call for an ambulance.
That's right! There's no way I can use money gained that way.
I thought that for the longest time.
But they were so close to each other that they just couldn't say it.
but a girl is taken to the hospital after an accident at the diving pool.
Anyway, this is like a real-ass pool, huh?
Ushio Miharu
Another one is Nijieda Mitsuyo-san, who's going to dive now.
And the third person who can dive from there is Mizuki Runa-san.
That's right. The idea is for him to learn how to swim this summer.
Miharu's parents own the small rice shop over there.
and in exchange, she gets free tuition here.
Huh. It's like, where did their friendship go?
Maybe it's the curse of the Evil Spirit of the Diving Pool.
Fudou Swimming School
Great job from the first diver and rice seller, Miharu-chan!
It looks like Mitsuyo's jump was off and she hit the water hard!
Even supposing that's what happened, Miyuki didn't do anything wrong!
Don't worry, Miyuki. If my hunch is right, that might not have been an accident.
Hajime-chan...
A kind of lake that even I couldn't drown in.
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
There!
Yeah. So I put my nose to the grindstone and did some calculations.
Because of that, when something hits the surface of the water,
More than twice as great?!
You used strong gut to fasten the four corners.
Afterwards, you knew it'd be all over for you if someone found the plastic bag,
It was your swimsuit that did it!
I'm sure they'll find salt in the remaining pool water, too.
Only an awful person would rip my swimsuit in public and then show how rich she is!
You know, Sensei, if the two of us get even better and are both chosen for the Olympics,
I bet she'll get better, the two of them'll make up, and they'll aim for a medal together.
Cafe Owl
Still, after the commotion died down, the crew came out to check on the passengers.
Kindaichi-kun...
Do you know who did it?!
Besides, if you're going to reveal who murdered Captain Shida,
I definitely want to be here.
The captain was strangled at the controls in the locked cockpit, right?
that would only be the actress, Ishida-san, and the cameraman, Ohgoshi-san.
Hey, what are you saying about one of your passengers?!
was running around in the commotion.
The captain was murdered during the disturbance.
If it was really him.
We only thought the man who came out was the captain
Even with no one at the controls, if the plane is stabilized,
put on a captain's uniform themselves, and went into the cabin to create an alibi.
Y-You're bluffing!
I realized the same thing for one more person.
Kagaya-senpai...?
W-What?! Why me?! On what grounds?!
The smell.
She's a cabin attendant, right?
It wasn't me!
You're my fiancee, aren't you?!
But...
You... You...!
Wow...
Koganei-san...
a6Please turn off your cell phones and all electronic devices.
You surprised me before. I'm impressed.
That was all reflexes.
We're landing in 30 seconds. Brace for impact.
JAM Air 377, stop on the runway.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Oh, this?
I just did what was to be expected. You don't need to thank me for it.
Hajime-chan, that's no attitude to take after being saved.
A man's jealousy is just pathetic!
What what?!
Hey, I'm leaving.
A dreadful trick was hidden in the framework of the Gokumon Prep School serial killings.
I swear I'll blow the lid off of the Puppeteer from Hell's perfect crime!
Another murderer?
Yeah. The one who was in Sunlight Mansion.
At one point, the second "Sparrow", who was with the humanities group on the third floor,
secretly came down to the first floor hallway.
Then what about this?
Konoe was just about to die, so he didn't have time to think of a code.
HAMA
You didn't notice, even though he kicked and pounded on your door like that?
The truth is, you didn't even know about his tantrum, did you?
Hama-san was on the first floor.
Both Moonlight Mansion and Sunlight Mansion have large signs!
Moonlight Mansion
emphasizing only the shadows of the raised tiles,
a trick that makes the letters for "Moonlight Mansion" stand out.
Aino-kun was Ujie-sensei's son?
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns
I see. So it's been hard on you, huh?
I don't care what happens to me! There's nothing good in my life!
Aino-kun really was an amazing person.
He worked every afternoon and still got the top scores in every subject.
What should we do? We have to get him to stop!
Akao-sensei is...
you manipulated those two like puppets and turned them into criminals!
Hama-san!
I was a failure as a teacher and as a father...
H-Hi, Aino-kun.
Shuuji...
The check-in counter is this way. I'll take you there.
Where?! It's your guys' fault for walkin' so fast!
I wonder if the cabin attendants are hot, too...
Oh, Hajime-chan...
Right!
Huh!
Hey, Hajime-chan!
I mean, with the terrorist-like threat delivered right before we took off...
If only that nasty Akechi-san weren't sittin' behind me!
More importantly, did you hear about the terrorist threat before takeoff?
with two police officers like me and Superintendent Akechi on board, it won't...
What are you talking about, Kindaichi?
Hey, what is this?!
2:10. I don't think we're gonna land on time.
Akechi-san!
What's this smoke?
Ma'am! Please return to your seat!
Let go! I'm getting off!
I said I'm getting off!
Captain, I'll take care of her.
But?
Right!
This is your chief purser, Sekiguchi Shinobu.
It feels like it took a lot longer.
I sincerely appreciate that.
I'm gonna go see them, too.
Smoke bombs?!
I looked at my watch. It was 2:20.
That sounds about right. Around 2:28 by my watch,
It isn't necessarily a passenger.
in the name of my grandfather!
Do either of you have an alibi that can be confirmed for those ten minutes?
With the smoke, I thought I might be able to snap a news photo.
After all, your seat was next to mine, Inspector Kenmochi.
I worked together with Captain Shido for many years,
Only the cameraman, Ohgoshi Yutaka-san, and the actress, Ishida Mariya-san.
Do you know something, Nanase-san?
An actress who used to be a cabin attendant, huh?
Well, he's won many awards for his photos of terrorism sites.
It's interesting.
Summer...
Huh...
Owl-themed cafes are popular these days, so people get mine mixed up with the others.
Don't tell me... from then...
Three years ago
so we decided to spend a night observing a meteor shower.
That's right. No need to put a stain on your brains and beauty.
It's not like she's my first choice, but I guess Takano is a safe bet.
Watch this!
Oh, just some crows. Don't scare us!
Go to hell! Who's Kin-dirty-ichi?!
What was that?!
Anywhere but here!
He's like a doggy that digs a hole!
Campground 100 meters ahead
It's you, isn't it?
What's this? A receipt?
There aren't any stains either. You think water alone would make it this clean?!
Then you wanna do a strip search?
Yeah...
So that's what it is...
...a crow!
pinpointing the spot where you left your clothes.
It's not unusual for a crow to be attracted to Miyuki's sparkling watch.
I see...
Is it okay? The crows aren't going to start attacking?
It can't be remembering what happened then...
But the lesson I learned from that incident is crimes are always exposed.
In the name of my grandfather!
That's no excuse...
A new student... What difference does it make?
Hey, that was dangerous!
Huh? Are you guys students at Fudou High?
Tamaki Takumi
Yeah. I'm 20.
Who does that Tamaki think he is?
Same difference.
Just come with me.
Yes?
Aoi-san is a detective now.
I'm sorry, Kenmochi-san.
But you just got here...
even the ringleader, Busujima, has been released three years later from a facility.
And in the end, they even took her life.
Thanks for coming, Detective.
Hey. Sittin' here in silence does us no good. What do you wanna tell me?
See ya 'round.
H-Help! Somebody's tryin' to kill me!
I appreciate you coming all the way here from headquarters.
Detective Aoi Reiji Fudousan Police Department, Criminal Affairs Division
I'm Aoi Reiji with the Criminal Affairs Division of the Fudousan Police Department.
What?! Old man Kenmochi?!
Hajime-chan Incoming Call
Sorry, Miyuki. Leave without me!
H-Hey!
And these past three years, he's seen the victim's family grieve.
Still, that doesn't mean old man Kenmochi would kill them...
he never came home last night, and no one's heard from him since this morning.
Besides, I made a mad dash to get away. I didn't have time to look back!
Could that Detective Kenmochi be the one who shot me?
Dammit, what's goin' on?!
Yeah.
Or I wish I could believe that, but I lost a little confidence after seeing that bastard.
Who are you?!
She wanted me to bring her with if I was going to meet you.
For example, has Inspector Kenmochi visited you?
Good timing. Can we talk a while?
Sorry, old man.
You're Aoi-kun, I believe?
Takumi-kun, please get in the car. I'm here at your father's request.
Where's Superintendent Akechi?
Excuse me...
The Case File of Young Kindaichi Returns! Inspector Kenmochi, Murderer, File 2!
Inspector Kenmochi, Murderer
The bastards laughed at seeing my sister in agony.
When Busujima was in the hospital, he called Uozaki, right?
Can you tell the time of death?
On the morning of the same day Busujima was shot.
If there's some connection to what happened three years ago,
you may be the next target.
Don't talk stupid!
Involved, huh?
It simply said she wanted to break up.
When I called her house, her parents said she hadn't come home since the day before.
Not a thing...
Akechi-san, that hat...
It's old man Kenmochi's!
I know how you feel.
A trap?!
Calm down, Busujima!
Moreover, the court has ruled that they repented sufficiently for their crime.
And I bet you've got a silver tongue.
and he's determined to get to the truth.
I'll show you the documents.
Come on, you can't get these people mad at you!
Water
Burn Wounds
Death by Strangulation
Yes. I'm sorry.
I need a minute.
Otherwise, the explosion wouldn't have been this big.
Did you park in your usual place?
Yes. That's probably true.
who's trying to put the blame for his murders on the old man!
has us scrambling to the scene, where we're met by a certain person...
Tamaki Takumi
The killer calls himself the Executioner and the prime suspect
This is Superintendent Akechi.
that's about a kilometer from the station.
I'll try it.
You recorded it, right?
There! This time there was a 12-second interval!
On a floor that's mostly empty!
But I don't remember locking it.
What were you doing during the two days you were out of contact?
The water was drained, the body and phone were taken away, everything else is the same.
The call record shows that
Yeah. I wanted to talk to you, too.
If everyone has a perfect alibi, that makes everyone suspicious.
What the hell happened?!
That's what I wanna know!
Please don't upset the patient.
At death's door?
Yes. If we'd found you only three minutes later, you probably would've been dead.
I'm no longer his lawyer. But I'll make a note of it.
After all this time, how many cases have you been involved with together?
Looking at it makes me think it must've been tough to get in place from the outside.
After we broke in, we checked out all the rooms,
It's a safety feature.
This floor isn't in use, right?
I've got the image of the real killer in my head,
However, only until tomorrow morning.
Inspector Kenmochi's name is going to be released tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah. The experiment was a success!
Togami Erina Togami Marina's Younger Sister
The killer calls himself the Executioner and the prime suspect
I thought so.
No, not that. This is more high-pitched.
Calm down, Busujima-kun.
Huh? The sound's stopped!
Batting Center
Here's the custodian!
Sure.
Those are all tricks, of course!
Then what kind of tricks?!
Okay?
Broken from being dropped in the water during a call.
Is something wrong?
Yeah. I wanted to talk to you, too.
It's already been done.
he returned to the station and worked on the investigation until late morning.
Okay, that's enough! Please resume your questioning tomorrow.
Hello? Investigation Headquarters, Aoi here.
Yeah, yeah. I admit it, I helped.
If I was serious about killing him,
You'd plan it, but would never put it into action, right?
I don't care how driven he is by fury,
And I've been with him on more cases than I'd care to remember.
Thinking of it that way explains the trick and the old man!
Yes.
After we broke in, we checked out all the rooms,
but there were no signs of anyone hiding.
It's a safety feature.
That would make sense,
Busujima Riku
Kindaichi-kun!
What is this?!
And right under the hook.
No. You did know.
But first, I want to ask you something.
Only a few students at Fudou High and the police knew about Tamaki.
When the phone fell, the stopper moved into place, and the water started to rise.
You said you gave it to Kenmochi.
The letter detailed the truth about what happened three years ago.
I'm not lyin'!
I'm the Executioner.
Your old man?
But you can always study at home, you know?
and cut ties with them.
Busujima-kun?
Sorry...
We're best buds, right, Bu-chan?
...I somehow found myself really becoming an accomplice!
Old man, calm down!
Like a helpless leaf, blown about by the wind...
Then I swear, I'll have my dad pay off your family's debts!
Where was it?
It probably fell off of your phone in that apartment.
Who proposed it?!
The Puppeteer from Hell!
Hey, Busujima.
but I think I feel a little better now.
You can record a message with this.
You can record a message with this.
Even while Marina-san was in agony,
Thank you, Togami...
those are scenes that won't disappear.
a6Voice of mine
Geez! It's been three days already!
When're we gonna get home, dammit?!
Are us servants lower than horses?
An earth tremor?
and Qin.
The Nameless Boy
You damn strong bastard!
Here?
Wait!
Like that matters!
What a statement. I guess you are just kids after all.
It seems completely insane.
He and I lost our parents in a war, and became slaves.
We'll take some nice girls as brides,
Our names will echo all across China!
This's terrible!
Who do you think you are?!
They'll hear you, you idiot!
We'd just starve to death.
I get it.
I was just kidding, really.
Piao, today this man will be paying for your freedom.
B-But I...
Hurry, you must accept!
What are you...?
You really are strong, you know!
Really?
Yeah. Like a baby monkey turning into a child monkey.
Me, too. Anyhow, it looks like we just won't be able to do business in the royal palace.
What?
Yes, my lord.
but should you accept it, you will be taking a duty of the utmost importance. Flashback
Flashback starts
We can escape it! With the power of the sword!
You're amazing, Piao!
Hold on, Piao!
Don't talk so much.
Not a single one!
You... and I...
If you flap your wings...
All of them! All of them! All of them!
So... So I'm going!
Would you please stop the monkey show at this point?
And here at Xianyang, he finally rose to the position of serving me.
Just the ugly desires of all humans.
Well...
Did you bastards talk to him?
N-No! We just heard a noise, and when we came outside
We don't know anything...!
We really don't know any-
Hurry up and speak.
What are you, half asleep?
Generals...?
Great generals?!
but in the future, our names will be carved into history!
Why did you lead me... Thought
No way...
It's just a shack, Piao! Thought
Ancient China.
Ya got that right!
I... can't take my eyes off of him!
You can no longer escape.
That's right.
to allow you to survive.
by allowing me to reach you here.
You're the king!
Let's have a thorough look at your skill.
A thorough look?!
Damn!
But Jie Shi, there are still other obstacles besides my older brother.
Slaughter all those that oppose me.
What? Oh, you're still alive?
But you've utterly lost your composure.
Avenging Piao?
Piao...
Yes.
What an odd thing to say.
You little brat! Die!
Is that all you've got, red old man?!
This is the end!
I'm sure that he... Flashback
will fly higher than anyone else! Flashback
For my children's sake, not my life!
Thank you so much!
but Piao took my place so that he would become a great general.
But this guy practically killed you with his own hands, Piao! Thought
Dammit...! What am I supposed to do? Thought
Make sure you stay with me!
Stay with you?
So don't leave my side!
Kill that little monkey!
swallow me.
They're breaking through the Zhugui Gate!
Ta-da.
Tell us that stuff sooner!
What's with that bastard?!
His Highness and Lord's strategy was a success!
was that someone from the flatlands prompted them to.
Indeed.
Yes.
Have you enjoyed your brief moment of glory, Chancellor Shi?
That's right. Let's go, Xin.
This is the strategy.
But rest assured.
What's wrong, Lord Yang Duan He?
Those monkeys. It seems they truly intend to take on my elite forces.
All units, get as close as possible to the targets...
Messenger!
Sir!
Relax. I'll take care 'a that bastard.
If we get through here, it'll be a short distance to the inner palace!
I thought I understood, but...
We have our own way of fighting!
Don't leave a single enemy alive! This is a bloodbath!
Th... This is Zuoci?! Thought
for me to step out in front of him to boost our morale! Thought
If I jump high enough, I'm sure I'll reach beyond the sky
a6Yeah
only one thing can be drawn out!
You're the one who's too cocky!
With that stupid face of yours!
Xin! Thought
Wh-What is that kid?
Awesome...
How... Xin?
How is it that even though you're just a boy, you can fight against Zuoci?!
I'm going to be the greatest general under the heavens!
I said I'll become it and I will!
Compared to the peril of the path to being a general, what we're doing today is nothing.
Yeah, right.
Zheng, you bastard!
Shit! Just watch me! I'm definitely gonna become it!
I hit ya! How's that, bastard?!
I've already let one die. Thought
If I can get one step further, I can kill him! Thought
My king, you should get behind...
To have reached the highest level with it, I am...
the strongest under the heavens.
Of course.
That kid... He's gonna be tortured to death.
How is... the battle?
Especially Xin...
Isn't that right, Xin?!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
Blabbering on like that...
I see...
So what?
I've only got strength for one slash.
Take it in!
Did someone close to you die or something?
Anyhow, Bi, are you gonna be all right with not resting?
we'll be right at the inner palace.
Hell yeah!
To weave together my breaking heart
I gaze at the fragments of a dream No more crying
a6Voice of soul
But to be up against Zuoci and such numbers...
He can't sleep after we've come this far!
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
Victory is... before our eyes?
Captain! How could you say something like that?!
Now that I think of it, the place we're going now is where I can really avenge him.
Who were those guys?
They're people that serve the inner palace.
It sure is taking a long time...
Even Captain and Tajif's strength isn't doing anything...
Bajiou was a miserable brat.
when we were pushing our way through the deep northern mountains, three guards disappeared.
I will welcome you in as family.
He's fast!
This is the true form of Bajiou?!
That monster is losing?!
reflects this promise in my heart
Not bad!
This is the tumultuous tale of a nameless boy and a young king who brought the warring era to its end!
Piao, where're you going?!
At first, I just took care of him out of curiosity, but what do you think now?
I saw lots of different kinds of people in Heibei Village,
But Zheng disregarded me, who has purer royal blood, and took the throne.
That's why he was removed!
What...?
No matter what you say about your blood,
What do think you're asking, you ignorant commoner?!
This is Lord Chengjiao's command.
We're running out of time! Hurry, Xin! Thought
But my sword... Is my sword no good?
Diao, tie my right hand with the ribbon from the scabbard!
If you can do that, I can take him down!
What is the cause for their victory?
Death! You will all be punished with death!
If we can escape the castle, there are 80,000 soldiers on standby!
Such a thing cannot happen!
Don't let Jie Shi get away!
We need his head to end the war!
I'm no match for you guys.
What on earth...
Who could have?!
If not, you'll die where you stand.
Wang Qi, having falsely presented Changwenjun's head, Thought
There's no need for mercy, even if your opponent is a general! Thought
Wang Qi?!
Quite the jest.
The young king that challenges the future...
After learning that the era of saints had ended,
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
those are scenes that won't disappear.
a6I knew at the start that there's no end.
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
He stated that flat out!
It is dangerous to speak of King Zhao in front of that man! Thought
Wang Qi! You lost your most beloved master,
A true one has a child-like glint in their eyes, like you, my king.
I could have taken hold of my dream.
may someday appear once again.
Wang Qi, when that time comes, you must fly even higher than you do now.
In this young king's eyes, there isn't the slightest hint of the naive glint like in those of King Zhao,
Farewell.
Damn you, Wang Qi.
Chancellor Jie!
That is why you are always all alone!
Do you understand that?!
I'm sorry!
It was nothin' big.
Diao...
Going back?
The house Changwenjun gave us isn't over there!
Yeah.
No, that's wrong.
Piao... I'm burying the memories I have with you in this village.
Hey! What was with that all of a sudden?!
Xin! Don't leave me behind!
The first thing can be a broken down shack or whatever!
Our first castle!
We didn't do anything, you idiot!
I won't turn away from my tearful memories
a6Voice of soul
But I suppose it's fine now.
Now I'm interested to see what kind of face the king, that has overcome all of this strife, will greet us with.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
Hey, hey!
Ow!
But I can't keep going like this forever.
Money... he promised?
They're not gonna let you off the hook if somethin' happens to Zheng!
Hey, Zheng!
The ruler of this country from the shadows.
And our forces are exceedingly small.
I cannot just sit here and whine!
First and foremost,
That dissatisfaction is most natural...
Eyecatch
Able to judge him or not, that guy's after your life, Zheng! Thought
Though it was the Warring States Period,
Zheng, Changwenjun and the others could say nothing.
Cai Ou? That old man is...?!
Someone that important is L Buwei's subordinate?
A few days ago, for an engagement.
only serve the strong.
It is written all over your face.
And governing is something a man like you cannot possibly understand.
Oh? What do you, someone with no talent, that relies only on power to push themselves forward,
Proof of valor.
Strongest... in all of China...!
has started to make my legs numb.
With the rebellion of Jie and the others suppressed...
Seizing the king of a country to play with him...
Governor of law, Li Shi.
Until 12 or 13 years ago, L Buwei was just an ordinary foreign merchant.
With the next war.
Uh... What's written there?
Can't you read?
reflects this promise in my heart
a6I won't cry
a6I won't fear
This is...
It's a real war!
Xin was riding on that wind.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
a6Now's the only time.
The 4th army just departed a short while ago.
all of the armies are experienced in battle.
It will be a brutal battle...
You can't kill that guy so easily!
What's everyone gathering together for?
At this time, foot soldiers had institutionalized moving in 5-man teams called "Wu".
Us leftovers gotta stick together.
Shut up!
For the Wu of our first campaign, we've got a lot to be worried about.
That's the main unit of the 4th army.
Nothing... I just imagined something and it gave me a bad feeling.
Hey!
He's dead!
Looks like you've bulked up some more.
And I barely recognized you, Brother Bi!
Now we can fight together again, huh?!
Whether or not I become a supervising general will be decided
Well, they say that if a Wu has two strong members, then you should be safe.
Uh, my stomach is starting to hurt...
bringing about further disarray.
What happened to General Hei Gang?!
And it wasn't just the general.
No. This is the first time I've heard of something like this as well.
B-But...
Yashui.
It's the worst thing that could happen.
Hey, you!
U-Um...
That's Rongyang's entire defense!
Take position on the hills as soon as possible!
But neither the soldiers nor the armies are prepared.
And the plan had been for it to be an attack on a castle.
What's going on?!
Understand, everyone? Please prepare your hearts and minds for this...
Yes. I think we should be arriving soon.
a6Voice of soul
What's going on?!
Don't go in front of the guide chariot!
So this... is a battlefield?!
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years
the many piled up meetings we've had
No one can take it away,
those are scenes that won't disappear.
With lightning speed, he put the State of Qin on the defensive.
4th Army, line up!
All Wu, form a line!
The only way to gain victory is to take that hill!
Paint the plain red with the blood of Wei soldiers!
weak guys like us will die in that melee...
The 5 of us must not get more than 10 steps apart,
 Flags  Wei 
What're you doing?!
K-Kill him!
No... That's not the only reason.
Didn't you hear what the Wuchang said?!
About the bond of a Wu...
It was also an incredible Wu battle strategy.
Ow...
Those... are all chariots?!
I see.
Are you guys all right?!
You did it, Qiang Lei!
Concentrate on the front right now!
So we're just gonna die after all?
W-What're you doing?
How would I know?!
I don't know how,
Okay, hurry!
What's happening on the front lines?!
While Xin and the others, the foot soldiers of the 4th Army,
That's not for you to decide.
Everything goes according to General Biao Gong's plan.
Which is it?!
Keep running, little rabbit!
The left! Cut him off on the left!
No!
and this iron spear... I can do it! Thought
a6I won't stop
Fu Hushen Unit, charge!
swallow me.
Among this rusted fear in my heart
No one can take it away,
Main army, leave the defensive! All units, descend the mountain
Yes, but,
Look here.
And now, one location has stood out.
Though he does appear to think quickly...
Well done, surviving the Wei Army chariots' attack.
H-Hold on a second.
Why do we have to go do another insane battle?!
Do you think we have a chance?!
I'm just the same a you.
Well then it's decided.
He hasn't been thinking about the foot soldiers at all from the beginning!
How many men are left?
Despite that they separated from our main unit Thought
he escaped the jaws of death? Thought
As well as a reward!
Hey, listen to people when they talk.
Sheddep.
The result of this battle was determined from the outset.
It's an enemy attack!
Hold on. Don't underestimate him.
No way!
I'm counting on your legs right now!
He's my prey.
You bastard, I'll kill you!
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
I've just received a report.
The state of battle is grim... Thought
Could it be...? Thought
Because you relied on such things, tens of thousands of soldiers will die meaningless deaths.
Bastard!
It's mortifying, but at least we were able to take down the Wei flag.
that we were able to make it here.
Are you an idiot, bastard?!
We're going to take your head and have an easy time going down the hill!
The State of Wei Army Commander General, Wu Qing!
Where all those big flags are gathered...
What this time?!
Hey, Bi!
Bi Unit! Follow the reinforcements that just broke through with all your strength!
We'll clash with Wei's garrison unit, but please try to endure it.
We're saved!
Look, there!
I'm not so much a comrade...
Didn't you know?
You've been standing at the precipice of death for quite a while now.
Oh, what's this?
Without a moment's delay, he changed his formation.
an excellent general that will become a threat to many countries.
The first is the resourceful type, like Wu Qing.
Or will instinct win?
Among generals, this is an eternal theme.
Eternal Theme?!
In the course of this long war, the scope of the armies have grown.
On the other hand, Biao Gong's war is one big blazing flame.
until over one hundred states were reduced to merely seven.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
Diao is fine.
H-Hey!
Are you really sure about this?
Are you hurt?
Hey, Diao! Aren't you worried about your parents and family? Everyone's getting killed!
Well, aren't you doing that, too?!
I'm from the mountain people of the far West.
or escaped along the river.
Then order all units to divide up and search for him!
If he knew enough in advance to know that there would be a rebellion and to put a double in his place,
He established several rendezvous points in case we got separated during the escape.
but a hiding place for me, after having changed places with Piao.
I get it!
H-Hang on a second...
If such a thing happens, you'll be mistaken for me and killed.
Something great that one could never obtain by living a normal life!
We're currently using all of our forces to search them.
Yes.
When the hell is that gonna be?!
I'm sure you'll find a way. Probably.
I haven't forgotten about Piao.
And even if you're the king, I ain't kneeling to you or anything like that.
I'm just using you!
The fact that you're abasing yourself after all this time is rather unpleasant. Abasing - lowering, maybe? Mistral
So, who is it you say caught Changwenjun?
That man!
General Wang Qi is quite an ambiguous man.
Yes.
Three?!
That was more than enough.
Yuh! Yuh! Yuh!
Yuh!
If I jump high enough, I'm sure I'll reach beyond the sky
a6Yeah
And a storm of violent wars lasting a monumentally long 500 years erupted all across China.
Yan, Qi, Zhao, Wei, Han, Chu...
He would scatter one or two of our formations.
Bi... Thought
He's really jumped to conclusions, hasn't he? Aide Bi...
But the one who sent out those sacrifices was none other than Biao Gong.
I've been talking with a general! Thought
General Wang Qi. Please, lend me a horse!
Who is that guy?
Well, he's an idiot. Just like how he looks.
But he has moved the inner-troops to the sides.
It seems he's realized the strength of the Biao Gong Army's rushing force.
It's only natural.
What's with these guys? They're weak.
This horse that General Wang Qi lent me!
Come with me, Xin!
As good as done, sir.
Would you not like to see it for yourself?
It is because of that that it's necessary for Bi to direct forces in this war.
The new mounted unit is not attacking!
But now, with the Biao Gong Army and us,
Crush the left army!
cannot let such shallow trickery pass by!
There's no time.
Just as I thought.
It was worth it to rush ahead.
Die!
Biao Gong!
We shall be victorious!
This is war!
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
a6Now's the only time.
General Qu Qing! General Qu Qing! General Qu Qing!
Hey, let's get some cheers going, too!
Wu Qing's military strength will not possibly reach that of Lord Biao Gong's.
and with this sword, I will tell you what that is.
Eyecatch
And I was part of that country's royal family!
and the State of Wei became my second fatherland.
Come, Wu Qing!
but by the tragic sight of the collapsed General Wu Qing.
The mighty general known as Wu Qing
The Wei Army is... retreating.
Big Brother!
It has been quite a while, General Biao Gong.
Once a great flame is calmed, immediately reigniting it is next to impossible.
In Shi Huang Year 2, 245 BCE,
Heh. Ya got a point.
Armor? You, sir?
I was in that 4th Army and got money from it, dammit!
You must be glad, Xin.
souls shake.
Who's that?
What?
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
swallow me.
those are scenes that won't disappear.
a6Now's the only time.
C-Can I ask something?
That's a pretty big deal!
A woman pretending to be a man...! What? Like you're doing?
Hey, you! Now you're going too far!
I don't totally get it, but you went out of your way to come see me.
That was...
We're comrades, right?!
People who say things like "I want to know" and "Tell me"...
Chi You?
In ancient times, it was born as a sacred treasure for worshiping the heavens.
I haven't got a clue what you're talking about.
The Chi You dance as they cut down their foes with the power of the gods.
My sister, Xiang, whom had been raised the same way as me,
as well as myself were chosen from the Qiang Clan.
Don't worry.
And you might even be killed by me.
Even among the same clan, to team up is forbidden.
That's why,
By whom?!
The festival...
Eyecatch
And now, in accordance to our laws, the festival will commence.
Both, that the others all joined forces, and that you did not participate.
Was it really something that insignificant?!
Elder!
I was sick of hearing about thousand year long laws.
Yes. She is the one that I...
and in the end became the new Chi You and left the village...
Man, it really got late.
All right.
When I lived in Heibei Village,
I thought about how I could sneak away from there every day.
But then I met Xin, Zheng and the others
but I've been really happy.
Zheng, Bi, and Changwenjun are, too...
What am I supposed to do?
Quit staring at me like that. It's suffocating.
I thought I would be getting a lot of experience with that battle.
So what're you gonna do next?
I'm going to head for Wei alone.
I've got no idea when you might die.
All right!
You've gotta do it once in a while, too!
General Wang Qi's castle.
There are rumors that several people that did go went missing!
Totally sure.
After I got appointed as a Hundred-Man General,
I see.
When the State of Qin started marching,
Hu Shang,
That settles it!
Wait for me, General Wang Qi!
Open the dang gate!
Please stop, Lord Xin!
It's me, Xin! We met on the Wei Vice General's hill!
What are you doing in a place like this?
They were fine.
I'm feeling pressure just from looking at him right now.
what business do you have with me?
And why am I now getting involved?
Then could you tell me about the legendary Six Great Generals?
System?
the strength of the Six Great Generals has not been forgotten.
Greatest generals under the heavens...? Thought
I know.
That's why I came to find a general.
Of course!
They're all incorrigible fools.
Th-That's absurd!
Gong!
You moron!
I will train him after he's subjugated the land.
Huh?! You want me down there, too?
Everyone, let's go!
You damn morons!
Dammit! It was shallow! Thought
Youngster Xin, from there, you must first learn
are felling Han castles one after another.
Zhao forces are invading?!
but we have a report that there was a signal fire coming from Mayang seeking reinforcements!
What's the best course to take? Thought
A pretty decent amount of time's passed!
What do you meant you're postponing the training?
A war... started...?!
An emergency recruitment isn't an ordinary occurrence. Thought
I am Meng Yi.
The one you live with is called "Xin", is he not?
is a supremely important war council that will affect the state of this war.
Leave everything to me.
Please, do not.
But Changwenjun,
Xin?
General Wang Qi... Supreme Commander?!
This is my decision as Commander-in-Chief.
What is this, General Wang Qi?
In accordance with an old etiquette, before an official indictment can take place,
the appointment ceremony must be performed with the king and I alone.
You must have something you wish to talk with me about.
Wang Qi, at that time
I told you to accept King Zhao's death.
King Zhao was a great king.
It was another four years after you came back before you took the throne.
If you had seen one glimpse of the form of King Zhao,
What is it, Wang Qi?
I remembered the thing I had to tell you.
What is it?
General Wang Qi!
General Wang Qi is the Supreme Commander?
The one most fit to entrust this war to truly is General Wang Qi.
We don't know that yet.
Those are... Oh?
I doubt he would send his army unless he had considerable confidence.
In that huge room with all the ministers watching,
Oh, Mr. Wei Ping, Mr. Wei Dao.
We've been itching for a fight!
Lord Xin!
Ending
In order to settle this fight.
The nameless boy Xin met with the young King Zheng,
Among those events, the neighboring State of Zhao suddenly invaded,
But are you sure about this? Going on our own to see the battlefield?
State of Qin Commander-in-Chief?!
Th-Then, he's on the side of Zheng's enemies... Thought
I just want to see a battlefield and feel the wind there.
What our unit will be doing, even I don't know!
The fact that the general has classified this unit differently from the others
We'll crush that Zhao Army that carelessly strolled in here in an attempt to attack us
Did you hear? About the Zhao Army?
I heard they killed every last person, down to the elderly, the women, and the infants!
What is it? What's going on?
forward!
P-Pang Nuan?!
No. My enemy moved from Wei to Zhao.
They are secret techniques that makes gods descend at our will.
So he is quite a military commander,
Because they were fellow members of the Six Great Generals? Thought
No matter how powerful Pang Nuan is,
A grudge?
It's true, he was abnormal.
But that's the kind of man Pang Nuan is!
I see. He sounds like an interesting fellow.
After all this time, why would he now have become the Zhao Army's Supreme Commander?
Wang Qi...
I think it's well worth considering.
Hey! There it is!
Where in the world are we?!
All units...
Advance right!
and they are now arriving at the moment of confrontation.
distinguished himself in war, and finally become a Hundred-Man General.
This dream cannot be broken.
He's a monster!
The vanguards are evenly matched.
Yes. No information has come in yet.
Yes.
Meng Wu's power is greater than the rumors indicated,
Wouldn't it be more useful for us to go support the central army?
it's also too late to target the central army.
General Wang Qi's plan?
The left army's charge has begun.
Then all preparations are in order.
It is about time "to shoot the arrow", I suppose.
The left army charged!
Looks like it's finally gonna be our time to shine.
it is an ironclad rule that you must capture land that gives one an advantage in fighting.
It has nimbleness of slipping through gaps,
If by some chance you fail, it will not be tolerated.
In such a huge army, there's no chance you'll be able to stop Xin.
but I have had similar experiences many times.
Thanks to the Fourth Army's general, Gan Yang,
We'll be right next to them pretty soon.
Vermin... Thought
And the other half
All units, retreat!
This is bad, Lord Xin. Thought
and heading in a straight line for the enemy general.
at the helm will be the four most superhumanly strong Wuchang.
They noticed us already?!
Long Chuan!
Chong Wan Wu members!
Okay, let's go!
He's trying to pierce through the enemy formation!
How to leave out the unnecessary,
Emergency report!
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
We can do it! We can do it!
The battle now...
will simply be strength versus strength.
W-We have to fight!
Plus, we're so fatigued...
power surges throughout our bodies again!
The certainty of our victory shall not change!
What're you doing at a time like this?!
and we won't be able to break through here.
Never mind that!
then we will gladly remain here!
We?
It is just as Vice General Yuan says.
The Wu that can still run... Thought
Where's Qiang Lei?!
A general's full ability is displayed when one is within that range.
I'm counting on you, Youngster Xin.
What do you mean?!
So they split their 100 in two. Thought
Let's kill them.
Two to three hundred.
And prepare yourself, Feng Ji! Thought
They're charging.
Do you seriously think they'll make it all the way here?
In extremely rare cases, there are times when people hold a power that goes beyond the boundaries of conventional thinking.
Lord Shou!
Gathered into a crowd, they cannot utilize that strength.
Feng Ji allowed the Feixin Unit to penetrate deep into his bosom.
is...
They're retreating from the 30 of us?
All units, halt!
Maybe Qiang Lei and I could manage something, but... Thought
these guys don't have a chance! Thought
How could I?
Don't apologize.
He said it back at the beginning!
I'll be taking the achievement,
Go!
Don't let it slip away.
Left army general, do you think you've cornered me?
We're retreating!
You and the forward defensive wall take care of them.
The rear soldiers and I will be making a temporary retreat to the thicket.
That's far enough, Feng Ji!
The strongest man devours the battlefield!
They made it out okay?!
It was to make it easier to remember.
To enemies and to allies.
Gan Yang called out your name and the Feixin Unit for all to hear.
A moment...
And then I will become it... Thought
What kind of war will Supreme Commander Wang Qi wage?
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
The war entered its second day.
this will likely be something well worth seeing.
China acknowledges you as the General of Defense. Thought
You were merely blessed with weak opponents! Thought
was penetrated in one attack today!
I see! The foot soldiers gained confidence.
That Meng Wu is quite something, isn't he?
Yes, sir!
Meng Yi?
Meng Wu...
This is Wang Qi, remember.
He brought his enemy into submission by force.
The reason I decided to try to become a tactician
Gongsun Long, Li Bai!
What are the two of you doing?
We'll stick to business.
I thought you would say that.
the one who sparks the battle on that crowded battlefield was...
And we'll take that opportunity to head straight for the enemy headquarters!
fortress, ain't it?
We're moving the troop headquarters!
are retreating?
After going on the offensive thanks to the Feixin Unit, led by Xin,
They changed their battle strategy?!
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
Disaster
Geez. What the hell is that combat commander thinking?
Yes, sir!
It seems that the only thing I'll be able to see
Well, perhaps it was still worth the trek all the way out here.
And in the process of doing so, they saw neither hide nor hair of the enemy.
If that's the case, that would mean the way the Zhao Army lost in the first four days was intentional,
Besides Zhao Zhuang, are there any other strategists on their side?
Thank you very much.
Okay, let's get going.
Meanwhile, the Meng Wu Army, along with Long Guo, were guided to the enemy headquarters.
No. All military commanders have reported no sign of him.
Yeah. And then we'll all be heroes to the whole village!
Nobody's listening to you, bud.
H-Hey, Qing!
Revenge is important.
No, far from it... Thought
But where?! Thought
I'll take a look at their condition.
I'm a Vice General! What am I doing? Thought
had no luck.
Stand up!
I-Incredible...
This guy said it was Qiang Lei who called him...
The wild god that dwells within me cannot allow for the existence of any other strong beings.
The thing Qiang Lei was talking about before...
Pang Nuan?
the name of the Zhao Army Supreme Commander?
It doesn't matter!
No. This is Xin and Qiang Lei. I know they'll find a way...
If I run away here...
Next time,
Ancient China.
human ambitions were unleashed.
those are scenes that won't disappear.
We need to let him rest a while!
That's right.
I refuse!
What?!
Hurry up.
Hey, Zheng. About how much farther do we have to the rendezvous site?
This guy's ignoring us!
That hurt, you bastard! Over Diao's line
Changwenjun must have prepared that in advance.
Duke Mu was a king who loved people unconditionally more than anyone else.
When a dispute was going on over a 1 li sized territory in China, with hundreds of thousands of people dying,
Duke Mu opened up a land 100 li in size.
Do you have to ruin the moment when someone feels touched?!
The three of us, here...?
When the Qin army attacked Chu, they sought cooperation from Muta's army.
It was you, wasn' it?
And you're the stupidest of them all by far.
And first, Zhuxiong is not my friend.
Wh-What the hell?! Thought
If this so-called "War God" does indeed exist,
Lei!
and he is a being beyond imagination.
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
But the gong stopped very suddenly.
But, although I do feel it is a bit unnatural,
That cannot be!
Although Wan Ji is following him,
And war is something full of unexpected events...
Step away, Feixin Unit!
Lord Gan Yuan! The opposing troupes are mounted soldiers, approximately 500!
We will slaughter the entire enemy!
General!
We'll decide it here!
This's turned into all-out melee!
Who will avenge Xie Ci, Shan He, and the others who were killed? Thought
Oh, like I thought, you're still alive.
Tian Yong! Chong Yuan!
We're up against as seriously dangerous opponent this time.
I don't mind if anybody that wants to go home alive, no matter what, leaves.
The movements of the Zhao Army are odd...
but this is a war taking place in the mountains.
Regarding the progress of the battle...
I cannot be such a thing as optimistic about a war.
please take a hold of Xin. Flashback
from three directions and with all of your strength...
throw your spears!
And he won't notice me drawing in from behind!
I...
But I did cut flesh!
The setting is before the common era, the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period.
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
Don't let a single one of them get away!
Zhong Tie and Lord Lu Yan.
It sure would've been huge.
as long as that guy survives,
All of the Wuchang seeing that Xin...
Right, Wei Ping?!
Yeah!
Arrows!
Get down!
Feixin Unit!
Run down there!
Don't let them get away!
Xin.
Aren't you the same way, Miss You Li? For Wei Dao?
Wait, Miss You Li! Tapping the guardian stone...
Dong Mei...
Wei Dao is really gonna take the head of a Great General?
Don't sweat it, I'll catch up in a minute, so...
Let's grit our teeth and move our feet forward.
But there is one thing I do not understand.
How can they still be moving?
Shut up, idiot.
Both you and I can still move.
You should at least greet us Wei Brothers...
Hey, let's go.
What the hell is going on, Wei Dao?
I've felt it ever since I set foot on the battlefield.
you really can become a general, Xin.
I really think so...
But the power of your comrades...
is also part of your own power.
Tonight, quite a few comrades may have died
Yeah. I'll be okay if I sleep.
Quit... screwing around...
Over there?
And I thought he'd be okay if he was with them.
You really thought that would be safe?!
It's Xin!
He brilliantly fulfilled his duty.
The deciding battle is drawing close.
After being attacked by Pang Nuan, the Feixin Unit fled in all directions.
And...
Behind us!
Is that the State of Zhao Army, too?!
Xin, the boy that came from obscurity to become the general of a Hundred-Man Unit
Among this rusted fear in my heart
is a truth that interrupts the rain.
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
and give it to Mr. She Meng for the moment.
General Wang Qi went out in front!
If I do, I feel like I'll end up crouching down
But the guys that died definitely wouldn't want that. I know it.
A signal fire has been raised in the rear!
There are signal flares burning...
Unless they have a very important reason to do so, they won't use those.
What's that mean?
You see, the combination of the flags' colors and locations
can send complicated information.
And at Wang Qi's location...
the Meng Wu and Long Guo Armies were able to slowly push back the Zhao Zhuang Army.
I'm breaking out into a cold sweat?! Thought
The enemy strategist Zhao Zhuang
going at about the same speed towards the State of Zhao Army headquarters.
I want to see this through to the end with my own eyes!
Therefore, Wang Qi's advanced was quickened even further.
Obviously.
What? You're also a wo-
Well, in this era
Being a strategist is far more painful and difficult than being a soldier that sees bloodshed right in front of him.
With the Supreme Commander in front of his eyes,
And also... it seems Pang Nuan appeared.
The idea of a night attack is not the kind of plan a large army should be enacting.
that I absolutely must tell you, and so I came here.
Xin, the boy that came from obscurity to become the general of a Hundred-Man Unit
We won't throw away our weaknesses,
Zheng, it has been approximately one year since I fought alongside with you to quell your brother Chengjiao's rebellion.
Their high level of fighting ability, their deep understanding of the art of war, the large scale of their army...
There was no... enemy there?
Over 100,000... corpses?!
But I have heard there are actually several tribes called Yuezhi, Donghu, Xiongnu and others that are struggling for supremacy.
The place we saw the Xiongnu corpses
That is what I am saying.
With it hidden...
There was no sign of resistance, they were killed overwhelmingly.
Do you think it's the work of the same person?
It is well within reason.
I heard the from the few that did survive, that man's name is...
How is he connected to this war?
But Lin Xiangru and Zhao She have already departed from this world...
It's true that the former Three Great Divas are gone...
Southeast from where the Zhao Army headquarters was left
And the ones that were being surrounded were the Meng Wu and Long Guo Armies.
along with the vibrant battle history of those three being on-par us Six Great Generals of the State of Qin.
With the memories that the waving of that Great Diva Flag calls back,
They're coming from our position!
But that aide got led really astray!
Lord Zhao Zhuang!
I'm counting on you,
Charge!
The left army is the cornerstone of our defense
but unless we do, the enemy will not budge either.
The fortuitous desire I have will definitely come true one day.
a6Now's the only time.
they had all the less ability to stop their charge.
Hooray for General Wang Qi!
I understand everything you have said, general.
What?! Shit!
Are you listening?
I knew it, he has realized it! Thought
But Wang Qi had not realized it.
However, the endgame was taken a bit too lightly. Thought
Wang Qi!
With the results of the Zhao Army ambush we learned of through Yang Duan He
If I can predict it here in Xianyang,
then the title of Supreme Commander is rather unfitting.
Y-You have a point.
What?! Jie Shen!
They're currently changing formations near the headquarters!
so he went so far as to make Pang Nuan the Supreme Commander...?
Changwenjun.
Liao was a special person to Wang Qi somehow, is that not true?
I had always been certain you were dead,
The one-on-one fight between Supreme Commanders!
Foot soldiers, do not stop!
We will kill the one directing all units, Zhao Zhuang!
he got... serious!
This should not be all you are.
Lord Pang Nuan is currently engaged in a one-on-one battle with Wang Qi!
if this headquarters falls after that, we will not be able to adapt to the Qin Army's movements.
He cut him!
Lord Pang Nuan!
But now what's important is that Liao was an extremely important person to Wang Qi.
A one-on-one battle between the State of Qin Supreme Commander, Wang Qi,
our pride that lurks in the same landscape.
When I inquired, I learned that she had originally been a servant girl at Wang Qi's residence.
Who's an old man?!
So, she...
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... Flashback
This is my only... choice... Flashback
you are my treasure.
Is that you, old man? Come in.
I see!
He didn't say anything like "That's ridiculous!"
And I still am now.
Soon after she became a general, her strength was said to rival that of the Five Great Generals.
For the next war, the siege of Mayang,
We're finally at the last one, aren't we?
But on the night before the siege of Mayang, that man appeared.
That man that is like a disaster in the form of a human...
Pang Nuan. Even I do not know what it is that man wished to do.
He cut through soldiers at their campsite and attacked Liao.
Fire!
When people die, they turn to lumps of earth.
Yet why can I not cut him down?!
Wang Qi... Just what level of trap are you now entwined in?
But...
will not be defeated by a something such as this.
In other words, the Li Mu Army's speed
Xin, the boy that came from obscurity to become the general of a Hundred-Man Unit,
is the fate of a kingdom.
the many piled up meetings we've had
is a truth that interrupts the rain.
I've never seen an army like that before.
This is overkill.
All for just one enemy general...
is a symbol of that kingdom's military affairs.
Losing military might means that talented people will keep away from them.
that they had fallen for the enemy's strategy and defeat before their eyes.
It seems that I really will need for you to die here! Thought
So the Mystery Bird finally falls to earth...?
that is also proof recognized by all that Wang Qi is a hero whose name will go down in China's history.
And do you know why that is, Kaine?
As we're going into a new age, I cannot allow him to lose his life here.
Yes, sir!
He's heading toward General Wang Qi.
A horse! Qiang Lei!
That man, Wang Qi, that made all of China tremble! Thought
I cannot help but laugh! Thought
Lord!
I am announcing this to all soldiers of the Wang Qi Army that can hear!
Understand?!
Now the Wang Qi Army will show its true worth!
Just a little... Thought
Stop that man!
Pang Nuan, now the curtain falls! Thought
is the immense honor of being responsible for and controlling thousands and tens of thousands of lives.
We are the king and the sword that have been entrusted with the future of all of China!
Now a new light is born.
Isn't it obvious?
In a starry sky that disappeared faster than it ever has
Succession
Urgent report!
Bastard!
it would be the height of disgrace.
General Wang Qi!
This is quite good for someone of your standing, Youngster Qin.
The horse is riding on its own. I didn't do anything.
and...
How?
Now that that has been accomplished, there is no point in causing any more blood to be spilled.
This war ends here!
The battles in China will revolve around that man for a while, I expect...
Survive scenes of carnage together with everyone.
Because for the State of Qin, preventing invasion meant their goal had been accomplished.
The death of Wang Qi also reached the royal palace.
Of course. Because I did not tell it to him.
King Zhao entrusted me to make that decision.
I told you I was going to the war to find my place!
Yeah. I wasn't sure what was gonna happen when they tied us up.
But when the war ended, they let us go.
Maybe I got lucky.
It's totally the opposite!
Like hell I'd give it up that easily!
Uh oh!
Xin! We'll draw their attention.
Follow me!
So hold onto this for me until I can handle it freely.
Yes.
Season 2 starts in June 2013.
But they were then faced with the danger of being invaded by the neighboring State of Zhao,
Against him, the State of Zhao brought a man called a War God
whom also had a deep connection to Wang Qi as their Supreme General.
After losing such an utter symbol of its army, Qin lost morale
But at this moment, the people of Qin realized
that now was the time to rouse from this lethargy!
 A Shen is like a Wu, but a battalion of 10. 
The short-tempered and battle-loving Tian Yong.
The shining leader, Vice Captain, Yuan.
The medium that calls down gods of war, Vice Captain, Qiang Lei.
Oh, where are you?
L Buwei has gathered great men from every field to form his faction
What's going on?!
In the dozens of people I've served in the past,
Hey!
You were chosen because your ability was recognized!
You don't need to do anything.
Just staying there would be fine.
Thank you for coming all this way.
Such a difficult man...
Hold on a second!
Yan and...
He's coming in person...?
After that invasion last year, what in the world are they planning?
Li Mu!
G-Go on ahead!
He did something this reckless without even getting the king's permission? That L Buwei is unforgivable!
It's my first time back in so long and there's such a commotion going on!
With a certain idea in mind, L Buwei sent Chunpingjun a letter.
What is our king thinking?!
L Shi is well aware of the Zhao king's personality.
As I'll be if I don't go.
Besides, this will be a good opportunity to see Xiangyang and L Buwei with my own eyes.
I've heard that story before. Thought
That's reassuring.
That was the chancellor's order!
Where did that chancellor go to, anyhow?!
Just as I expect, everybody's nervous.
Be careful of what you say, Xin.
Probably.
Even I do not know the chancellor's true intentions.
At my signal, cut down Li Mu!
N... No way!
I don't know why, but the chancellor allowed the Zhao party to wear swords.
It's unmistakable. Thought
It would seem that the State of Zhao side is being overwhelmed by the chancellor's size. Thought
so I can't attest to how much it's changed.
What?!
For an ever-insatiable man like me, normally such a man would seem tiny,
But for a man of your caliber, I doubt this is an unforeseen circumstance.
I'm afraid I'll have to pose as a strategist for the State of Qin for this conversation.
But currently there are differences in the strengths of each of those states.
because we are quite surrounded on both sides by the Qin and Yan,
Do you not know where you are?
I am well aware of your feelings on the matter,
but this is not business for military men to get involved in.
Negotiating?!
Ah, I believe it was called... Hangao.
We have gotten intelligence that they started work on fortifying the region's defense, and are building a gigantic castle in its center which is now near completion. Thought
Just what I would expect from the chancellor.
It will be one or the other.
I will hand over Hangao to you.
Good! Then the Qin-Zhao Alliance is formed.
Who is this guy?
A dragon called the "era".
My desire in my unbreakable heart runs like a discontinuitous line.
a6I've made up my mind, right now it's the time to take the first step.
Your body is responding naturally to Muta's poison arrows.
Poisoned arrows?
Xin!
To not only dodge Muta's attacks, but to even wound him is quite surprising!
Square old man!
for what we'll be facing later, no matter how many lives you have, it won't be enough,
And is he including me when he says three heads?
Right now, Xin has sort of lost his edge...
Step back? Me? Thought
I know that!
But Xin's changed!
Well, if you're going that far...
Forgive me, Piao!
So I've recognized you as a soldier with backbone.
I haven't felt like this in a while.
The Shuda Hills. It was an excellent place to hide soldiers.
And so... the result of that is what I have given you.
I'm sorry it was so much that his face became unrecognizable.
I cannot imagine that someone of your caliber would assist us merely for Changwenjun's territory.
This belongs to that man, Muta.
A-As a Bessa Tribe warrior, I cannot let it end this way.
Prepare yourself.
Even though I said, "the escape plan will work perfectly"...
If I jump high enough, I'm sure I'll reach beyond the sky
Wh-What is all this?!
Well, I guess it makes sense. Thought
That is Lord L Buwei's seat, you see.
Don't you know our nations have formed an alliance?!
That idiot...
Shut up! I know that! Thought
They just do whatever they want without caring at all about the suffering of us civil officers.
How do you know who I am?
Is that so? You are that Xin...
I'll get bigger!
You idiot!
You are never elated about such obvious things, Lord Li Mu.
That's the extent of what an alliance is in these warring states.
How?
Xin?! Qiang Lei?!
but they're not bad people.
Oh, right. We don't have time, let's go.
Diao.
Zheng!
Ah, by the way, the power struggle between you and L Buwei's gotten worse, hasn't it?
It is performed at an ancestral shrine where generations of kings are enshrined
I will be recognized within the kingdom and without as the ruler of the State of Qin.
even ten years might not be enough.
No, five years is plenty!
We're not playing around here.
Now then, Xin, how are you faring?
In five more years, I will be 22.
Five years is plenty!
Man, we've had a bunch of victories in a row!
Hold it, you!
in a grand plan of attack from Xiangyang to capture the cluster of 20 castles in that area in one fell swoop.
If we get shoved into rearguard support or something, there'd be no way for us to gain any military achievements.
Of course.
Give it your all, Xin.
This became the first mid-sized battle of the war.
There's no way they can get out of this, is there, Xin?
Right!
Same.
I-It's no good.
What unit is that?!
They crossed the enemy's defensive camp and are attacking the back of their headquarters!
Don't fall behind the captain!
All right!
Whom is your unit affiliated with?!
Feixin Unit?
Is there something wrong with being peasant soldiers?!
but I find it disconcerting for you to consider yourselves to be of the same rank as us.
It is a big mistake for a group of ordinary foot soldiers such as yourselves
is that of ants.
Without that, there is no war.
Leave advanced positions, like independent reserve units, to us.
If you don't, I'll drag you down by force.
Right now, military commanders who are talented and young like me, are emerging from noble or warrior families.
Wang Ben?
What the hell was with that Wang Ben youngster?!
We're ants?
Fuck you!
But still... not only could we not refute him...
I-I'm sorry.
That's nothing but an excuse, ain't it?
Yeah.
When it comes down to it, we were just pressured by them and lowered our heads.
Like hell I'm just gonna sit quietly!
In order to outflank the Yufeng Unit, who are all riding on horses,
The Wei guys...
As we want to render big achievements, a large number of enemies gathering in one place will be convenient for us.
There seems to be something moving over there.
Sir!
Ang...
Looks like you're a tad bit too late, Yufeng Unit!
That fully-armored mounted unit is stronger than most of the 1000-Man units around here.
I don't really like Wang Ben.
Impeccable judgement!
In that line of thinking, we, the Yueha Unit, are quite suited to you, Lord Meng Tian.
We cannot go against Lord Bai Lao's orders.
I told you, you don't need to cry.
as well as those not aware of it at all.
No, Bi...
the power of his majesty's mother!
With the King Faction at a loss as to how to combat the L Shi Faction,
The harem is a third force?!
All of you, you may raise up your heads.
One so beautiful that she stole the heart of the former ruler, endangering the entire kingdom.
Women who are amateurs to government matters and get involved in the royal court always results in calamity.
so she has been silent in regards to the struggle between his highness and the L Buwei Faction.
Shi Shi, what did the queen dowager say?!
Nothing is written in it at all!
Either way, they are opponents we will not be able to avoid.
but they are the venomous fangs that make up the limbs of the queen dowager!
By simple addition, it would seem that they would expand our power,
but if we join with them, I doubt that we will truly unite and become a force that can fight the L Shi Faction!
U-Um...
You look at me quite a lot, don't you, Xiang?
N-No! It's nothing like that...
Yes, tell me.
Yes. She was always scolding me,
Yes.
You and the queen dowager could meet whenever you want, your majesty?
Just what happened between those two?
And... finally...
You are my son, indeed.
It seems things have gone just as you predicted, Zhao Gao.
Because of my lack of self-confidence, even though I am in the position of King,
Um, may I ask?
The age of the State of Qin's King Zhao, who was feared across China as the God of War.
An ambush?!
The State of Qin's Vice General!
I have no interest in a mere Vice General!
Approximately 400,000 soldiers surrendered.
My father... went by the name Zi Chu at the time.
You brat!
Hey, woman.
Yes. Usually, you're focused intently on reading your document, but tonight...
N-No! Y-Your Highness, that was not what I meant.
Who exactly was that person?
Do you think we could divulge it that easily?
We are merchants.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
The passing of his highness should only be known to one portion of the royal palace!
Hold on a minute.
I-If you know that much, it will make this quick.
It's him again, Zheng!
Damn brat! Background
The kid's pretty good!
They know that that boy is a hostage from Qin.
Since his dad escaped seven years ago,
It's just a matter of time before the King of the State of Zhao learns the King of the State of Qin died.
So there you have it.
Don't think badly of us.
In regards to this affair, we'll make sure not to divulge anything.
So long.
Lord Zheng, the time for you to return to the State of Qin has arrived.
You will be going home!
Meaning that the next king will be your father, and next in line for the throne is you, Lord Zheng!
Lord Zheng?!
That ain't gonna happen.
What're you going on about? Of course we didn't forget, Zi Xia.
We accept your job.
A dream...
Who?
What's wrong?!
What is this cargo?
Thanks, as always!
W-What was that just now?!
Lord Zheng?
What will you do in the State of Qin?
Again?!
So I'll make sure to have tea with you next ti...
I just bought this bow yesterday, so I figured no one would mind me shooting a sack of rice...
All the way from the gate, not only did he not yell, he hasn't made a sound. Thought
Is he unconscious? Or maybe... Thought
H-Here I go!
Who ever heard of a human who didn't twitch when an arrow was taken out of their arm? Thought
I really like your eyes when you look at the moon, Lord Zheng.
W-We made it by a hair's breadth...
We did it!
If we did this alone, it wouldn't have gone nearly as well.
Saved? Thought
Your father abandoned you to return to Qin seven years ago.
What's wrong, Lord Zheng?!
No decent human.
Geez, what the hell's going on?
Are you in your right mind?
Why in the world?
he was forced to endure the malice of Changping. Thought
Lord Zheng!
They're all fake!
They're still not back?!
Sorry for the wait.
If they did find out about is, then it won't be long... Thought
They've already caught up this much?!
That's too far! Thought
It can't be done. Thought
Shut up!
No way...!
Zi Xia!
None!
You don't belong anywhere.
You should just go to sleep.
A perilous road no one has ever walked before...
Now all that's left are the two merchants and Zheng!
Treat anything below his neck the same as those two!
I overestimated my own power... Thought
Now that Ya Men sacrificed himself, I don't feel like I can save anyone anymore. Thought
Hold on to the reins tightly.
You will need heavy concentration for this.
Zi Xia, what are you going to do?
We'll give everything we have to the very end.
Jiang Zhang!
Please, stay still!
No matter how small they are...
Thanks to you, I'm gonna make it home to Qin.
It looks like the moon has set.
Because of those difficult experiences, there is no other person like you who will become a king.
So... I'm sure...
You will... become a king greater than any other.
Xiang?
You'll get hurt if you get too worked up.
Gradually racking up achievements really was worth it.
Mounted Unit! Open a path!
Including the war two years ago with the State of Zhao.
The ones to render the biggest achievement in this war will be the Feixin Unit!
That's right!
The heads of the Three Great Princely Houses that support the power of the harem from the shadows
It got so late...
made it look even more beautiful and radiant than usual. Flashback
Like it was laughing at you. Flashback
But there was a person who told me that that wasn't so. Flashback
is to encourage you so you don't lose hope."Flashback
The queen dowager is his majesty's mother after all! Thought
There is no man more cursed than you.
And you said this to me, the woman that was supposed to be your fiance...
Jewel of Handan, Flashback
If you were a man who made excuses at this point,
Xiang! Wake up!
Xiang! Xiang!
Meanwhile, at the royal capital of Xiangyang,
That can't be true... Xiang...
I will explain later!
I'm going to save Xiang.
Xiang, try to hold on!
Yang, where have you...
They used every one of the best medicinal techniques of the era which they could on Xiang.
Why?
Please forgive me... for saying such things...
Please... find it in your heart... to forgive me...
The purpose of all these strange actions just to lure out L Buwei... Thought
You have just made a major misstep! Thought
The reserve armies would be sent in as reinforcements depending on the state of the battle
We've still got a long way to go.
What's with this 300-Man General?
I was amazed to hear that you seek to become the greatest general under the heavens!
Gramps is... is delighted to the bottom of his heart.
It's you?
They must be afraid of this force of 80,000!
Report! There are many casualties at the West and South walls!
Wh-What the hell is this?!
Okay, Feixin Unit, let's go!
This was because the generals that protected Gaolang Castle's four walls
The same day the battle against the State of Wei began.
With all due respect, Chancellor,
These are unforgivably foul rumors!
There was need to give everyone peace of mind.
Yes, leave it to me, sir!
The L Buwei camp thinks that these rumors will soon disappear,
Those people are...
Why are the heads of the Three Princely Houses here?!
Impossible... Thought
Isn't it obvious?
If he won't come to me,
But for that end, L Buwei has made a major mistake.
therefore it is not realistically possible to convict him.
Justice is on our side!
Leave it to us!
Yeah. Those arrows are something.
Hey!
Retreat! Retreat!
But in spite of this, Meng Ao showed no signs of panic.
Lord Ben, they've finally arrived.
What the hell... Wang Ben?!
The East Army has launched an attack.
But because they ended up being the impetus for victory,
What is it?!
the ladder units aren't following after them.
Yeah...
You... and you... and you...!
I'm glad we risked our lives to get here!
My king, who is this?
Your majesty, if I might have your permission,
Would you quit blabbering?!
Was there somebody here by that name?
What do you think you're doing?!
The king is calling you, Xin!
Not over there.
Muta's poison darts...?
I was sure that I would reunite with Lord Piao here, safe and sound...
could you do something like make me a general?
what he needed to do to get something...
It is unfortunate, but you are very mistaken.
The age where one can become a general merely by being born of a noble or warrior family has ended.
Don't get so down.
The rank of general isn't something even nobles or military families can gain easily.
Cut off that messenger's head.
Bi... You still have yet to grasp the true fearsomeness of Chancellor L.
All we can do is watch over the movements of L Shi and Jie Shi here, and wait for an opportune time to recover.
I've been thinking about that since I arrived here.
The chances are low, but we have no choice but to go meet with them,
To weave together my breaking heart
a6Voice of you
a6Voice of soul
I see... You all didn't know...
the story of the Majiu Soldiers.
Corner them!
Ah, I see. Thought
This is none of our business.
The problem lies rather with us, as the ones that crossed over first.
I'll make sure to pay you back someday.
Hey! Xin from the Feixin Unit!
Don't watch from all the way over there! Come up here!
Dragging out that huge thing!
Control yourself!
What's with those guys...?
Everyone, grab Lord Xin!
do you think I could just sit by and watch this happen?!
The enemy has already surrendered!
But it doesn't matter how many Wei bastards die!
This guy, I can't forgive! Thought
You idiot.
Guys like you that know nothing about the real world and try to act the hero
will never forgive such a person no matter what reason they give!
That's the way of fighting I've always had and always will!
What's with that guy?!
On the other hand, your exceptional acts of barbarity on people that had already surrendered
Even though we'd heard that the Thousand Man General is still alive,
Nothing. It's just that this ended in a surprisingly good result for us.
Wang Ben.
Forcibly quieting things was an easy task.
If he was beheaded, it would be his own fault.
I like that man they call Xin of the Feixin Unit.
anyone from the State of Wei is our enemy.
I've got some free time, so I could use someone to talk to for a bit!
And get me something to eat afterwards. I'm hungry.
But at this point, no one in the State of Qin had yet realized
Former member of the State of Zhao Three Great Devas,
It has been three years since you defected to my kingdom.
Their terrific fighting capability and military records roared throughout all of China.
Please General, allow me to take control of your soldiers and return to Handan for now.
Do you think you can do that?
I would not like to do it, but if I must...
We have a force of 50,000. General, you have 8,000.
The central unit led by General Lian Po has been destroyed! Destroyed!
I was raised on war, and made my name echo across the lands with war.
You guys, eh?
You seem quite happy nonetheless, eh?!
When we thought of seeing your gallant figure in battle once again,
Jie Zifang!
Shaddup! This siege tower belongs to all of us!
Lord Xin, the enemy's numbers are far higher than we anticipated!
Quit spacing out! Climb the siege tower on the double!
Yufeng Unit! Get in rank!
Go!
they're much stronger than those foot soldiers. Thought
Hey, you bastards! Do you have no pride?!
They've got tons of enemy soldiers ready and waiting in front of the castle gate!
One person fell!
So it's natural they'd be short on hands. Thought
Shut up!
But anyhow, that siege tower!
It broke?! For real?
Yeah. That old man from Yufeng was teary-eyed.
The war council!
Guo Bei?
X-Xin...
I've heard you used to be a servant.
Ever since I heard that, I've had something I wanted to tell you.
and was eventually taken in by my current family that originally didn't have any children.
When I heard about your circumstances, it reminded me of my younger self.
I was impressed by how you cut down that man Luan Tong at Guolong Castle.
Ah, h-hang on!
I took it upon myself to try to help you out,
And he's still pretty young, too.
I guess there are guys like that, too.
I, Guo Bei, was originally a servant as well.
Thousand-Man Generals?
Yes. A rat with considerably large fangs.
were all military commanders that form a central part of the Main Army's strength.
The Meng family will be much safer with your generation.
But do not fear!
And then, three days later...
is the picture of stringency.
There's no way an assassin could make an attack here. Thought
But the most 300 men can do is attack the edge of an encampment.
It would be utterly impossible to attack military commanders of a huge force of over 10,000.
Since you cannot judge people on anything but how they look, your majesty,
And through it, he crossed swords...
with Wang Qi.
General Luo Yuan was slain!
Let's leave the small fries.
Of course I'm strong!
It looks like despite his age, this boy has quite some experience. Thought
Who the hell are you?!
Th-Thirties?!
Those sorts of people are often beloved by the heavens.
Take those Thousand-Man Generals that just died.
What is it?
The incidents of the officers getting slain,
Hey, hey, you should remember the name of a general.
a person possessing the same level of power as one of the State of Qin's Six Great Generals.
But as he was a Great General of the State of Zhao,
Where are you going, Tian?
Oh, it's you, Father.
Oh? Didn't I tell you?
We're already playing into Lian Po's hands.
What is it?
The motive?
who always, always...
Or rather, he actually did make me cry quite a few times.
Mediocre?
Lian Po showed up... Thought
Y-Yes, we know...
My father is from the same generation as Lian Po, and ever since they were young novices,
Because of that, my father's path as a military general in the State of Qi was cut off for him.
When he is under heavy mental pressure, this man takes off his Great General armor,
And afterwards, he lays out on a quiet meadow and simply empties his mind.
Those higher-ups sure are stingy bastards, ain't they, Gramps?
Isn't that the special unit that Wang Qi named? Thought
And it's more serious the longer your service time.
To peak as an old man.
Doesn't that sound serious?
You said you've got another chance to fight the monster old geezer you lost to every time before.
You scared me there!
You know, you've got a point, Lord Captain.
You can do it, Gramps!
or we will be breaking the units up and adding them to other units!
What do you think, Qiang Lei?
Wait.
When considering your skill, Xin of the Feixin Unit,
the Feixin Unit will be disbanded.
Restart from Wu Chief?!
becoming a Thousand-Man Unit!
the State of Qin began its invasion of the neighboring State of Wei.
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin.
although it was temporary, Xin was finally promoted to being a Thousand-Man General.
Look at these new 700 men.
Uh, maybe.
a salute!
F-Former Guo Bei Unit?!
Lord Guo Bei has been telling us of the Feixin Unit's exploits for quite some time.
but we hope you will forgive us for holding thoughts of our departed Lord Guo Bei in a corner of our hearts.
What's your name?
Yes, sir.
General Lian Po!
A voice which gives weight to one's words is vital.
I had already hypothesized that Lian Po may emerge, as a precaution.
The Meng Ao Army has the fighting power to combat it.
If the State of Qin seriously intends to conquer China!
They know, but did not say anything... Thought
Xin... Thought
Aw, that's no fair.
It's totally fair!
Everyone would bow their heads even if I didn't say anything.
It sure feels like when you're leading a thousand men,
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, Thousand-Man General Xin!
What are those guys doing?
Just as General Meng Ao said,
This Vice General has taken five castles.
How did I completely overlook these two? Thought
Just what are they...? Thought
General Lian Po has just passed Shanyang Caslte!
Then, move the third unit two to the right.
We believe our armies will be assembled tomorrow as well, yes?
In other words, the battle starts tomorrow!
Get some booze!
Go for it!
Sheddep, so did you!
That's our Long Chuan.Thought
Okay. Ready...
Strength tests like these aren't just about a match of who's the brawniest. Thought
I really think that's because I still haven't avenged Big Sis Xiang.
I still vividly remember the pain from that day.
And I'm sure that's because... this place is...
This is an order to all units from General Tu Men!
By the decision of Ying Zheng, the king that wished to unite all of China,
Wang Qi told me this:
The State of Qin Army Supreme Commander, General Meng Ao, arrived at the location of the decisive battle, the Liuyin Plain.
Those are Grandfather's two Vice Generals.
When he was a thief, the State of Qin sent punitive forces to stop his tyranny countless times.
Then what about the other general, Wang Jian?
From what I've heard, that man's got a certain ambition.
He supposedly wants to become king.
The lord is not Supreme Commander?!
He was one of the men serving as Vice General to General Wu Qing
What in the world is going on here?
But more importantly,
Next, old man Xuan Feng!
Next, Bai Guixi!
Sir!
Lian Po... Thought
It says "I wish you good fortune in battle."
Let's push the fifth unit to the left.
Our army is pushing back!
And now they're on the attack!
General Tu Men!
The Ting Bi Unit was another sudden and specially organized unit like the Tai Yun Unit. Thought
The fourth unit is fighting a hard battle!
Call back the second unit and have them reinforce the fourth unit!
Yes, sir!
The ninth unit was caught by the enemy from the rear!
What?!
But more importantly, the right! Hurry and reorganize the right formation!
is because of what I did; assassinating noteworthy Thousand-Man Generals, forcing temporary ones to be formed.
Lord... Ben...
The enemy blocking their way is the legendary Great General, Lian Po.
'Course, even they're far less experienced than us.
If you're that intent on it, I won't think ill of you.
Oh well.
Just... what I want. Thought
Let's get going!
Chu Shui, is our mounted unit ready?
Let's go!
Second formation, sortie!
He missed!
Lord Ben!
Lord Lun Hu! The enemy's second formation is coming!
No need.
There was one trick behind the Feixin Unit's actions.
What you need to be attentive of are here and here.
B-But that would defeat the whole point of finally becoming a Thousand-Man-
Yeah!
A Thousand-Man Unit has other strengths.
Lord Lun Hu, the flow is shifting away!
That's odd. I didn't expect the State of Wei Army's dominance to be overturned this easily.
Okay, shall we go put an end to it?
A gong...? Thought
If you thought that the second formation that I, Lian Po, would send would be mere reinforcements,
That's likely the enemy's plan.
For the State of Wei Army's bow unit, if they had to rely on the sound of footsteps alone, it was impossible to locate them.
After all, once they're caught by that man's techniques, there's no hope for escape.
Especially those State of Qin soldiers. Why are they so flustered by a strategy of this level?
Dammit!
Chariots in this smoke... Thought
I'll be fine!
Chariots in this smoke... Thought
What do we do?! How do we...?! Thought
With the battlefield in chaos under the smokescreen, he placed soldiers across the battlefield in order to divide it into sections.
Qiang Lei, what's your plan?!
Tighten the guard!
is where the enemy headquarters is, ain't it?!
Whereas the enemy headquarters has numbers we cannot even estimate.
We are the Feixin Unit.
but rather deciding whether or not to get the first and second formations to retreat.
Send a signal to the sound units to change the bells!
Watch your backs! State of Wei soldiers are there!
I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when we jump out of the smoke!
right before our eyes.
Here we go, Feixin Unit!
If you understand that, stop trying to fight it and just use us as shields!
Big Brother!
Big Brother!
but on the other side of it, when that breaks down, you fall to the deepest despair,
Chu Shui!
And the smokescreen was blown to just behind Xin and the others.
Wang Ben...
How can this be?! We never got a signal that they would be appearing!
Just like the Yufeng Unit did, we used the corpses as footholds to get over the traps.
Okay! We can still do this! Thought
Is screwing up the sound signals working?!
Listen closely, Feixin Unit!
I'm sure the captain will return having defeated the enemy general!
I told you, didn't I?
The enemy general is right in front of us!
Yes, sir!
I might die an early death.
Lord Xuan Feng!
Do you know how many died on our side?!
In order to prevent loss of its morale,
My comrades in arms, my brothers...
Report!
his range is twice that of a layman. Thought
Normally, the enemy would just be crushed to death and become Jiang Yan's prey, but... Thought
that made Wang Qi call you "undoubtedly of the same class as the Six Great Generals". Thought
has once again attacked the enemy's supply unit!
My humblest apologies.
Boss, we've got a big catch today, too!
Open them for me.
Huan Ji the Beheader. Thought
Is this our lord's orders?
But if this left army is slow going, it will resonate with the entire battle.
He wants us to end things quickly and move on to the next move.
But for you, someone whose skill lies in frontal attacks,
Tell those guys about this place.
And it looks like where they're going is...
Also, I've got a report from some spies
B-But Huan Ji's headquarters entered the mountains at the start of the war.
They're in position to resist us. Thought
I will not hold back. Thought
A report for Lord Xuan Feng!
he will not make it past Jie Zifang!
Lord Xin! Can you hear that?!
I let you die a boring death... Thought
but you certainly have talent, I suppose.
I wouldn't mind taking you on as a disciple, Huan Ji.
We did it!
General Huan Ji's awesome!
What?!
Could you be a little more detailed about it?
General Lun Hu, I understand how you feel, but we really must begin the war council.
Hey, now.
You've heard about how Xuan Feng was slain, Wang Ben?
Including how to overcome those walls, we need to think about what we're going to do from here.
This is where the enemy Supreme Commander, Bai Guixi...
and it seems he lost half of his soldiers.
But having lost track of Huan Ji, Jie Zifang has to always be on his guard.
Xuan Feng, a long-time officer under Lian Po,
apparently was skilled enough to command the entire State of Zhao Army.
He also boasts incredible ability to break through opposition.
I see...
Hold on a second!
Tomorrow, we have the Yuehua Unit, the Yufeng Unit, and the Feixin Unit attack in a group
Yuehua Unit!
I've got something I need to talk to you about.
The battle will flow to the end of today. Thought
General Tu Men! We have a situation!
What?!
The Yuehua Unit?!
and will be leaving their post, leaving 200 soldiers behind!
the situation has majorly changed.
Because he's my dear Grandfather that's always looking after this wandering, carefree grandson of his.
Hold on a second. Then that means you're just going to take down Lun Hu yourself, doesn't it?! Flashback
Here we go, everyone!
Now!
Someone lend him a shoulder.
Those who cannot keep up can descend the mountain and wait at Duke Mu's summer retreat!
A separate country called Jin?
Jin invaded our country.
our Qin soldiers lost strength,
They had incurred a debt towards Duke Mu.
The debt of the horse and the liquor.
Even if they did protect Duke Mu's summer retreat,
Do you?
What?
Do not misunderstand.
You want me to go down the mountain, too?
Aren't I your sword?
I don't need a sword for a discussion.
Isn't that right, Teng?
He's... gonna get killed.
He's definitely gonna get killed.
What the hell are you doing, bastard?!
We must call them back immediately!
No, wait.
Father, about Meng Tian, Flashback
is he still halted as a 300-Man General? Flashback
He may be a bit of a gentle child,
But... Thought
Wha-?!
Correct?!
But of course, he cannot break through a few hundred or a few thousand enemies on his own.
Say we're going to attack them together,
It looks like you've really resolved yourself this time, Meng Tian. Thought
This is all for the sake of defeating Lun Hu!
But the Lun Hu soldiers have been diminished just as much.
We're gonna run through that opening!
We can do it! We might make it through!
These are Lun Hu's final soldiers that form a shield around him.
C-Captain, behind us!
Why did you come back?!
Are you going to head back towards Lord Xin?!
No. It wouldn't be a good plan to bring the Lun Hu soldiers to where Xin is.
you guys don't seem to have a firm grasp of your opponent's strength.
Woah there!
Woah, there.
Fuck off, you bastard! Thought
Lord Lun Hu!
But just to let you know, that guy is part of Wang Qi's family.
But history's strongest Great General? That's quite a claim.
Yer damn right!
After I slay you, I'm gonna kill Lian Po while I'm at it!
Because both your lives are going to end today.
Front line, switch!
and change the state of battles on their own.
As for Lun Hu, I'd say he's the latter.
bet your ass I will!
Even just attacking normally, we can fend off three times our number.
Well deduced, Lord Bi.
Urgent report! Urgent report!
What?!
There's always a heavy air surrounding this man... Thought
I see you as a particularly bright tactician.
Bi!
It is all for the sake of victory.
I am a member of the Wang Clan!
Hurry, Xin... Thought
Captain!
We're the ones watching over the generals' fight!
Do you want to slap mud on our lords faces?!
he's started to change?! Thought
I know, I know!
Retreat formation!
Feixin Unit, come with us!
We can do it.
Don't let them get away!
The headquarters is in disorder as well.
There's no need for that.
Yes, sir.
Me? A 5,000-Man General?! Thought
once a chance to grab victory seems likely, that force can descend the mountains and take down the enemy. Thought
5,000 men led by me... Thought
All units, descend the mountains and take down the enemy general, Jiang Yan!
Or perhaps we should wait for them to come and defeat them when they try to attack?
What do you say, Lord Jiang Yan?
Enemies! The Wei guys are up on the cliffs!
He sent a signal with his arrow to coordinate with units fighting in other areas? Thought
No!
We can't, Lord Bi!
We'll gather allies, regroup, and find an opening to charge through no matter what it takes!
This is... one of the Lian Po Four Heavenly Kings... Jiang Yan?! Thought
I will give you one means of escape.
And Jiang Yan... you will become my aide.
My country will require men that are powerful in battle like you.
What is General Wang Jian saying? Thought
But... Thought
But even if you had your army hidden, there is no way you could have formed an army like that and kept it secret from us!
We knew the distribution of the State of Qin Army as well as our own as well as all of their movements.
No, we were not aware of everything.
So the headquarters split apart without us knowing?
it was necessary for him to hide an army here beforehand.
Those of the State of Qin and of the State of Wei,
That vigor the State of Wei Soldiers have...
The only part of the cliffs we lost is that area that Lian Po took. Thought
is because even at a high estimate, his army probably only numbers 1,000! Thought
I am not interested in battles except for those I am certain to win.
I do not understand.
Which would you say was the most heated?
And having a similar fighting style
Urgent report! Urgent report!
We are not prepared to siege it. Thought
What're those guys doing?
It became a melee so chaotic that a small unit that left its formation would not be able to make it back.
Captain!
He's very warped. Thought
There is no need to deny it. Thought
Yes, sir!
It's strange, but when you get to be my age, you figure out a few things.
Normally, yes.
And you dirty louts, get outside!
The pain...
A secret medicine handed down through my clan's village.
Thanks.
Was he perhaps really strong?
With that secret medicine you gave me, I'll be back to normal in one night.
Not that convenient, eh?
Instead of worrying about that, think about tomorrow.
Qiang Lei!
Now for a fresh start!
Unless they can crush the State of Wei Army that has been sent to defend it,
I thought so.
Young generals take on this relentless battlefield in hopes of rendering great military achievements.
Yeah, makes sense.
We've got some thick clouds today.
All three as reserve units ready at their positions.
I will fill in my lost soldiers with Jie Zifang's. Thought
Today, our target is the head of Supreme Commander Meng Ao, located at the back of the enemy central army.
Kill the State of Qin dogs!
Lun Hu seems to be on the right!
Do you think Lun Hu could be on the right?!
Today, Lun Hu is going to attack seriously.
The right-wing enemy is turning in... the opposite direction?! Thought
Yes, sir!
With the two vortexes spinning in opposite directions, Thought
Oh no. The target of that wheel movement is... Thought
Lord Meng Tian!
Okay, let's go, you bastards! Thought
Just to be safe, leave 200 here before you go!
Let's go, you bastards!
I'm surprised.
This guy, with one hand, he's... Thought
Lun Hu will use his deft horse-riding skills to turn that side away from him. Thought
You'd best not make the mistake of thinking I'll be weaker today than I was yesterday.
I've got tons of experience of only being able to fight with one hand.
Not that I wanna actually fight, though.
I don't mind fighting empty handed!
Yes, sir!
Which one will surpass their limits and continue on their path?
Hurry and get down here!
But I'm actually quite happy with this. Thought
Hurry!
is to establish a map of the entire war and lead their army to victory.
The map of this war I drew... Thought
And what's tilted the state of war above all is... Thought
I've pierced the back of your headquarters. Thought
Send all of the headquarter's armies to the rear.
The bow unit will act as usual.
Yes, sir!
Okay, here we go, Meng Ao. Thought
That fool! We've got you now, Lian Po!
My lord, what in the world is this?!
The enemy is short-handed over here!
N-No, go back!
I'm astonished!
That he was coming?
As a military commander, Lian Po has many faces.
So say he's fighting defensively,
L-Lord Li Mu?
I think General Lian Po may be an exception,
If the general remembers Lian Po,
It's impossible to follow the correct route in this complicated maze from memory!
Look!
Finally... coming, are you? Thought
and that you could unerringly put it into practice. Thought
And for that reason... Thought
that I will use your cleverness against you! Thought
and their foot soldiers. Thought
Dammit...
These two's heated emotions are now making sparks fly.
If you fall here, the entire State of Qin Army will collapse.
You bastaaard!
If you'd continued as you were, this battle would have been over quickly.
No fuckin' problem!
Fire!
We will end this war in one final push!
We can't! We can't even move right now! All we can do is try to shield ourselves from the arrows!
Then we'll just keep shooting at anything that moves, and that will end it!
Fire, fire!
Wasn't he just caught in that trap and getting pelted with arrows?
But in order to remake the paths to lead enemies into traps after they entered the maze
A matter of time?
Yeah, I get it. Thought
For Lord Xin, a man with the goal of becoming the greatest general under the heavens,
We cannot lose this! Thought
With vengeance for Gui Bei right in front of him, perhaps it was too difficult for him to curb his impulse.
and aimed towards Lun Hu!
For that fleeting instant, his attention was drawn away.
Captain!
In the State of Qin and the State of Wei's fierce battle, Xin and Lun Hu have faced off once again.
These two's heated emotions are now making sparks fly.
There are some child survivors Flashback
Give them some food and water. Flashback
has me, the sword that the heavens guided to him.
That's why I...
Even you are putting your life on the line to fight as Lian Po's sword, right?!
He beat Lun Hu!
I can't see any sign of people in the area where we left Vice Captain Qiang Lei and the others.
Can you seriously not see them anywhere?!
What... is that...? Thought
You idiot, what do you think you're saying?!
B-But...
You call yourself a member of the Feixin Unit?!
I'm sorry, Big Sis Xiang. Thought
Captain!
Qiang Lei...
but I'll make sure I get my revenge. Flashback
Qiang Lei!
Everyone around here is huge.
Xin.
How can that... Thought
She's actually really "empty".
She's been thinking about things besides revenge... about what she wants to do after...
And that's the Feixin Unit.
I'm not gonna ask you guys to pretend you didn't notice this...
Thanks, Old Man Lu Yan.
Can you stand?
Mr. Yuan, how is the enemy army looking?
I suppose due to the fact that Lun Hu was not purely a State of Wei general
their morale raised from being invaded won't easily be broken.
Sorry, Mr. Yuan, could I leave this place to you?
Yeah.
The intense battle has reached its endgame and Meng Ao has finally faced off against Lian Po.
Ow...
Mr. Yuan, how is the enemy army looking?
Yes, sir. They've lost morale after having heard of Lun Hu's death,
Stop them here at any cost!
Just one more push, Yufeng Unit! Now is the time to stand firm!
Let's hurry!
Th-The lord! Protect the lord!
What in the world are you...
But just what is that skittish Meng Ao...
He managed to keep it shallow? Thought
What exactly did you think you could do with skill like that, Meng Ao?
And that I should be happy I've got a chance to make a comeback after all this time.
Pretty heavy, wasn't it?
Xin! If you're feeling weak, then rest!
It's got to be Lian Po... Thought
What the hell... happened?
The one suffering wounds overwhelmingly is Lord Meng Ao.
Lian Po. Have you really not realized it yourself?
your flame went out as well!
General!
grasped the flesh and blood of millions of soldiers
Yeah, just like General Wang Qi, I can definitely feel an insane "pressure" just from him standing there. Thought
And while I did actually oppose Wang Jian,
means that that was not seriously what you were seeking.
What the hell is the passage of eras?!
Youngster, you're 10 years too early.
That's...
You slew Lun Hu?!
Run, now!
What are you guards doing?!
But that absolutely...
Not convinced?
I guess you can't bear it.
This is no longer a one-on-one fight!
Wait, Lian Po!
That boy was present at Wang Qi's end
For old time's sake, let's duke it out to the end.
General Meng Ao.
That can't be! Those are dangerous sheer cliffs!
Their numbers aren't that big!
Who is that bastard?
Could it be?
Boss!
Getting cold feet?!
A lot of my subordinates are waiting for you on the other side!
Ridiculous.
Xin!
We've lost.
What sorta place do you think the Mountain King's country is?
And even if they call it a country,
Th-This is... insane...!
All right! Now's my time to shine!
Wh-What's with you guys?!
Y-You're kidding, right?
Can you really do that?
Tajif the Warrior?
King of Qin, Ying Zheng?
It would seem things will not be meeting your expectations.
So we should just forgive the murders of our countrymen?
What do you mean?
King of Qin... Take a good look around you.
That's the polar opposite of the path of preserving life, isn't it?
The throne is nothing but the first step on my path.
China...?
the defensive walls of the Mountain Countries increase in number and strength.
And as they do, I sense the narrowness of the countries.
There is no need for any other questions.
So foolish!
Kay?
We're doomed...
Shut up about your "regret"!
If you really care about the dead,
as you have seen, I am currently a powerless, weak king.
We are violent!
Everyone, listen closely!
I gaze at the fragments of a dream No more crying
a6Voice of soul
If you take a look at the battlefield as a whole...
With the battle in this state, the appearance of an army of 10,000, fully able to fight, would be a decisive blow.
And then I won't be able to reorganize our armies.
What?!
Sir?
The central army which was the foundation of the State of Wei's main force...
Naw, not bad, kid.
So no matter how you bastards rampage across this land,
But there is actually one way to surpass us.
There's no way a king that will make a bid for supremacy like that, even surpassing the legendary King Wu, could emerge...
No, it's not impossible, Meng Tian.
H-Hey, Lun Hu's sword!
My feelings of taking you down for the sake of the State of Wei were not false.
Thanks to me!
Xin, is that you?
X-Xin! What's wrong?!
Oh. That thief did, eh?
You were sleeping for a really long time, are you okay?!
She really is cute! Thought
Hey, you bastards, don't give Qiang Lei those weird looks!
Hey man, your face is bright red!
The war over Shanyang ended with the State of Qin Army's victory
According to historical records,
Well, I suppose wearing armor is allowed, so perhaps that would be acceptable.
You're in the back! Step back!
Is Wang Ben here, too?
General Meng Ao!
The general's court rank will increase by one,
The Vice General that slew an enemy staff officer and the enemy Supreme Commander, General Huan Ji!
What sorta face has he got? Thought
Sheddep! That was all on purpose!
H-Hey!
The uniting of China. Flashback
I don't know much about kingdoms.
Of course, it hit home for me, knowing how huge it is to do that sorta thing.
Lord Meng Tian.
Thanks for all the hard work. How'd the battle turn out?
Qiang Lei hasn't rendered all of the achievements we got up to this point alone.
H-Have you really been fighting with this strategy?
Y-Yeah.
What about the Guobei Unit?
Uh, I am being serious, though.
Having said that, there doesn't seem to be any way to deal with it within the unit.
But the fact that you haven't had all that many losses is only because you haven't come up against any strong enemies!
B-But...
Once you're a Thousand-Man Unit, you cannot fight on momentum alone!
Let's go greet them.
I thought you'd be surprised.
And now, Xin has been driven to the point of being in danger of losing his title of Thousand-Man General.
Or so he thought...
But I guess it's not really the time for saying stuff like that.
Th-Then...
I came here with the resolve not to go back to Xianyang. Thought
What that man said isn't wrong.
Emergency report! Emergency report!
Yes, sir!
And...
Ah, nothing.
Well either way, you're pretty cute.
The Tian You Unit is fighting a hard battle!
What?!
They are requesting backup!
What do ya mean?!
The Pei Lang, Chong Yuan, and Tian You units are breaking down!
If we don't hurry, with those small units separated, they'll be utterly wiped out!
Disappeared?
Meanwhile...
Slaughter them all!
We're going to remake the headquarters on the other side of these hills!
I'm not trying to cover for her,
At the school, the only one that's able to compete with her in Strategic Go is me.
That Xin's pretty good once in a while.
It's not just you guys.
My unit, too.
There are many strategist apprentices that are swallowed by that and crushed because they can't manage to do anything.
This is definitely the first time I've felt this suffocated. Thought
Got it!
Here we go!
This is the air of a battlefield, huh? Thought
It's all right!
They can't see from over there,
W-What?!
I suppose I underestimated them. Thought
The narrow path battles are over!
A-Already?!
And one strategy you can be almost sure to find in the endgame is forcing one's way through.
A four-layer defensive fomration!
Th-The captain and the others are being swallowed!
Th-The enemy's at our feet!
Stones or whatever you can get your hands on, throw something down there!
Sheddep!
We must not let the captain, Xin, escape!
Good.
Behind me?! Thought
I never guessed she'd use me as a decoy!
W-What?!
Xin...
Xin...
When I give instructions on the battlefield
Close to 100 of our men died in that battle.
And now I'm thinking how many hundreds I'm going to let die after this...
That's why the weight on our backs gets a lot heavier when we win.
If you came here without knowing about that sorta pain,
Here comes Xin!
Who is this girl?
Are you Lord Xin's little sister?
they are truly strong.
Man, they're slow!
No, they're not!
Two of L Shi's Four Pillars are here, at Shanyang?
Along with that, we will be migrating 10,000 people of the State of Qin here.
That is all.
In this era, the kingdoms constantly take land from one another.
indicated a strong will not to let go of this land.
In other words, the Shi Huang Year 5 Shanyang Dongjun Declaration
No.
Like I told you, I understand how you feel, but
What?!
Just like at Mayang, the Great General is Pang Nuan.
There are over 100,000 soldiers.
Pang Nuan... Thought
Just like how the State of Qin attacked the State of Wei,
Yeah.
Not even that!
He saw through Li Mu's strategy and launched a counterattack.
I don't think it'll be soon...
In terms of land area, Chu is as big as six other states.
If they're that strong, then why don't they attack us?
Good morning.
3 months have passed since the border patrol of Chu began.
and the Feixin Unit is now targeting the castle to the far East, Dongjin.
This isn't good.
Increase search for the enemy!
Watch out for the thicket on the left!
Drink this, slowly.
and over 500 years, it was reduced to 7 large kingdoms.
will be a double-edged sword.
What? Upset I made moves without telling you?
but by wielding the power of his faction, L Buwei was able to take the position for himself.
With the power of the harem, it is no longer possible for us to resist the L Buwei camp.
But we no longer have any...
Th-This is...
Open the door.
and in exchange free everyone of the Chengjiao Faction confined to this castle.
But L Buwei's confidants, Chanpingjun and Li Si are going to take those...
This time, we will seize power as well!
Yes...
Everyone collapsed around here are children.
Mother!
Once we've got that gate open, all that's left is to finish off the lot inside.
So he's the general, huh?
Xin, be careful!
His skill at mounted battle has gotten remarkably better!
Han Army soldiers!
Mother!
Why is that?
And because of that, the spies sent on secret missions from the major figures of those kingdoms
and learned of Xu by coincidence.
Forgive me for being able to offer nothing more to express my gratitude for saving our country.
I don't think we will have any attacks for some time.
And if necessary, we can request help from the three kingdoms.
Those are honorable wounds!
This sure is a precise map...
Well, not like I'll know who he is by sight, though...
Captain, we'll be seen.
What's that Li Mu bastard doing at a place like this?! Thought
Lord Cai Ze...
Who are those two elderly men?
Everyone that was released with me that day was part of the royal family. Thought
Well done, my king.
You've truly gotten bigger, haven't you? Thought
Well quite a bit happened to us.
and make the name of the Feixin Unit echo throughout all of China!
They're different... Thought
In the few years since the war against Wei under Duke Biao,
Ah, I'm sorry!
Xin! You did it!
Yeah. You can make medicine out of this.
Xin, let me touch it!
You're so mean, Xin!
It hurts! Hurry, somebody get it off!
I know, Lusui. Thought
Come with me for a minute, Xin.
Yes?!
What's wrong?
Is that what it was, Xiang?
L Buwei... You are nothing more than an insect that's infested this country.Thought
Therefore, I must mercilessly eliminate all those that block my path. Thought
Now that's a laugh.
You know.
Captain, we'll be seen.
Honestly, you really are a troublesome person, aren't you?
Yes. You look quite different.
Li Mu!
Hm, what shall we do?
Well then...
Wh-What?!
Lord Li Mu!
There's an interference.
Xin!
So you're growing as well, are you?
Then what happened?
I can see how you are able to carry the role of being the brains of the Feixin Unit.
With Wang Qi's death and General Meng Ao being injured and effectively retiring after that last war,
One way or another, we're going to crush every one of the other states.
Truly a deed that would go down in legends.
So no matter what kind of storm arrives, we'll overcome it!
Our goal is the capital of the State of Qin, Xianyang!
This has gotten pretty amazing!
Xin!
Heavens!
Why do we let these cowardly traitors do as they please?!
I know, right?
Farewell.
Also, the king is now but a meager existence.
Wh-What's that?
This guy's hungry!
Well, I guess I'm just...
Hey, uh...
Me, too!
Could you be lovestruck?
As Xin says, momentum is one of the elements needed to win a battle.
and their focus has changed from you, my king, to L Buwei.
It's a mask Xin made!
For you, that's a great job.
I made one for you, Zheng.
Our enemy is L Buwei.
There's no bridge.
Lord Ying Zheng?!
I thought it was an excuse not to see me. Thought
If I jump high enough, I'm sure I'll reach beyond the sky
Yes.
And a storm of violent wars erupted for 500 years...
Don't piss yourself, moron!
Hey, Zheng, are we gonna go attack that thing?
In other words, Xianyang itself is one giant castle.
Of course...?
We have only one goal;
Do not disappoint me, Shi Shi.
Yes, my lord.
But when they called out for soldiers, they only gathered 80,000.
Now, let's go!
Their number?
He then returned to the crowd.
It's all right. They're sure to take the bait.
That'd be nice...
they'll be a force to be reckoned with!
After having cut all ties with us for all these years, why would they suddenly revive the alliance?!
The State of Qin welcomes you.
It is to form an alliance.
If you are displeased with my decision, I beg your forgiveness...
Using monkeys to fight a fox... is that right?
Sitting on the throne as the king of the State of Qin is sufficient.
Things are going well so far.
But...
the idea that we would have needed to break down all of these castle walls gives me the chills.
There are a lotta guys dressed in all black.
What're plicofficers?
People who apprehend criminals.
So they must firmly prevent any disparaging rumors from leaking from the royal palace.
I see.
But even so, one thing bothers me... Thought
Like when you used an ox in place of a horse for training.
Me, die?
You fool!
Though just a little, I have been personally trading with a portion of the Mountain People.
Changwenjun! Bring forward the ten people who have knowledge of the inside of the royal palace.
In that case, the external enemy army will gather here.
Unless we settle this inside the royal palace, we have no chance of victory.
It's too late now.
Do you have any idea what's about to happen?!
If we lose in there, even if we're outside, we're all gonna get killed.
So there are no mistakes in any such unlikely case,
we have stationed many guards there.
Everyone, lay down your arms!
What is going on...?!
Kill! Kill them!
Kill them all!
Unless we cross over that wall, we'll never have victory!
That's reckless! Come back, Xin!
He-He made it!
I hit him.
Don't stop, Xin!
Yes.
an armored fortress if you will.
Venus Gate's current majority stockholder is a religious cult thought to have been disbanded.
to be effective against ACIS.
towards the day a cure is discovered.
the commencement of their cold sleep center operation will coincide with their next course of action.
but they were not happy.
He invited not only his relatives...
Look! Look, Kasumi!
That's not what...
The thirteen witches had special powers.
In a moment, representatives from our company will come to guide you.
Please feel free to use any of the facilities.
Come on.
I'm not sure if I should say this...
Then if I may introduce to you...
Our state of the art master control system...
ALICE records your individual data, as well as biological data such as genetic information.
What might that be?
Do you dream during cold sleep?
NO!
Kasumi.
I'll be waiting for you, always.
Leave everything in the custody of the center.
Your possessions will be returned once you exit cold sleep.
Please go ahead.
Hello, my name is ALICE.
Good night.
They found the cure!
Hey! Hey!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry!
Calm down! Just calm down!
Everyone calm down!
He's talking about a game... I guess.
Exactly.
Contacting someone comes first.
What do you think you're doing?!
Yes, Mother.
And we... can no longer return to the capsules.
We can't.
But!
What happened to her?
So...
What?
You sure about that?
That was seriously reckless.
It's not coming after us?
This thing had Medusa?
How could that be?
What indeed...
You're good at this.
Stop it.
But I really wish I could have switched out a party member...
That look... I hate how you look at me!
I won't make this a game anymore.
Do you, amigo?!
They had metal detectors. I saw a lot of people get caught.
Don't move!
Weren't you the ones who just up and followed me?
Four blocks up ahead, there's a central shaft.
Got that?!
Why?
I've met you before.
So she's alive...
So Shizuku... Where did Shizuku go?
Damn.
Hey, you can't be serious.
Damn it!
Why?!
Kasumi!
The two of us are the only family we have left in the world now.
I never... I never thought it'd turn out like this.
I made it so I could access the memory backups from anywhere for times like this.
Of course, it'd be a lie to say I didn't have the slightest bit of ambition.
That's what that fiend took advantage of.
I'm leaving this to you.
Climb.
Do you want one, too?
Right before he died, he told me to tell the world about Venus Gate's true nature.
How could that be...
It's not. This situation is irregular.
You could call it an experiment done to turn dreams into reality.
There must have been a reason.
This happened eight years ago.
The unknown disease, the girl, and the odd creature had an intertwined relationship.
But why? This was a gift worthy of the Heavens!
she was the second compatible user I had been searching for.
That's right.
Idiot!
BOY!
My purpose is to protect the lives of the candidates.
At this rate...
You're really an idiot, Kasumi.
Sorry.
Tim.
You can just call me Auntie.
Miracles don't happen without wishes.
We have orders to bring her to the top level lab.
Oh no, the castle's...
No, that's not where we're headed.
I've decided to dedicate the life I have left to this child.
Wings?
Did Sleeping Beauty even want to wake up?
She'd never age, and if she wanted to see the Prince,
All the more reason, too, if your circumstances are overwhelming.
I suppose you're right about real a princes.
Auntie. Auntie!
Where's Tim?
Level 0 is like one of those black boxes.
And I'm the only one who can stop her.
That's the spirit. Let's go.
You're correct on both accounts. Your role ends here.
3...
Between these extremes sits a delicate balance.
Kasumi's existence is the greatest destabilizing factor to the S-class candidate. meaning Shizuku's stability depends on Kasumi's welfare
Then what's making me see Laura?
Your little sister?
Kasumi!
In your current state, you cannot use physical means to destroy me.
That's why I'll use my knowledge of Medusa.
I really can't...
I can't accept any of this.
3...
7...
Mr. Marco!
You're the alternate that Shizuku's mind created, aren't you?
You just don't.
Give up on me.
Please, just stop.
Stop!
Shizuku!
Please!
Please open your eyes!
Kasumi?
Why!
That's not true; I became stronger because you were there with me.
I...
My wish went out of control.
Once Sleeping Beauty wakes up, the world has no choice but to change.
Mr. Marco?
Thank you, Mr. Marco.
Spring.
i1We're time travelers sent from the present,
i1which is forever repeating the same day in order to prevent mankind's extinction.
i1We studied time travel at school, took evaluation tests,
i1The difference is whether the flesh is dead or alive.
i1So in a sense,
i1doesn't it cross time?
It'll be a bit hard to feel the distance next time...
We can't even be sure we're really 6,000 years in the future.
Speaking of which, what time is it supposed to be, Timekeeper?
No idea.
Someone was definitely living here.
Well then, we'll hold down the fort here.
I guess plan B would be to find a convenience store.
Capture.
What did you even bring this for, anyway?
By the way, where did Ichimiya and Hongou go?
Your legs.
Saving humanity through reproduction is out of the question too.
Guess that means God doesn't expect us to do that.
They had more people around.
Buildings would rise from the ground like trees, and...
Agreed!
What are you doing?
Bark.
Where did the top go?!
You've got a point...
Hm, maybe we don't look like prey?
Well, not that I care about being dead or alive.
It's been a while, Sakyouyama.
What's up?
He told me he'd bury a letter.
You know, we're not very futuristic.
Did someone make it travel through time?
It's to save the future. Not TSing the note because its read aloud and holy shit her handwriting is bad.
i1even though he was so silent the night before we leapt.
i1That's why I still carry this cell phone.
Hi, everyone. It's been a while.
What happened to it?
Neither am I.
It's been so long.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an answer besides "because I want to."
Hi... or, not!
If you ask someone to meet you, choose a better place!
Yes, Hermes.
I don't know. I just transport bricks.
We should be grateful.
Please listen to what I have to say.
It's not about something else...
Why does everyone in this country build the tower?
Why, you ask?
They're pushing the limits by continuing its construction at this height.
There you are.
So, where are we going next?
Doko kara kita doko made yuku
I can stop anytime I want.
That make sense?
Frankly, I don't really get it.
Looks like someone's there.
Are you from the country up ahead?
I could get there before you and sell it all off.
but I've heard it's a very polite country.
you can kill people.
That's why I up and left.
No.
The great Regel is a famous serial killer
He must get all kinds of respect.
You really won't help me carry anything?
Think that's it?
Mentally prepared?
everyone here is free to kill anyone for any reason without being criminalized.
The food's good, too.
That's what makes it strange.
or dogs just walking around with human hands in their mouths.
Oh, I've never had a robber come in here.
Well, when, indeed?
Kino's Journey
We do it twice a week.
At our age, you have to make exercise a habit.
The tea here is always so good.
I think a person like you would be well suited for our country.
All right. Just make sure you patch the holes later.
You heard him.
That's my
Damn it! Ow!
That's right.
Exactly.
and those who are trying to kill another
Good afternoon.
A traveler I met long ago said
Motorrads are happiest when they're running.
You could have made a living at Master's place, too.
no, it's rather poorly received among travelers.
Really?
And, "I hope that country disappears sooner rather than later."
That's exactly why I'm going.
Is there a hotel with a shower that's not too expensive in this area?
How about it?
It's a good name.
What does it mean?
It's the name of a flower.
A pretty pink flower that blooms in spring.
Oh?
This is my father and my mother,
Very good.
Kino, please let me show you around our country.
Let me see.
No country will take our people in!
Come on, come on.
Wait, hold on. Excuse me!
That's right!
I can't walk anymore!
You're right! Looking closely, there are animals here, too!
It looks delicious.
Thank you very much.
Hermes, you awake?
Once I eat breakfast, we're going shopping.
It was quite a long time ago.
I know you can.
That's lovely, too.
Kino's Journey
We want...
Five children!
Here you go.
Is it that shocking?
I made a lot of wonderful memories.
You're welcome.
What?
It's a corruption.
A pyroclastic flow's close to 1,000 degrees Celsius.
We made our choice
Then, with just three days left, you arrived.
But last night, she told us she wanted to inherit the inn.
So we'll be taking her with us.
Go ahead.
What a nice country that was.
Country of Adults.
I was eleven.
I was often teased that way.
Good afternoon.
Is there a hotel in this city?
A cheap one with a shower would be nice.
My family runs one.
Repairing this motorrad.
So once this guy comes to, I'll need to ask him what he thinks about it.
What do you mean?
Yeah, that's right.
They're not fun.
And what kind of surgery is that?
But rest assured.
and you can spend your time however you like.
Thanks to the surgery, all children can become proper adults.
You do what you like?
Some lovely, colorful flowers.
Congrats!
You two have proven yourselves to be fine adults.
Thank you very much.
Yes. It's your final week, so even our guests won't mind.
Tell them everything you just said was a mistake!
You wanderer!
That's enough now.
Our country has its own rules, as well.
We're a country of adults, after all.
You're a failure.
Hey, I think that's far enough now, don't you?
Yeah. Sorry.
Hey, what did you just call me?
That's what you just said when I asked you your name.
Nice name, right?
Do I have one?
Hmm... Hermes, huh?
Hermes, huh?
So that you might be happy.
Or what?
Fields of Sheep.
It's making me sleepy.
I won't, Hermes.
You're just too heavy, Hermes.
Then we should avoid disturbing them.
Are they trying to eat you, Kino?
I don't like the sound of either.
I've had a lot of scary moments with animals,
but I never thought sheep would...
Sure doesn't look like it.
To where?
The sheep won't be able to follow. It's too steep.
It's way too wide.
Maybe if we had a jumping ramp...
so you don't need to hurry too much.
I only have a few days' worth of food.
If I get too hungry,
I don't think so.
Boy, you're putting on quite a show, Kino.
Hermes!
Welcome back.
Hey, you pulled it off!
Accelerate slowly but firmly.
brave sheep that didn't fear any opponent.
Napping. Hard.
And what about when you wake up?
if I think of this as the end of my journey,
In other words,
I can't carry this much luggage on my own, either.
Now, goodnight, Hermes.
There.
there will be plenty of hardship and sadness lying on the road ahead.
Traveling is fun,
Hmph! Whatever.
Listen, in that country, you can kill people.
Murder isn't prohibited by their laws.
Yeah, of course.
Besides, you've heard, right?
They caught him once,
Huh?!
Maybe.
Well, let's go.
Do you understand that?
Very well. Go ahead.
The streets are clean, many people come and go,
The public order is great.
Too bad.
We're going out once I finish breakfast.
Let's take a look around this country.
Enjoy.
Maybe share some stories from beyond the wall in exchange?
Will you eat it again today?
How far will you be going?
Someone who can kill others.
On the motorrad!
What are you two yapping about?!
I'll give you a quick death...
Shit!
Who did that?!
You...
My, my, how dangerous.
I don't see what the big rush is...
Our destination: here and there
That's all it takes for today to become tomorrow
You can use any weapon you want.
They all give us the stupidest vacant looks
I'm saying I'd like you to lead me there so I can participate in the match.
Seven years ago.
Well, it's a dark, cool place with the right humidity.
Every now and then, I should use my abilities to the fullest.
It's no use.
An old man?
Oh?
Actually, I'm pretty sure Kino's plotting something bad in addition to this match,
I'm Shizu.
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him...!
You don't mean...
A while back... Quite some time ago...
They said that's where they were headed.
Honestly, I was planning to cut that man down when I won and received my medal.
For the past seven years.
No way! The dog talked! How?!
What's wrong with a talking dog?
Go ahead.
Hmph. Pervy dog.
I know this, and so
I hope we meet again somewhere, Kino. Hermes, too.
Later, pervy dog.
I thought you two would've gotten along.
Hey, Kino!
True.
"Anywhere will do"
But in life, he hated grandeur, so we chose to express his way of life
It was destiny!
This way, please.
Maybe it really was lucky.
What do you think?
Is that so?
Not to be on display.
It's probably because I wanted to do it even when no one was ordering me to.
You never know. It might answer you.
Did you hear anything about me from her?
You'll catch a cold if you go out dressed like that.
Oh, this is my housekeeper.
What a strange country.
A country moving on caterpillar tracks, huh?
Is that so?
Traveler, is there anything you'd like to ask us?
I work for the government now.
A farmer's daughter from the outskirts of the country
that he met while she was selling vegetables in the city.
"Your lover has left on a journey, but she'll return to you one day, so wait for her."
That automatically grants you the right to participate in the fights.
and allowed to add one new rule to this country's laws.
That was the best show!
Huh?
Lead me there.
I'm saying I'd like you to lead me there so I can participate in the match.
Seven years ago.
If I don't, my skills will get rusty before I know it.
You're up, 24.
That's amazing, 24!
Oh, right.
An old man?
After bottling his rage for all those years,
Then other ruffians heard about it and gathered here,
Done.
Why?
Yeah, that's right.
so I'm more worried about that.
I'd like you to yield.
The answer is simple.
What?
You're strong.
I refuse.
To tell the truth, I haven't killed a single person in this country yet.
I am now a citizen.
you should leave this country at once.
They said that's where they were headed.
They did.
She was alone then.
You should definitely stop by that country, Kino.
Thank you.
Was.
What's wrong with a talking dog?
Hello.
You're welcome.
A man who's plotted to kill his own father has no right to be king.
Yeah. There might be things I don't know, too.
Slave! Slave! Slaves are stupid!
We went to sell goods in that country like we always do,
so please take her as a servant,"
What a wonderful country!
...was telling me to go see this vast world.
You're a hopeless idiot.
I would choose death for myself first.
All right, all right.
Look, look!
Slave!
--I refuse to live that life, no matter what happens. --Sorry...
Luck is everything in this world.
Oh... That's right.
--Now, everyone, let's enjoy tonight's meal. --They' all die!
Please don't eat any more than you have!
R-Really?!
Good luck with it, young master.
Make her shut up!
Wh-What happened?
Please, I beg you... Please kill me.
Please. I beg you.
Here!
You think that lot would've stopped eating?
You're free. Did you hear me?
There's something I need you to do for me.
That's right.
The time she turned the tables on me during training.
Why, indeed...
Our destination: here and there
What is it?
Looks like their technology is fairly advanced, too.
You can sell them real high in countries like this.
He's in the detention cells underground.
Could you show mercy and use your authority to issue exile as his punishment?
What'll you give me for it?
Sister! You've come to rescue me?!
That's enough.
A silencer and a plastic knife.
That 50?
We could just exile him wherever,
Maybe I'll decide later with a roll of the dice.
I'd go hide somewhere we wouldn't be found, like an attic or a sewer pipe.
You want to unleash your full strength every now and then, right?
And then, and then?
The exact opposite.
Master and her apprentice climbed to the clock tower roof,
until the country said, "We've opened it for you, so please go through."
They'd be shot.
Three days and nights.
So that's how it ended, apparently.
Perfect timing.
There's the clock tower, too.
Could you tell me more about it?
When I was still young, corruption was rampant in our government.
O-Oh, I wonder what it was...
Looks like we won't have to make dinner ourselves.
How'd it go?
I don't think it'd be bad to try living here for a while.
Hey, Mama!
Yes.
What do you mean?
We have records of this.
cause such incidents against their will.
We cannot punish him for that.
The waves just grow stronger the closer you get, until they drive you mad.
I see.
Were you able to destroy the radio outpost?
Oh! And?
Don't lie to us!
Give him back!
So we're leaving the country.
Wait!
There's a young man with a sword, a little girl, and a dog.
Now then, is that group suitable to become our prey or not?
No, it's a hand grenade.
Elder!
Right. The person riding the motorrad is a boy... No, that's a girl!
No good. Zero points.
The people we should target are those
Now, don't be discouraged.
You're still young.
Right.
By the way, I heard it was your idea to post a lookout like this.
E-Everyone, run!
Where shall we go?
That's all it takes for today to become tomorrow
It varies, but the easiest to understand is...
Figures.
On the other hand,
There's hardly anyone who believes it's all right to indulge in a little crime
just because they've built up points.
A great wealth of them.
Wow!
But there's no need to force yourself to kill someone, is there?
Oh! I'm so grateful!
Have you all heard the rumors about the wandering chef?!
Yeah! They say he'll make exquisite meals no matter what ingredients he uses, right?!
Do you know who this chef is?
No scrimping on the sansho peppers, either!
What is it, Hermes?
How do you think the people of that country are faring?
Maybe they were all just really enjoying it.
Either way, that was a weird country.
Oh? What kind of dishes are they?
Then I'll hang it up for you.
Ti, Riku, sorry for the wait.
I could never forget it.
Well, I wonder what it'll be like.
What is it, Kino?
All right.
Well, to put it simply,
The end.
Really?
I've heard some things about it.
"They're just unkind and disagreeable."
How many days are you planning to stay?
The inn near my house is cheap, and the food's good, too.
My parents run a hotel.
Of course!
What does it mean?
Welcome to our inn.
This is my father and my mother, the proprietor and manager of this hotel.
Straight down this road?
Let me see.
Yeah, got it.
At this rate, our children will die!
Is that the traveler who just joined us?
so why don't we start over from the beginning?
until one day, when they wandered deep into the woods.
But we have nothing left to give the children...
No one will throw stones and chase us out!
You certainly have skill.
It's better than when I first got my hands on it.
I'd like to ask you something.
and you two are the first!
Such a lovely country deserves a lovely tour guide like you.
so I can become a better and better tour guide!
This guy looks just like the one I used to travel with.
Give me another day, and he'll be happily moving around again.
Well, not on their own, to be precise.
Hermes.
That's why tomorrow...
The one to become an adult.
Huh? How is it violent?
You do what you want to do?
What do you like doing most?
I'm surprised!
I see.
You must have raised her wrong!
Traveler, every country and every household has its own rules.
and staying any longer cuts into the time I can spend seeing other countries.
It's for disposing of this girl here.
Parents make children,
It was an accident.
Option three, then.
Hey, I think that's far enough now, don't you?
Yeah.
Is it not?
So, what do we do now?
? So that you might be happy ?
What do we do now?
Where shall we go?
Oh, they woke up.
I don't like the sound of either.
You've hunted and eaten several of them.
That was a close call!
We'd be in real trouble if we'd fallen down there.
Right.
To where?
So lay me down and leave me here.
Do you think we could go back and cross over by jumping it?
It looks like these sheep target humans.
I'll figure out some way to come back and get you!
I'm so glad you taught me how to use these, Master.
I'm all good!
Take this!
Don't blame me for this.
Too late now!
Ah, this is cruel!
Roger that.
That's a lot to ask.
Kino, if you're eating any, you should eat one like that.
I don't think I'm injured.
Though I never intended to fall over.
A lot of them.
We used selective breeding to create robust, brave sheep that didn't fear any opponent.
I'll have to let all our citizens know the good news!
Now, this way, you two.
What a pleasant spot.
This might be the best spot in the whole world for a hammock.
In other words,
Well, what do we do?
Until you do?
Good grief.
Kino.
But what if you suddenly get shot?
But I couldn't think of a better idea.
I'm the immigration officer,
Where is it heading?
While we're at it,
Indeed.
I see.
It says they're for guests.
Who knows?
Time to sleep.
That's the one thing we can't do anything about.
It always pains us to leave such a huge mark on mother nature.
then we'll cover it in a protective coating.
Today I'll show you our fields.
I'm the president of this country.
Please relax and enjoy the proceedings.
They're obstructing us.
Hello, I am this country's diplomat.
That's great news.
Even if our cannons won't work,
so the education board is requesting that we deal with it.
Huh?
They're doing it on purpose.
What's that?
I'll explain things to the children later.
let me handle it.
I mean, that obstructing country sealed off the plains on purpose
If they'd asked for something other than the Woodsman,
But one thing is for sure.
What?
Not that much, I suppose.
Apparently they trade like that as they travel along the coast.
I've decided.
I'll have the same lifestyle and labor as the common people, then.
Please, eat up.
It's very good.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
It's starting to shake.
They've left the worn and broken parts alone instead of repairing them. So...
There's no need to worry, Shizu.
You truly are kind, Shizu.
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this,
Whatever happens to anyone is their own fate.
You're not bad.
It's Shizu.
They all boarded another ship and fled to another country.
The only passengers aboard were a few hundred young children.
What about Ti?
and refused to be involved with her.
Even if I didn't know all that, what I said to you was cruel.
From now on, you... and I... will...
Don't leave me.
All's well that sends well.
As long as I continue traveling,
If we ever see that man again in the future, then...
It's an ordinary house.
Is there something over there, too?
The trowel he used for gardening.
It's because he really loved flowers!
He always kept this knife close to him.
Oh, nothing. Your story's very interesting.
We have the motorrad he rode stored in the back room.
After he passed,
Motorrads were born to be ridden.
I can't do that, either.
What can I do to become a traveler like you?
That I'm going to inherit our inn.
I wouldn't know.
But there's more than one way to be one.
You know the first president's motorrad is in the memorial hall, right?
There's only one gate travelers can use.
You'll catch a cold if you go out dressed like that.
I should be the one to tell his story.
They got along quite well, and I was certain they would marry.
But...
He might have died, and he couldn't tell her what he was doing.
I see.
What?
we thought she was a perfect fit and hired her.
I'll be fine!
and I made contact with that man.
Uh-huh.
I've been lying to that man since the first time I met him.
It was just the generator running at the gate.
but I'm sure she'll come home someday.
Let go of me!
Not my friend's way of life as a spy for the royal family...
You're a liar.
Later, hero.
And maybe one day I'll meet the same fate because I didn't know any better.
Of course, I'd like to avoid that,
Hey, hey, give me a snack!
Slave! Slave! Slaves are stupid!
That country was a religious nation, as you know,
What a wonderful country!
You still believe the teachings of the guys who sold you?
I mustn't.
I swear...
We picked a bunch!
Come on!
Why?
Would someone shut her up?
Father, I need to talk to you.
I was too late to realize it... I didn't remember in time.
I thought, "Let them all die."
I couldn't save them.
Yes. Then place your right hand around the narrowest part.
Where...
I won't hesitate to hit you.
Once it does, you die.
So that's my only choice...
I'll be the one in a jam if you don't.
We go somewhere together.
I'll let you go first.
Only the ones found growing this high up are poisonous.
And now she works as a photographer.
Long ago, she told the guard up on that mountain with the poisonous herbs,
Too bad.
You look like you're eating sand.
This looks like a nice country, doesn't it?
Looks like their technology is fairly advanced, too.
It's such a historic building, the clock tower has been preserved as a cultural monument.
When I bought it, it cost me 434 silver coins!
These are that man's belongings.
Thank you, sir.
So warm!
Honestly, you're such a troublesome apprentice.
By the way, were my toys helpful?
I'd go hide somewhere we wouldn't be found, like an attic or a sewer pipe.
Wow, how terrifying!
Talk about adding fools to the fire!
They then went into the provision stores
They didn't run?
Master and her apprentice climbed to the clock tower roof,
I asked her the same question.
Eventually, they put a letter in an envelope and dropped it down.
Using the officers' own equipment, of course.
The blowing winds have grown colder as of late,
an8and has requested the citizens remain calm and patient.
That was foolish.
She said the broadcasts were a big help, telling them exactly
we'll hang you after dragging you through the streets!
If you two wish to leave our country,
Please. Honestly, from the bottom of our hearts, please stop this.
She's a demon.
It's octagonal. This must be it.
I see. So this stone commemorates that?
but what happened to your leg?
Yeah. But what an optimistic country.
Don't worry.
But I plan to learn.
Starting tomorrow, I'd like to look around this country
Right off the vine.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hey, Mama!
We believe the remains found at the scene...
If you hadn't stopped that man,
How does this relate to the current incident?
This was all because of those machines and their radio waves.
Then allow me to take on that job for you.
If we destroy them completely and take photographic evidence,
Why did you decide to fight against the radio waves?
is absolutely false.
Why?
I am under no such influence.
Don't lie!
He's been possessed by the radio waves!
Give him back!
Wh-What?!
About that radio outpost...
I knew it!
Right.
It just tastes good when you eat it with that croissant over there.
Don't tell me... you came all the way out here just to step on your own shadow?
Yeah.
When we departed, too.
She's holding something black and round.
He'd easily sniff out our ambush.
Now then, is that rider suitable to become our prey or not?
No good. Zero points.
You can keep learning.
Right.
It happened long ago.
It varies, but the easiest to understand is...
I see.
You lose a little for minor offenses,
Yes.
when someone who's always done bad things happens to do something good,
I believe I've brought prosperity to many people's lives.
How many?
So you're debating what to do about that?
It's not like that!
Oh, President!
Kino's fried chicken has become our country's specialty,
At first I was upset at the thought of having a knockoff of our own specialty, but...
Though it can't compare with the impact of our Kino's fried chicken.
Here they are! We have Kino's original fried chicken and Kino's mild fried chicken.
"May my love become mutual."
They say that if you write your wish down and hang it up,
I could never forget it.
Wha... What?
Huh? But wait...
What is this?!
I consented to the treatments and entered the country to stay for three days.
Yeah?
Naturally.
But I can't.
In fact, you enjoyed your stay there more than any country we've been to.
Huh?
Everyone was so kind!
Who knows?
Don't give up on your dreams! It's important, so I said it twice!
is proof of that!
Who knows?
is at its end.
Kind Country.
I heard that this country is very developed...
That's definitely a lie.
I'm surprised someone like you let me fall over.
I guess I got a little too excited from riding so fast for such a long time.
I'm Kino.
I'd like to stay here for three days.
Rather than three days, stay here as long as you wish.
We'll help you of course.
However, now you can go wherever you want in the city.
Tomorrow afternoon, right?
Hello.
You meant, "You can't judge a book by its cover"?
That plays a part too, but there's someone I want to meet.
Meet him, and thank him.
Umm...
This is from a boy named Logue.
and works the fields.
So then you started writing to each other?
When I take the medicine, I feel bad for a while.
No... Kino and Hermes, you must have seen places where birds fly, right?
I learned it by heart, we'll be fine.
My name's Hermes.
As I thought, I felt like I was being watched.
So I can't deliver this.
Why was Logue killed?
This country is trying with all its might to overcome that disease,
Logue is actually in a place very close to Inertia.
But Logue definitely didn't die in vain.
A medicine to delay the disease has been developed!
Inertia will be able to benefit from it soon!
I guess I have to write a reply.
You're the silent type, eh?
A traveler who averts their eyes from the truth can't become happy, Kino.
be1After many nights
be1I sing for you
be1I sing for you
That's definitely a lie.
Well done.
We'll help you of course.
Even though we're outside, your voice echoes.
But it's a little awkward.
And this is my wife.
Here's the person you've been waiting for.
When I first thought about a traveller on a motorcycle,
Do you know about my illness?
Umm...
There's an observation room, right above this one.
This is from a boy named Logue.
One year ago.
Shortly afterwards, Logue and his family were sent off as a pioneer group.
You will definitely be able to see him for yourself.
I learned it by heart, we'll be fine.
What are you doing in a place like this?
I wasn't imagining it.
Why was Logue killed?
And those subjects were the pioneer groups?
Half a year ago, it was decided that Logue's family would become experiment subjects.
Inasha will be able to benefit from it soon!
I guess I have to write a reply.
And...
Please lead me
Sora wa hateshinai kokoro no kagami dakara ne

Wake up!
Are you listening?
Good morning, Hermes.
As usual.
But?
You're being called.
You're welcome.
Get ready.
Well, she's better than she was at first.
Is that wrong?
Then...
It's still early.
Even so, I get the feeling that "Master" has a strange ring to it.
Apologize.
You should head to that house first and explain everything to the person living there.
This must be it.
Now I know.
But I'm truly happy you came.
If it weren't for you...
Thus, we went to approach your teacher, but you came instead.
You're welcome.
That is good.
Would you tell me some more stories of your travels?
And how about the sniper in the forest?
The sniper?
an7kinou to chigau nanika wo suru tame ni
Concealing my tears that seem about to overflow.
I want to embrace my transience and reach out my hand.
In order to do something
Wake up!
How is she?
Simply being a good driver does not guarantee winning the race.
And here are the vegetables and bacon.
Let's go.
This coat was given to me by a traveler at a hotel in a neighboring country.
and he, who was going somewhere warmer, kindly gave it to me.
No, I will not stop you.
Please!
Starting tomorrow, we will begin intense training. Do you understand?
Adjust the speed to match the condition of the road.
Kino, I have something I want to talk to you about.
As I said before, we don't know how things will fall.
I'm lending you this to protect you on your journey.
Note: "Shishou" means "teacher" or "master".
I still haven't asked you what you intend to do when you get there.
Could you be a friend of my son?
You see, if someone dies while traveling, the body never returns.
She thought all passing travelers were her son's enemy.
Would you tell me some more stories of your travels?
No.
Yesterday, I could not yet see it.
To do something different from yesterday.
It's impossible to start a journey like this.
But what's going to happen to me?
with a mummified version of you.
The most important thing for a traveler
A "map made from measurements taken just a month ago," my butt!
Yeah, but we should be able to go straight here...
Everyone and everything has a certain place in life, Kino.
Neither motorrads nor people were made to fly.
Kino, don't tell me you're going to suggest going there.
The world is constantly changing.
What a useful machine, huh?
What if there's no one in the town, either?
Welcome, traveler.
Yeah! It was very good.
Cheapskate.
You could be king, Kino.
Nothing wrong with having at least one country like this in the world.
As long as the travelers who come here don't run into any trouble.
We're going to leave this country tomorrow, right?
but there was only one place where you tried to stay longer than three days.
That was a bit extreme.
But a group of our country's best scientists made that possible.
All across the country... Meaning everyone?
We shared a mutual love for one another.
She was very much into raising flowers,
I know!
once you're a few dozen meters apart,
Thanks to the machines, we can still lead our lives without any trouble.
Huh?
"Don't die, okay?"
And?
I'm not sure...
warm soup, steak, fois gras, fish meuniere, cake for dessert...
because it reminds me of their red eyes from that one time.
To whom?
It's not very pleasant, Kino.
I have some portable rations,
But many animals will soon be waking up from hibernation.
Please wait, I'll prepare it for you to eat.
Kino-san, here.
I understand that even the portable rations I ate were made
But in this situation, even though I hold neither resentment
Is that because they're your fellow humans?
Time to go to work.
Thanks to you I feel much better.
Hey, is it possible that you really do like that ring after all?
will be able to find happiness.
How kind of you.
It was good, very good.
Take off your winter coat. Slowly.
What do you see?
These things will always happen.
But some fortunes turn out to be right, though.
Thanks. Bye.
he's returned as a man of integrity,
Did you think you were the only one with a dragon?
I'm sure we've just been lucky.
the little seeds I have sown may sprout
What you must be most careful of is not to lose your life.
at this rate, I'll run out of gas
that the last country didn't have any motorrad fuel for sale.
we may get him to share some fuel with us... for free.
I appreciate it.
Hermes!
He is living a life divorced from the desires of the ordinary world.
I see.
During his wandering journey, he arrived in a country
the king passed by and jokingly said
"Please move,
It is said that the king was so touched by those words
It's not true.
But that is not because I found enlightenment
What do you mean by that?
There are countries like that everywhere.
That's what they thought.
After repeated experiments,
What they wanted was a human who had no self-consciousness,
so I did just enough to satisfy these areas.
you will be restored to the person you were before.
There is just one thing I am thankful for.
I asked him,
Let me think.
The Great Wise Man seems to have calmed down.
I see.
I am from the country where he was born.
My job is to keep an eye on him, the failure,
I see.
Then why didn't you shoot him?
That maybe I'm a terribly dirty human being.
But at times like that,
Not that.
I'm Kino.
Three days.
I'm so impressed.
You may bring them in if they are for your protection.
But I'm sure you won't need them.
Yes.
If you want to know more about it, let me think...
and consequently, the castle walls were also expanded.
it ends up needing contact with other countries.
and many people died.
they would repeatedly exhaust national resources
Yes.
Are you no longer fighting your neighboring country?
What are we going to see?
Scoring ten to nine, the winning country is Veldelval!
Is that your so-called war?
But that is our version of war.
The children volunteered one after another to avenge their father.
He went off promising to come back alive,
Is that the war I saw yesterday?
When I announced this idea,
Besides...
And that sacrifice absolutely cannot be our children.
I do not know if you are wrong now
and there, you will be torn limb from limb in front of our eyes
In this case, it is you, who just happened to pass this way.
to satisfy our desire for revenge, even if it is only a little.
but I do not want to die.
Oh, Kino.
Where do you like best among all the countries you visited?
and the girl who has the name of a flower.
They say, "They serve only terrible food."
It's a beautiful country.
It may turn out to be a really memorable and unforgettable country.
What?!
Three days.
Oh, welcome! Welcome!
Could you tell me if there's a place I can stay at?
Hello. I'm Kino.
They're my father and mother.
They run the hotel and are also tour guides for this area.
What is it?
Hang on tight.
Are you looking after it properly?
Yeah...
I'd like to ask you to repair a Persuader.
I need to take care of it later.
Good things happen if you live long enough.
Long, long ago, there were people who were persecuted
but none of the countries accepted them.
Excuse me, Traveler.
They get married awfully young.
Do you know someone like that, Traveler?
No, I don't.
Would you take it?
Look over there!
Yes. That's a fantastic job.
No matter when or where it is,
Is that right?
In a little while,
This country was totally different from the rumors.
Make sure, Kino-san.
I've made very nice memories.
It was a good country.
It's heading towards that country.
When we started giving up because there were only three days left,
Dear Kino-san,
What shall we do?
I just close my eyes in the darkness
If we leave now, we can still make it,
I've had enough!
Rejected.
I don't like the sound of either.
I forgot.
I'm not sure.
Even if you stay in one place,
A traveler's purpose in life is to travel.
Huh?
Don't forget about me.
What is it?
You're sure that the price you mentioned is correct, right?
Are you sure you aren't mistaking me for royalty or something?
Did you finish cleaning them?
If you were the only one, yeah?
Ever since we took off from master's place,
Whoa...
Why is everyone in this country locked up all by themselves?
The scientists used that technology to make an epochal invention.
What happened after that?
I'll tell you about what happened to me.
There was only one thing to do,
Because in the end,
Because after we both drank the liquid machines,
And the journey will never end
I travel the world, going where the currents take me
You're just listing food names now.
Even on a night when I'm alone and can't fall asleep
I hope there's a repair shop in the next country.
I'm sorry.
What?
And this is my partner, Hermes.
Yes.
Yes.
is to your liking.
I will be in the back room recharging my energy.
Kino, did it suit your tastes?
After seeing the facility in the basement,
Please take care of the rest of the housework.
All I know is how to clean the house,
What?
First of all, the meter's still broken.
So, it'll be postponed, huh?
Here you go.
Maybe you should rest for a while.
It was good.
The old woman still didn't look well,
Please take me to them.
Yeah.
I am so glad...
Well, we'll be leaving now.
Who the woman we just buried was.
I'd love to.
Oh, my goodness!
She devoted herself to her research.
She had a little party prepared.
We were made to do something for humans.
And the journey will never end
I travel the world, going where the currents take me
What's important when you're traveling?
Aren't these starting to become more trivial things?
Shiroku haita kemuri kumo ni natte
I close my eyes and make a wish
Hitori-kiri de nemurenai yoru ni ochitemo
Tomorrow,
"If you truly meant what you said,
I see.
And I wasn't able to tame it.
And I think of that as the journey of my life.
May I ask you a question,
Because I just pass through.
Are you going to keep traveling even knowing that?
Someone needs to preach the ideal!
You love her, don't you?
He's really good if he can do this without her noticing it at all.
it looks like her journey will continue for a long time to come.
Hermes!
Hermes...
That was when,
in the forest that we got lost,
I don't dislike it, Hermes.
and we won't make it to the next country.
No, I am his caretaker.
Perhaps that is human instinct,
but that isn't an acceptable excuse for the country's leaders.
And how is this related to you?
I do not have a clear recollection of that time period.
Everybody has a monster called "self-consciousness" in them.
Or you want to kill people who insulted you.
What they wanted was a human who had no self-consciousness,
I'll give you one hint.
As I wandered through many countries,
The only true words in the world, huh?
And that's the "real blue sky"?
Yeah.
I'm not sure if that's the right answer or not,
There is no such thing.
I see.
I do not know.
I'm trying to live my life consciously.

flocks of birds...
Hardworking machines.
Koboresou na namida kakushite ite
Yami no naka ni hitomi tojite
Sometimes I feel that
and realize how much I love it.
So,
Is that a satisfactory answer?
I may be hesitating.
Oh, well. I'm going to sleep.
We'll need to go quite far again tomorrow.
This is Hermes, my partner.
It's finished.
Because this country is at peace now.
It'll tell you a lot about this country.
Good! Next! Take aim!
I can't count on what you say, Kino.
Oh, don't worry.
They were my priceless treasure, but...
where there were casualties in either of our countries.
is so little that it is incomparable
Once you become a little older,
I'm sure.
For our revenge.
We are massacred for no reason and we cannot even bury our loved ones.
Where did I come from? How far will I go?
and the girl who has the name of a flower.
I just close my eyes in the darkness
And like the moon in the blue sky,
It makes me curious to know
It may turn out to be a really memorable and unforgettable country.
Hey, Gloomy!
Really? A traveler?
Do you need anything?
My place is a hotel. My parents run it.
Uh...
It's not something I can explain.
They're my father and mother.
We'll prepare a room for you right away.
Here are the groceries.
Yes, please.
I'll think about it.
Grandpa!
If there's somewhere I can understand the history of this country...
Yes, there is.
but none of the countries accepted them.
they got lost deep in the forest.
But the blessings of the forest saved the lives of the starving people.
They decided to build a new country as their permanent settlement
We are all taught our history starting when we are little.
They get married awfully young.
I want to ask you a question.
Yes?
I see. Thank you.
I understand. I'll use it humbly.
I see.
No.
become a great hotel manager,
I'm sure you can.
the stars shine upon the world in the same way.
But it's strange.
Is that right?
I wonder why?
We have brought your luggage.
If you're going west and camping out, the mountain ridge should be good.
Sakura. My name is Sakura.
Volcanic ashes and pumice spew out with high heat
and run down the surface of the mountain at a high speed.
To abandon the country or not.
But we were born here
You may think we're selfish,
Either way, traveling riding tandem would've been impossible.
Dareka ga nurenagara sotto furueru
So the beautiful world...
Concealing my tears that seem about to overflow
I just close my eyes in the darkness
Yuzurenai kara hadashi de mo hashiri-tsuzukeru
We've been here since the beginning of winter.
I got one.
Thanks a bunch!
Kino, you don't want any food?
I see. I will take this as a reward after everything is over.
You've gone hunting lots of times before this.
There!
You mean, "Charity is not for the sake of others"?
But isn't it going to be so great!
Who you talking about?!
When I return home from this journey,
In our country, as soon as the fall harvest festival ends,
Right before winter, we pass through this area
That's the Homecoming Festival.
Yeah, you could say that.
Here's a song that we always play for travelers.
We did it!
Great job, Hermes, you must be tired.
I see.
Take off your winter coat. Slowly.
I'm impressed you figured it out.
I didn't think the rabbits' wounds were from a .44 caliber.
This is the last one.
Mori ni mayoi sora ni yorisou
Visiting countries, coming and going among people
Where did I come from? How far will I go?
I travel the world, going where the currents take me
Sora wa hateshinai kokoro no kagami dakara ne
The sky is boundless, because it's the mirror of my soul
Even on a night when I'm alone and can't fall asleep
I'll keep running, even barefooted, because I can't give this up
A whale's sigh...
then your stay will coincide with the end of the world.
Until the day after tomorrow?
There's no need for that.
The Book of Prophecy?
Besides, why tomorrow?
When will the world come to an end?
What is?
Nobody knows how the world began,
You want to get going soon?
Kino, are you ready for this?
You're not aware of any?
It's so we can prepare a welcome for you.
Welcome, traveler!
Traveler, please go ahead and eat as much as you like!
Yes, sir!
Yes.
So, they came up with the idea
This is a sad country, whose tradition is to continue passing down the sorrow.
When he sang of the beauty, magnificence and joy of the world,
and the joy of life naturally tumbled from his lips.
The king told him that if he could not do this,
he would have the poet's head.
at the same time it chops down desire with a stone axe.
She then continued to recite her father's poem for the next ten years.
Yes.
Yes.
A book of prophecy was passed along to our country.
have crossed the sky and the night has passed,
Nagareru mama sekai o hashiru
The world is going to end.
There are a lot of people who are looking nowhere but out to the sea.
There's no need for that.
What makes it a prophetic book?
But that too, will end tomorrow, right?
About the things I sold you yesterday...
Father! It's the Father from the northern tower!
has been completely flawed in his deciphering technique.
Here! For the time being, please fill this out!
Uh... Thank you so much.
a noble group of thieves called the Cat Ear Party.
Traveler, come back again!
What kind of tradition should we do next time?
and make them participate in their "tradition".
But they already have a magnificent tradition, don't they?
Don't mention it, it was my pleasure.
And we will continue to do so.
It is the poem of sorrow.
So that words of sorrow would well up from the bottom of his heart.
The edges of my fading memories, the far off, frozen, unreachable life.
The only time we are free from the sorrow is at night,
The mirage above the piece of paper...
The corpse sings with a necklace of many, many tears on its breast...
It wasn't a very fun country to visit, was it?
To each his own I guess.
but apparently, the poet's words were recorded in a book quite some time ago.
and directions on how we could avoid it.
The way that country's coastline is round and curved,
It was not written exactly how much constitutes smashing the plate,
My desires fly on the wings of my dreams...
I can see the world's reflection in your smile...
Some place on the cheap side with a shower would be great.
This way!
What is that?
What? Oh!
How long do you plan on staying with us?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Wait a little while longer and this guy will be moving around.
The motorrad's going to be moving around?
In this situation, it's where you'll make a promise to help each other.
if someone's not riding him and providing balance.
Everyone younger is a child.
Everyone, got it?
And then, you'll be able to do everything,
I have no idea what you mean by "perfect adult."
No,
I often sing during my journeys.
You filled my daughter's head with that foolish idea!
Okay, let's leave it at that for now.
you do understand that every country has
And they are not problems that you can do something about.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Are you leaving already?
You defective girl...
What should I do now?
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Whoa! That was scary.
Kino...
Hey...
And thank you.
I am...
What a great name!
I see. So it's Hermes.
Okay, once we get out of this forest.
Nagareru mama sekai o hashiru
And my most important job of all...
The sky is boundless, because it's the mirror of my soul
Even on a night when I'm alone and can't fall asleep
I don't really like riding through the forest.
Because of the caterpillars?
No, but they don't help.
The real reason is because
I don't want to bump heads with one of those.
I'm sorry to ask,
but that it might eventually be put to use again,
No, I already had a wife and child when I originally left home.
They should be getting my paychecks,
A story, is it?
This country was widely talked about, even among the travelers.
Welcome, traveler.
It sure looks like it, doesn't it?
So we can have stress.
It's really tough on us. Some people get ulcers,
but, the machines do all the things necessary to help the people.
Isn't it an amazing idea?
and that's work!
Do you like living in this country?
That's enough talk about me.
If I had been born in a country like that,
These tracks are awfully clean
That's right.
Of course, I've been doing this forever.
They said they had an old track
I see.
It was necessary!
We'd had enough of one person in power calling all the shots.
And so he ended up paying for his sins
Oh, it was great fun.
when everything is determined by vote.
Who would stop the elected guy if he started running wild?!
They were found guilty by the majority.
All those who opposed were executed.
How many executions have taken place so far?
It was just a cold.
Kino, we should be leaving soon.
Get out of here!
Get out of this country right now!
Will do.
We must have lost sight of the direction we should be going, huh?
I agree with that.
it doesn't matter which way we go.
But that's no reason to go right!
Touku de furidashita ame
Soshite tabi wa owaranai
So the beautiful world...
I just close my eyes in the darkness
A really wonderful country?
A wonderful country that every traveler would like to visit.
Be happy, you're number 24.
It means you have a chance to finally become a first class citizen.
A first class citizen?
The rest either live like rats in underground sewage towns
A brat like you?
Are you serious, Kino?
The fights.
You should have shot all the guys back there and left.
Oh, yeah.
I see.
Just enough so they don't die, okay?
Isn't that funny?
Did you lose as planned?
who won by accepting their opponents' surrenders.
What did you sa-
you'll have me next.
I won't forget this!
It's still better than the sewage town I live in.
Dad!
After all, we underground citizens
I never knew we got the new king
I feel sorry for your friend.
My first one is, what brought you to this country?
If you surrender now,
Please surrender.
No. I don't understand.
In a life or death battle, the winner survives and the loser dies.
Good job, Master Shizu.
Say, Kino?
So the beautiful world...
But Hermes...
What, Kino?
The sky is boundless, because it's the mirror of my soul
Shinjiru mono ga kowareteku toki ni wa
When something I have faith in begins to fall apart
Dazzling romance,
When the prince could bear it no longer,
And the prince succeeded the crown.
That is all right.
Have I met you somewhere before?
You must think I have gone mad.
Then why do you continue?
Yes, just as it did when I killed my father.
What did you say?!
When she was sick in bed, she told me that
So I want to make the date of my mother's death a national memorial day
You've done well.
Really?
I promise.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I just wanted to find out the meaning of that smile.
If I participate in the fights and learn more about this country,
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You will never be able to win.
Doesn't really matter though...
But you're too eager to win no matter what.
I've been told not to follow strange men easily.
I travel the world, going where the currents take me
If you could use magic,
what kind of magic would you want?
The same?
Yuzurenai kara hadashi de mo hashiri-tsuzukeru
And like the moon in the blue sky,
You're coming with me to meet my relatives today for sure!
You'll never get permission!
To begin with,
Before anybody had noticed,
It was because I surprised everyone with the devices I made
a story about a man who tried to fly.
the crop yields went up 4.7.
I have increased the yield 3!
I've heard enough.
It is to remove the bronze statue on the main street.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
But in that case,
you'd need a straight road of a certain length.
That's what I thought.
I can't ignore them anymore.
Please wait!
Please go home today.
I knew it as soon as you told us about it.
Right!
So, I'm sure you could.
I can't get enough speed to start with.
I can fly now!
The calculations, experiments, and my life...
Now, then.
Oh... Well...
it seemed like it was destined.
No, I'm not talking about that.
What's wrong, Hermes?
I'm just pondering the range of potential that people have.
It changes colors everyday, as if it's reflecting my heart
Shiroku haita kemuri kumo ni natte
Yami no naka ni hitomi tojite
...he issued one final order.
Have you seen it?
The traveler saw the tank off,
It wasn't a very interesting book.
Yeah.
Water...
but this is all I have right now.
There isn't, but...
but I wanted to be a writer.
It's smaller than I thought it would be.
Yes, sort of...
That's right.
Yes!
All the books brought here from around the world
We call the building of the Department of Reading and Welfare the Castle.
Critics cannot make any wrong decisions.
No.
All they have are children's books and how-to guides.
Did someone give you this book?
Yes.
so we can save our fellow members who were captured.
But I'm afraid I haven't heard anything about it.
So, we thought he might have known a secret passage
Since you're a top class Persuader shooter,
I'm only staying in this country for three days.
Once he finished reading all the books brought into the Castle,
Then he disappeared, proclaiming
And they say that book is still in the Castle.
of becoming a character in the story.
he doesn't seem very talented.
Excuse me?
While reading it, many come to believe that they are the traveler.
Find him!
Give it to her!
The Author will know...
with characters in the books and ruined themselves.
those that have passed the screenings,
"Are you reading that ancient book again, Kino?"
"Then this is perfect."
"You just need to live in the world of books."
"Forget that the world was ruined,
"Here you go."
I never knew my librarian was also infected.
Hey, Kino.
Classification of fantasy and reality
From that moment on, the world becomes a stage
Follow me.
Is that it?
What are you going to make us do?!
He would believe it was his role to come back here.
and the books caught fire!
I'll get going now.
How do you know that, Hermes?
So the beautiful world...
because you're always with me, Hermes.
But I thought humans like to live for others
Back then the whole land looked like a crimson sea too, didn't it?
Would you show me the way?
I see.
Oh, okay.
Welcome, traveler!
I'm fixing this motorrad.
Wait a little while longer and this guy will be moving around.
A motorrad can run really fast, but he'll fall over
But before that happens, I need to buy some parts.
Are there any shops like that in this country?
Sorry for the wait.
That's because they're adults.
And don't adults have to always work at some kind of job?
Some things, but the fun parts overwhelmingly outweigh the bad.
adults aren't allowed to do whatever they like.
Thanks to the operation, any kid can become a perfect adult,
do they enjoy life at all?
Before, you said that you were more of an adult than me.
It's fun to learn about all the different countries in the world.
so after that, I'll be happy, even if I have to work at the inn.
You imbecile!
Our foolish daughter here said
You filled my daughter's head with that foolish idea!
Yes.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Are you leaving already?
So you don't mind dying?
I'll give him balance, he'll give me speed.
Do as I say!
Hey...
And thank you.
When I asked for your name just now, that's what you said, right?
What a great name!
What about me?
You... Hermes!
I wonder if these are blossoming out of season?
even if my heart is full of sad words...
At least now we won't have to worry
The way the grass is springing up here,
but could I ask you to remove your motorrad from the tracks?
I've been doing this for a long time now.
Well, up we go.
so I just keep working.
and I think they are living well on them, but...
Yes, I suppose so.
People in that country didn't have to work.
It's been a while since we've been to a modern and organized country.
They're working, aren't they?
That's supposed to be the case, but...
But wasn't it that people in this country didn't have to work?
That's true, we don't have to.
Come again?
We're no match for the speed of the machines
because the machines do a good job of all the actual work.
May I ask you something?
It's my job.
so I was ordered to tear it down.
These tracks are awfully clean
No, I'm not very good at storytelling,
This country had been a monarchy for a long time.
We captured the royal family when they tried to flee
We'd had enough of one person in power calling all the shots.
Everything about the country was decided by majority vote.
And what happened after that?
Nothing could be more dangerous!
Of course, the majority disagreed with that idea and it didn't pass!
But the very fact that idiots who can't understand that
and he was executed.
It was just a cold.
That's right!
That'll be great!
Left! Right!
it doesn't matter which way we go.
Between a country with a good reputation
what kind of reputation does the next country have?
Yes. It's surrounded by forests.
It's supposed to be...
A first class citizen?
Yeah, as long as you can carry them with you.
In most cases,
Work that's harder than death will be waiting for you though.
Besides, do you even have a weapon, Kino-chan?
I could've done that.
What do you think?
I see.
Okay.
They were lucky enough to fight each other in the first game.
Okay. In that case, let's get out of-
but you're allowed to hear how the fights went
My hands are not so great that showing it would make a difference.
Nobody asked you out.
Jail, huh?
You saw it under the bridge.
This is even worse.
Yo!
Hey, stop. I'm still working!
Yeah. But...
The former king was a great man,
but his son is...
His son?
I never knew we got the new king
because the former king was killed.
I have two questions I'd like to ask before the fight.
you can leave without getting hurt.
See?
It would be bad to move the ignition rod now.
And you won against me, Missy.
That's a good name.
I refuse.
Then, get some rest tonight.
As a traveler, there is no way for me to know.
I felt no hesitation.
Put on my favorite play!
He was especially strict to his son.
Wait.
Is that right?
Wait.
I will let you become a first class citizen without fighting
You could've avoided death.
We don't have white flowers in my country.
Really?
Liar.
Besides, don't you need to watch the fight?
I refuse.
I surrender.
Don't you remember?
Kino, you were going to leave here quickly,
but what made you change your mind?
Then, I guess you wasted the last three days.
Not necessarily.
Why did you participate in the fights?
Me?
But you're too eager to win no matter what.
You need to enjoy the fight.
To have all the first class citizens fight to decide a new king.
You were the prince?
would you come to the next country with me?
What? You're kidding again.
Is it?
He's my fianc.
because he was a weird old man
Before anybody had noticed,
he was drawn to heaven without anyone by his side.
Nimya...
After I started living in the warehouse,
I thought I understood how the old man felt
I was sad,
It was...
my wish to fly the skies!
I have increased the yield 3!
Please give me permission for that, Chief!
What do you think the great god of the country is?
Wait!
Let me GO, stupid!
Oh my, how embarrassing!
I see.
I was bored because his speech was so long!
You slept through the whole thing, didn't you, Hermes?
once you got rid of this bronze statue?
and solved the problem of the propulsion.
Yes,
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
That's all.
but I imagine you already spent
Because I have things to do.
All right!
No good!
I should use the backlash instead of the bullet.
What's going on here, traveler?!
What in the-
Nimya, you are...
Nimya-sama,
But anyway, what a surprise.
The minute she succeeded,
they start saying, "It's magic!" And, "Please forgive us!"
No, I'm not talking about that.
Then why did you help her out?
when she met a tank.
Have you seen it?
I see.
I can understand that.
You're going to the land of books
To tell you the truth,
One book, is it?
has books from all over the world,
We have all the books from all over the world that you may read.
All the books here
After all, they are critics!
No.
Yes.
I knew it!
Did he happen to tell you where the entrance to the Castle was?
Yes.
It's a resistance movement.
I see.
but we haven't received the manuscript yet.
Who is this Author?
as if there's something magical about them.
Isn't the problem with
Some become so involved in the books,
"Here you go."
I never knew my librarian was also infected.
That means your role has been decided.
They are your seniors.
Critique books.
The worst kind of people?!
You!
get to the man who calls himself the Author.
by weaving an elaborate story.
Shall I tell you the other purpose of our system, traveler?
So,
If it was the Author, he would say,
That's truly everything of the world.
Are you really sure I can keep this book?
I thought about it and I don't need it anymore.
I'll write it myself from now on.
See?
I would be so happy if this old jalopy's cooking
Kino-san and Hermes-san.
How was dinner tonight?
Yeah.
What are we going to do?
See you later.
Yes, I will see you later.
Who created you?
I know, Kino-san.
I will take you to a wonderful place for lunch.
What?
Please watch the bottom of the valley very carefully.
Yes. I'm very surprised.
I suppose many people must have lived there supporting one another.
It's truly perfect!
before the master and his family come home.
How was it?
And?
but she was working hard.
When she was looking at the family, her eyes...
Yeah.
Then, please take a look at this first.
Fifty odd years ago,
and remodeled the basement of her house into a research lab.
That's right.
But...
what should we do after that?
If we don't do anything for humans,
Shall we go?
Yeah.
Aren't these starting to become more trivial things?
Shut up!
Because you tied your earphone cord around it while half-asleep.
When are you going to get over that fear of bugs, Shinichi?
A snake!
What are you doing?
What?
Wow.
Look! It's right
Whatever you were up to,
you know smartphone use isn't allowed during class.
burrow into human
I just didn't feel well.
It's morning...
I don't know where I came from.
"The brain"?
a life form resembling a human, but with a head that morphs.
Why me, anyway?
You're the one who ate my right hand without even asking first!
but it also seems the father is the killer, and now he's missing.
Fine with what?
This is a different route from yesterday.
Okay.
Go.
You said it's one of you...
It's around that corner.
A... A dog's eating another dog?!
It controls the rest of the body by seizing control of the nervous system,
but because the core itself morphed into wings,
That's why I was victorious.
"Life must be protected."
Parasyte
No way.
What's wrong with a little fun?
I g-guess...
Satomi says she'll forgive you
Yeah!
I'll never do it again!
I promise!
It's a promise, then.
It's not like that!
So were you talking to yourself to practice pick-up lines?
You weakling!
You'd better not have killed him.
Don't worry.
Hey!
There are pretty graphic videos being upped to the net, too.
They haven't caught him yet.
There will only be more victims if we don't do something.
If I tell the world about you and have them research you...
Ah.
I sense extreme terror.
More "Mincemeat Murders" Nationwide
We're mincemeat...
One's approaching.
Shinichi, where do you think you're going?
I want to meet this murderer face-to-face.
You'll get yourself killed.
Many people have been killed.
You're telling me I should just stand by and watch,
This human's brain survived, wholly intact.
Now, wait.
I understand where you're coming from.
But, Mr. Right Hand, you know you can simply move over to me.
What?
Now do you believe me?
But you won't have a choice once I cut off that human's head.
Migi...
Wha?
Animals aren't toys!
Are you kidding me?
Just like Migi said,
Izumi-kun.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, wait.
What's the hurry?
You're really my type.
No way.
This girl's special.
but even if you feel that I'm close, you should stay away.
Why do you think that?
You're worried about me?
If I leave her be,
Two.
I failed to avoid three.
The Metropolitan Police just held an emergency press conference.
She's wearing a collar.
Wait for me!
Hurry up, now.
Hey, it's not like...
Maybe I'm just getting old.
You're really acting like an old man now.
Okay.
Why are you going to the trouble of seeing her?
I can't ignore her when she says it's the last favor she'll ever ask.
I'm suddenly realizing
Would you be willing to forego your cars in order to prevent polluting the air?
Did he see us?!
but they do not seem to be very interested in us.
Now that we've seen a rare sight,
That dream again...
Parasyte
You have a point.
That'd put her at risk, too.
Shinichi.
I was just curious.
I didn't come here to fight.
Huh?
Have you ever felt that sensation from anyone other than me?
You idiot!
You've got it completely wrong!
So what if it was?
That's not it.
I wouldn't tell you such an elaborate lie just for something like that.
W-Well, I guess...
Hey, since I told you my secret,
All right.
Give me a break!
Or, rather, she's begun to emit a signal.
You're right.
Two of my kind are approaching.
See, Izumi? I can tell you apart from everyone else!
If only I hadn't promised to see Kana that day,
Wait!
Why...
Why do you go down so easily?!
An unfortunate incident, indeed.
He gave in to the immediacy of hunger,
His brain remains intact,
You could say that he is a valuable sample.
I ask you to consider my investigation of him as being a part of that endeavor.
I have it trained well, don't I?
It's of interest that his mother has gone missing
Please continue your investigation.
An "average high school student," huh?
But perhaps I'll try something.
It's not gloomy.
and he knew the girl who was killed.
B-Bye, Satomi.
No, that's not the point.
I can hardly believe he's human.
And?
I wonder what's wrong.
your father will become suspicious of all the noise.
and what he's doing now,
What are you doing?! Run!
we're finished.
We will become lab rats, without a doubt.
Ugh!
Stay away from me!
Izumi!
Hey, Izumi!
But before that happens, one of my kind may terminate us.
What should I...
that not even someone dying
I can't even talk to you if you're going to be like this!
You would've tried to kill him if I had.
Yeah, no shit.
You look exhausted.
But what about me?
I still haven't figured out what that thing was!
You definitely did!
When I saw how flustered that human was...
She's already asleep.
What're you implying?
Know my place, huh?
He's with you?
S-Sure, I'm all ears!
I told him everything that had happened
I have to at least believe some of it.
even if it would mean becoming a lab rat!
He's only a child from your perspective, isn't he?
So you're sticking with the whole "a P.I. never reveals his clients" thing, huh?
I didn't expect her to come calling so soon
This behavior may be instinctive.
who will have no impact on the transmission of their own DNA
it may be interesting to consider whether human efforts in the realm
It's almost time.
I chose this location
because others of my kind are rarely present.
I can just assume another identity, if necessary.
but I...
One of us fed on her!
Out of the way, humans!
What's the matter with you, Shinichi?
I haven't done anything to it yet.
You!
Fortune Teller
Fortune Telling
I killed that person.
Next time:
No.
Crap!
You're not one of us?
Yeah!
I knew,
That means our actions constitute
He even suspected me of being one of the monsters.
We may be in an extremely precarious situation right now.
Anyone who saw that and still thinks they can fight them is crazy!
You're no longer a normal human being!
From this day on,
I can do anything if I put my mind to it!
Looking back...
I don't think I've seen you two together lately.
I will protect
although I couldn't care less about the P.I.
However, I would like his body to be brought back intact.
Where is it right now?
Don't be so eager.
You'll be safe.
You'll be safe now.
In this scenario,
Why?
Just one?
Hello!
He's smiling.
He can't be a parasite, then...
Oh, hey!
Thank God he wasn't a parasite.
Maybe I was wrong...
Migi...
Migi!
it doesn't seem like victory was immediate, either.
I'm sure he's trying to get a feel for us.
He's pretty slow.
"Again"?
We'll have to gamble.
Above all,
You should stay a right hand, Miki.
and became a single lifeform.
Yeah, now is not the time to gawk in awe.
He's quite fast...
But I am not human,
Moving on,
were killed by a sharp, sword-like weapon.
Furthermore, Kuramori-san's office,
They must've decided that he's too dangerous to keep alive.
Dad, listen closely.
What's happened, Shinichi?
Why?!
I've been a good son in general, right? I never really acted out.
but I believe what I saw confirms my beliefs.
And after many things happened,
Of course!
though you'll forget all about it again.
Huh?
humans possess a different "brain" of enormous magnitude.
Something...
It's the bag Izumi-kun left behind.
It'll be a chance to patch things up, too.
Kuramori
Where is she going?
In fact, I am quite moved by your decision to lynch me.
Not fast enough!
Tamura is no longer capable of rational thought.
My legs...
It's not... me!
Don't!
How dare you...
How dare you?!
parasite cells continue to survive for a certain length of time
and emit signals,
Good morning.
I wonder what's going on.
Huh?
He has no idea how worried we are.
He'll come back... soon.
the things about Izumi-kun that I don't know.
Ugh!
To Mother- Come to Hikari Park 1 tomorrow at 5 PM -Detective Sherlock Holmes
you wouldn't grieve.
It is Tamura Reiko, but...
You'll never understand.
Seriously, what am I doing,
Are they here?!
Tell me his name!
He suffered pain...
In other words,
What are we parasites to humans,
What are you talking about?!
He is indeed one of our "fragile" kind that I created through experimentation,
Wait, so are they all cops?!
I would not have felt this much conviction.
At this distance,
I'll take full responsibility!
Please stop!
You were correct.
Shinichi!
There's no way Izumi-kun is there!
Why won't she retaliate?
Stop!
I'd just accept it.
I recently imitated a human,
It felt... rather pleasant...
Are you all right, Shinichi?!
Did any oil get on you?!
Meet the one who opened that hole again.
Izumi-kun...
But...
Waiting Room
But I don't think he has that ability the detectives are hoping for.
Ugh... So it's only him, after all?
Shut your trap!
No matter what they ask me,
I will keep Migi's existence hidden.
Someone with the same ability as you.
And soundproof to boot.
Well... He is not a parasite.
but I doubt he has the same ability as me.
are probably all frauds.
Th-There's no mistake!
What?
Yes?
It's not like I think I'm all that special.
I sure played around...
Even I thought it'd be dangerous.
I'd never...
Don't yell right into my ear.
I told you I just imagined it.
Um, Hirama-san?
Just thinking back gives me chills,
He's been assigned to command the ground forces during the operation
They are not a flock of sheep who can be herded by dogs.
This is not intended to be a manhunt,
but an extermination of pests.
Three mangled bodies were found in a city construction site,
Now that a parasite task force agency has been created,
I've always wanted to tell you this.
You're never giving it all you've got!
Hup!
I'm 99.9 percent certain,
Why is it always him?
He seems to be a high school student.
Outer Riot Police Unit
But should we suddenly be exposed to fire,
it should unbalance him greatly.
Commence operation.
Mutsuki and Kisaragi squads are to rendezvous in the main entrance hall.
Minazuki squad, neutralize the "foxes."
Are there any?
Hirokawa is the key.
What was she about to say about him?
Please prioritize children and elderly,
No hits.
Bring the next seven.
Wasn't it gunshots?
We had a town meeting planned today.
I won't run.
with all these cops around?
All right, fine.
Hey, Migi.
Wait, stop!
How...
Shoot him now!
Huh?
Please calm down!
Stand without permission and we'll shoot to kill!
will join my Shingetsu Squad to clean up the rest of the building.
Hey.
The killer will come with me.
You should be able to get through the cordon easily enough.
Good question.
while en route to the city council wing.
You're a killer, too.
Don't worry.
just shoot anyone you find.
We are merely a life form that cannot survive on its own.
What'd be the point of having you at the rear?
I'm not one of them!
Hey! Uragami!
Y-You saw him, didn't you?!
What?!
I'll give you another thirty seconds to wrap things up.
Understood.
That's enough.
Ew, a molester.
Looks like they've chosen the winner of the Kayama Fantasy Literature Award.
It's about a guy who gained the ability to talk to reptiles.
This makes 84.
Mincemeat Murders?
I don't think so.
Right here.
60 meters.
Good morning, everyone.
It's her.
In addition, Yamamoto-sensei will become the new homeroom teacher
I hope you've all read up on the rules.
Why are you putting her on a pedestal?
She's here!
What's wrong?
I'm jealous!
Hey, there's a babe right here.
What are you talking about?!
You're awake now?
Can you make time to meet after school today?
I am curious about you.
You are the first case of this nature I have come across.
Well, that's all I wanted to say.
Yes, I am counseling some students.
He doesn't have a name.
Man-eating monsters.
That's all there is.
Why must you do that, Shinichi?
Where'd you go?
Hold it!
He just neutralized three obstacles.
There is an intruder in the building!
He's optimistic about his chances and lacks forethought.
He's not at all like Tamiya Ryoko.
Tamiya-sensei!
Don't push. Stay in line and keep moving.
Fight?
Besides, we currently have the advantage.
Hey, who've you been talking to?
How many people do you intend to kill?
You sacrifice other lives so that your own life can continue.
What are you doing?
Stay in line!
and I'm a morally upright high school student.
He's one.
Is that true?
"My" weapon?
How?
Well, let's try it out.
He's coming, Shinichi.
Hello, everyone.
Yayoi Squad has made contact with Hirokawa.
in a word, culling.
And that our existence is of such great importance
Hmph.
What is it?
We will rendezvous with the Minazuki Squad
and head for the council wing.
he's sure to break the cordon.
Fire!
Fight smarter.
Fire.
Shit, that agility of his...
deflecting gunshots head-on is not without risk.
I'm just a wild organism.
A flamethrower, huh...
I see.
"Forward"?
There is too much interference,
Someone's head just fell from the sky!
Will Gotou come for us?
We should get help.
Dad, I might have to say goodbye soon.
Hey, why don't we run somewhere far away?
Migi?!
Huh?
I can tell because I like them, too.
You're a strange guy, Izumi-kun.
You must be kidding.
Is this the time to whine about it?
Go where?
All right, stop.
What?
They're above...
If there is a protracted fight, I will shrivel up and die.
But that means even Gotou is unlikely to anticipate our strategy.
Where is the human boy?
If only I can find and destroy the body, I'll win.
If I am to decapitate Gotou when his power and speed far surpasses my own...
Not deep enough!
But...
Don't come any closer!
yet it's all eclipsed by the feeling that I'm so alone.
Who's there?!
This injury wasn't from a fair fight, was it? You were bullied.
The cut's pretty deep.
I didn't expect so much kindness from a complete stranger.
I couldn't possibly...
I don't have any nephews, either.
Sorry for making you help with the shopping.
but they're no-shows when we do keep watch
she'd stop me with a machine gun barrage of conversation.
About why I lost my right arm...
To save my life, he...
I can't even hope to come close to him in any way.
A friend?
What does this friend look like?
Then I can't help you.
There are way too many strange things happening lately.
and now, murder.
What?!
Outsiders like him?
It was at least three meters tall!
It had more than three eyes, too!
It has to be!
So it happened around here?
Th-That's right.
The Mincemeat Murders?
A bunch of hunters are going to get together tomorrow,
Hunting rifles won't be enough to take him down.
You know the monster?
Huh?
I brought him here!
Run if it's only to save your own life.
Mitsuyo-san, I haven't done everything I can just yet!
Don't give up, no matter what,
became even more adept at blending into human society.
Like Tamura Reiko before them, some gradually altered their diet
Migi, you never change.
I think I'll go to sleep.
You're always going to sleep anyway.
It's a different kind of sleep.
but I also became capable of pursuing many lines of thoughts in parallel.
What? I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Even supposing that humans, who technically share the same structure,
Well, I should get going.
Wait! How am I supposed to fight parasites by myself, if they show up?
Wait!
I'd like you to have forgotten about me along with this dream.
I've been left behind.
Nothing's happened lately.
In the end,
Was I imagining it?
This can't be happening!
Yeah.
I won't kill you until later.
Can you let her go?
Is there something you want?
It's only a matter of time before I'll be hanged.
I thought I'd ask for an answer that wouldn't come from a human.
But what about me? What do you think I am?
It's because we tried to stop all of a sudden
Be honest, like me.
Don't...
Compared to Gotou, you're spun glass,
Go call the cops, kid.
That's right, I'm fast!
was suddenly dead.
An organism with time to spare in their hearts...
I forgot to tell you before,
Three, he says.
You've only cut off your escape route.
Without total control over that body, you cannot win.
we will lose.
That is our advantage.
I will be defense and you will be offense.
Trust Migi.
His defense is impeccable.
He got an artery close to the heart.
I'm going to be killed by a human?
I haven't heard any reports of murders in her vicinity,
Regarding the fact that you are... uh, expecting...
and you can't even say who the father is?
I hope it's not that you don't know who the father is,
What are you talking about?
Like I said, what are you talking about?
What will you do with it?
I got a call from your school, so I rushed over!
She must be Tamiya Ryoko's mother.
Where is Ryoko?!
What's the matter?!
What are you doing?!
Mobility?
Wait a minute, are you going to take over my head?
I told you, I can't do that.
Now that I've matured without eating a brain,
can technically swap heads?
But isn't that risky?
That's just what it looks like on the surface.
Yeah.
I shouldn't need to remind you, but...
It would only be natural for him to be keeping a few secrets from us.
N-No.
Then I guess I shouldn't have been so against it.
I'll be down in a bit.
Excuse me.
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.
So, when do you leave?
Shinichi.
I... I thought I'd be lonely.
But when I talked to my friends about it, they laughed at me.
"The Stranger."
Then let's go a little farther.
C'mon.
fuse, and regenerate.
Move...
because your body wanted more sleep.
at the psychological level.
is altruism:
The human psyche?
Not yet.
but he won't tell me.
So you have a girlfriend.
He's not normal, is he?
That's uncalled for.
Don't be such a poser.
But you can go home.
Stop it!
the one on her right is a 13, and the two on her left are 14 and 12.
What's your point in telling me this now?
Animals avoid fights they cannot win.
That's the difference between us.
Shut your damn mouth!
Damn.
You're right.
You're cool.
Though weak, it appears she has the ability to sense
Your mother made nutritionally balanced meals.
Nobuko's...
Dad!
our next stop as we go along.
This is all your fault.
I did not say it'd be fine.
Shut up!
I can't face it unarmed.
I should've told you about him earlier,
The right hand, huh?
I'll tell you everything I've been hiding from you,
You'll follow in a matter of minutes.
i1There's no time to lose.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do.
i1How did she find our address?
i1In their luggage,
You seem really troubled.
Has my wife's body been found?
your wife returned alone to the hotel after 9:00 PM.
Apparently, I had a nightmare
i1How can you say all this, Dad?!
but hang in there for just a little longer.
i1Tell him what kind of creature killed Mom!
But you can't get a good night's rest here.
i1Maybe this is my chance to reveal him.
Will it be just you staying here?
Um, your meal's ready for you downstairs.
i1I can sense people really easily.
i1I have to use my own eyes to keep watch.
Confirm what?!
Yes.
I told you to wait,
i1That's her!
What is it, Migi?
Huh, now this is pretty unusual.
Just the hand, huh?
H-How is that a human brain?!
and perhaps down to his chest is where...
But I didn't have the guts to actually kill myself.
Your right hand should have some recollection of this, too.
The host is not breathing.
I merged with his body as it approached a near-death state,
I see.
I wasn't sure what kind of monster I'd see.
What's the story behind your right hand?
Where'd he go?
I mean, you're the first person like me I've ever met!
to the point that we will become incapable of thought, much less rejoining the others.
so my fragments scattered throughout your body.
What the...
Huh?
Huh?
she'll attack, no matter what you tell her!
What?
Get out of there!
Shinichi, I'm detecting one parasite.
Hurry up!
Th-This is the best I can do!
Shinichi-kun and Migi will be here soon.
I can't stay awake any longer...
I can leave you this.
the human that you reside in is sluggish.
I guessed... as much...
His right hand's signal is weak.
The only one in the world who could understand!
I'll kill you!
Why are you also alive?
Okay.
Goodbye.
I hope you'll understand when I say... Um, how should I put this...
No, it all happened so fast.
Shinichi?
It's him.
Then I believe I'll ask you to do this.
Yo.
Kana.
"Him"?
That poser called Izumi or whatever.
Hey, Izumi!
I have to meet up with someone.
Don't.
Izumi-kun!
What about you?
I'm not hungry.
Well, like...
When someone who used to handle your meals
Since Migi's cells scattered throughout my body,
my senses have become very acute.
What's wrong?
Izumi-kun...
I see.
Shinichi.
What should we do?
It may not be our enemy.
It's coming.
Why are you at school?
You're interfering.
I think it's a joint session between our classes.
I'm jealous.
But Izumi-kun's with Satomi, right?
of harming you, or anyone around you at this school, for that matter.
You expect me to believe you?
However, I am only inclined to believe half of what you're saying.
What's going on?
Shinichi, I'm going to sleep.
If he's really thinking about coexistence with humans,
They're merciless!
I-It's okay.
Let me go!
I just want to talk to you for a bit.
If anything happens to anyone I know,
I'll kill you first.
I mean, whatever you're sensing
S-Sure, I am, too.
I know.
Shinichi.
What's with him?
so I went easy on you.
Oh, right... Sorry.
I was so tense, I didn't notice anything going on that day.
Why can't we go public?
In any event,
Yes, it was just like this.
What is the purpose of our existence?
Did your visitors leave?
for his expert opinion on when to brush your tee
Murano!
What, Migi?
I believe I said I'd end you,
Izumi?
Did his right hand help him?
You're the leader here, aren't you?
If talking won't resolve matters,
We'll lose if we try to fight him.
That's none of your business anymore.
And your thought processes are quite logical.
You're just saying whatever sounds good.
Maybe?
If necessary,
Where's he going?
If...
Shinichi.
Tachikawa...
Something's not right.
Is this really Shimada?
What's that you're wearing on top of your head?
For now, let's evacuate with the others.
Is Sasaki okay?
He looks more dangerous than whatever's going on.
Don't tell me... Murano...
My heart's breaking...
You're fine.
I can't...
Migi, how far are we from Shimada?
I'm going to jump one more time!
It should be safe here.
Under the circumstances, they will win.
Damn it!
"Fault"?
I think we should finish this.
Yeah.
There's also Tamiya Ryoko and A.
One Week After Student Massacre
Police have found his identity to be forged.
Even if they did show it,
Crime and Punishment
I don't necessarily mean revealing the parasites' existence,
It's likely made possible by compounds similar to polyethylene glycols,
they may writhe out of survival instinct,
But what if they wear wigs?
Murano...
Izumi-kun.
How is Tachikawa?
Yeah...
Yeah, I guess it was an adrenaline rush or something...
Sure.
BLACK DOGGY HOUSE 1ST YEAR LEADER ROMIO INUZUKA
No.
It's a showdown between the leaders of Black Doggies and White Cats!
I cannot look away
It brings the two of us together
With only courage to overcome these obstacles
Then die!
-Inuzuka! -I do not require protection.
-The White Cats' prefect? -We're in for it.
Then I'll have no choice but to contact the Black Doggy's representative prefect.
We've been quarreling since elementary school.
-Stupid Inuzuka! -You're a girl, you think you can win?
How can I get her attention?
How manly! Take me!
But if I fail I couldn't show my face on the grounds again!
That's why I can't afford to be underestimated by anyone.
They were right. You are weak.
It won't help your allies when they're in trouble.
If you're a White Cat, hold yourself to a higher standard.
That's right...
-Damn! I can't say it! -He ran away.
It'd be bad news if they saw who we are.
Pepper spray?
Maru, people are coming.
We've been waiting, Inuzuka.
Beyond the wall...
So it was a challenge after all...
I can't tell her it's because I love her.
To me, that's...
It may be selfish, but I think of you as a rival.
Teacher!
-That the Principality of West still has a noble class. -A Black Doggy boy at that.
You wanted me to go all out on you, right?
and hit you...
-How did you not notice, you airheaded girl? -Why would I notice that? We're enemies!
There's no way you would do something that ambitious on your own.
Please don't speak to me.
That's right, because people are around.
Hasuki?
The student rep suddenly forced his way into your room...
I'll show you how true love will feel
Our dreams without limits
Boarding School Juliet
Inuzuka, you usually don't talk about your brother at all.
You'll be under surveillance for a week.
I'd like you to take
They're done.
Please, allow me to be the poison tester--
Really? Thank goodness.
I can't imagine you practicing making cookies.
I'm sure you planned to give them to him on your birthday.
I'm sure he caused some trouble and is being punished as a result.
Whenever Airu administers punishment,
-It powered up! -It powered up!
To me, my brother was traumatizing.
Let's make a cake bigger than the school building!
Looks like his spirit's been completely broken.
I can't handle the student rep either.
I was surprised.
I thought you'd try to disobey the student rep,
I'm going to wash my face.
But to me...
We're to meet in front of the fountain at 11.
Before, my spirit would have been totally broken.
Brother. You're not asleep?
It seems you do possess the courage.
the good old days.
Then there's no way--
Let go of me.
In exchange,
I can be next to her. I can see her smile.
I can't move my body.
You didn't realize how irregular your existence was?
It's frustrating, but my voice can't reach him now.
Don't make that face.
Persia...
That's what I'd decided.
I'm so
As long as our relationship continues, Inuzuka will--
My passion so intense, my heart yearns
-Brother?! -It was even sag-resistant.
Sir! Yes, sir!
Next, the Persia marching band enters!
Besides, this year we--
-Inuzuka! -What the hell!
All I did was make her worry.
What? She's avoiding me.
I'm not going to kill you, just stop.
Damn it!
I see. I think I understand the situation.
Jeez, look at the shape you're in.
It's no use. He's not listening.
I don't want to go to school.
He's so high-maintenance.
Per?
Why are they still here?
These cookies...
But...
That was one heck of a day!
It was fun!
Your cuts will open again!
That way Per wouldn't have to be so wrought with worry.
Shut up! Don't say it twice!
Your birthday party is today.
We're here to celebrate your birthday.
-Our time is up whenever Airu decides to show up! -Let's go!
Yeah, that's a no.
-Pardon me, who are you? -It's Aby.
Hey, Aby, why are you glaring at me like that?
Her idiocy saved me.
Later.
Who are you?
I've acquired an interest in you.
So, I really wanted to meet you.
Representative.
Representative?
So, you were trying to trap me from the start?
I wanted to watch you for a bit longer, but...
I came to stop you.
I want to match the love you give
I vowed to change the world.
That's why I can't just give up here.

I'll admit it.
Oh, incredible! When did that happen?
He's gone. That's impossible.
Romio and Juliet
You did something that dangerous? That's insane!
That's why I came here.
You got everyone riled up, and got yourself hurt again...
Physical wounds will heal in time.
Whoa! Hey...
-Curse him and his weird getup. -It's not a weird getup!
The number one, most wild man in the world!
As a prefect,
-That wasn't cute! -He's harsh!
Damn. So, this year it's a draw?
Now, we retreat!
I'll be fine. Persia's watching.
I've just got to stay calm.
I've been thinking about it.
Very well, bring it out. Let's confirm it.
Back off?
You're in the White Cats House.
After overcoming all those obstacles...
Are they trying to dispel any doubts?
I would ask you stay out of it.
I've decided to fight you with all my strength.
Just make sure your aim is true.
I'm sorry. I was so relieved, I just...
What?
you can talk to me anytime.
They got lucky this time, but the future looks to be trying for the two of them.
However, that little riot of yours was the result of my careless endgame.
I'm reflecting on it as such.
Brother! I want to aim for prefecthood!
Inuzuka, should I lend a hand?
Isn't that...?
There you go again!
it's like we haven't progressed at all.
Loved Persia!
That tool!
Thank you very much.
I usually just get laughed at.
-Let go of me! -Those guys!
They sprayed graffiti on the White Cats' House.
Why did you do such a thing?
Big sis will take you on any time.
That's right...
Well, I was...
Going to co--
crushing the White Cats will be child's play.
Die!
This should make it clear.
Ouch. I gave it too much "oomph."
That voice... Inuzuka?
I'll just say this now, I didn't--
or were you saving me?
the same as being attacked. It stings.
-I don't think that at all! -You're lying!
The strength I'm aiming for...
That's why I couldn't say anything!
Say it one more time.
Wait, why are you crying?
Likewise.
...became secret lovers.
We are lovers, after all.
Persia is once again shining like the sun's rays, guiding us--
Inuzuka, if you need Hasuki's help, I'll back you up!
I wanted to know more about you.
If you've got no business with me, I'm heading back.
Good job today.
Father!
Everyone said they'd get revenge on Persia and went after her.
Guys, stop!
You scumbags.
Shall we settle things here, Black Dog?
Is that kind of thing just impossible at a school like this?
You have to show me that you can change the world.
Think you have the luxury of spacing out, dumb dog?
How could you?
Idiot, you'll hit us too--
You shouldn't dispose things in a lake.
How did you fix it? Alchemy?
Why are you angry? Wait!
Anyway, I'm hanging out with him.
Could it be Inuzuka swings that way?
Hasuki's on the ground over there.
I'm not depressed.
Who's this boy?
This is why I can't stand those Black Dog savages.
-Where should we go next? -Where do you want to go, Julio?
Zombie!
Julio!
No way.
Could you move that foot of yours?
You weren't mad?
Definition?
So, today's date was a big success.
Lady Persia!
Persia has come to fight Inuzuka in secret!
So, going a month without being found out--
Well...
You're such a bully!
The violent princess of the West.
It's fine. Let me out here.
Big news!
Welcome back, Lady Char!
-Oh, Scott. Long time no see. -Yes.
I see you haven't changed, Tyrant Princess of the West.
Just how are you going to make me listen?
It looked like Char flashed her chest for a second.
If you agree to my terms, I'll keep quiet.
I'm begging you. Right now, I know Touwa and the West don't get along.
That was...
It's not that I mind what you're doing and with whom.
That's no good! A dog has to act dog-like.
Give me an explanation, already.
-Normally, you'd be lynched without question. -That's right.
her head's clear.
She's got plenty of people who'd do her bidding.
I'll be late for dinner.
Even Persia gets worried.
During that time, I have to find something to blackmail her with.
I can't get in!
It's like we're back to the old days.
You're right.
-What is it? -I was asking about Char yesterday and...
No, that's not what--
For today, that is.
-Maru? -What's the problem?
-What about studying? -Shut up!
-Yes, ma'am! -I can't hear you! Where's your balls?
-What was that for? -I said no speaking without permission.
Why are you here?
Struggle to the utmost, you maggots.
I see.
Hey, Maru. Let's beat this kid up, after all.
Maru, why are you doing as he says?
-This is how you factor an equation. -That's unexpected.
-We weren't listening! -You fools!
so it was kind of fun.
-I haven't left the dorm grounds. -I know.
Next time you do something like this, I'll make you bungee jump from the roof with no rope.
It's not like that, she's a friend.
Hasuki isn't someone who'd start rumors.
-Maru. -Everyone's asleep.
I was hungry.
But...
Also...
That was close.
-Hey. -We're friends, aren't we?
If we jump ship or fall in love with a White Cat...
was wishful thinking on your part.
I was naive.
I didn't think she'd hate me this much.
This is the guys' hall.
Inuzuka!
Sorry for doing that without asking,
The reality is that I can't even convince one friend.
I know you can change anything.
Yeah. I've accepted it.
from the bottom of my heart.
Shut up.
Why?
And don't think I'm overlooking this.
-Did you guys have fun this week too? -Yes, ma'am!
Hey, Persia.
Bento?
-That wouldn't really be a big deal. -Are you sure?
Good grief.
If I don't hurry, class is going to start.
Who knew it'd be this hard.
I thought so!
You bastard!
It's my duty to be Lady Persia's shield.
But, I didn't want to disappoint you...
They're handmade cookies.
Just kidding!
The sports festival is nothing but a pain, huh?
No, Inuzuka already...
Black Doggies are lower than dirt!
-Then I'll ask Persia to dance... -Stupid dogs, stupid dogs, stupid dogs!
Won't you help the White Cats achieve another victory?
I'm not bragging, but I placed first in my class in the hottie contest.
What do you say?
Anyway.
-Dignitaries from Touwa and the West are coming? -Yeah.
Our height difference...
You ran all the way to the goal without noticing.
I said not to enter.
If Somali wins MVP, will Aby like her even more?

Let's go, everyone!
With only courage to overcome these obstacles
Come on, what's the big deal?
It's just...
Iron claw!
Amazing! I wish I could be like you.
Good job today.
Father!
Persia! Persia! Persia!
This time I do have something to say.
That's right!
But it's okay!
I might as well just...
It's mine.
I'm going home.
Help! Lady Persia!
Hasuki.
Let's go to Dahlia Park!
Let's take her to the infirmary.
It's my hand-me-down,
Art thou a fool?
Lady Persia, where are you?
His name's Julio.
He's never excited.
Damn it.
Can't you see we're busy?
Don't get in the way!
If you're looking for Julio, he just ran--
Where did she...?
-It can't be. -This date was the worst.
Yeah, a full day out!
He may be stupid,
but he's important to me.
As if!
A girl?
I just went to the restroom to take it off.
I'm discussing our date, of course.
Definition?
I like to think it's about learning more about each other.
Just running and running, so awkward and clumsy
Next time, Romio and Princess Char.
I'll secure that MVP title, and make Persia...
It's really too bad.
Why would I? Dumbass!
-That's right! -We can't allow Princess Char to tire herself!
What?
My, I couldn't let you do that.
Wait!
Attention, guys!
It's time.
Sorry about this, Persia.
This is largely thanks to the efforts of Persia and Somali.
The relay is entering the final phase!
But now...
Don't make such a fuss, Scott. I just tripped is all.
Persia was in trouble, and I couldn't help her at all.
I saw it.
The moment Somali stepped on Per's foot.
And Somali only does what Aby tells her.
What are those two doing?
Maru, it's started! We'll just have to go like this.
Hey! Don't put your head down!
But it's about time...
Now we'll just take down Inuzuka's unit.
The Black Doggies are completely outnumbered!
This is bad.
Think you have time to be distracted? I've got you!
Don't get cocky! I've assembled a team with outstanding physical prowess.
-What? -What's this?
-Two from Aby's unit fell! -Wait...
I will be chosen by the elites that everyone looks up to!
Not yet! It's not over yet!
lend me your strength.
She's acting strong.
Not to you or anyone else.
You're no longer the Black Doggy leader.
There's a jinx that makes the MVP and their dance partner a couple forever.
Anyway, you haven't forgotten, have you?
Your punishment.
Jinx? What's that?
Persia! Get out here!
Thank you!
We prefects have a duty to protect our boarding students.
Following this, we will have to enforce stricter dorm surveillance--
Rather, shouldn't we just strap a collar on that ultra-problematic child of yours, Romio Inuzuka?
Representative, you're not furthering the discussion. Please cease breathing at once.
I haven't had a fever since I was a lad.
If someone catches you--
So don't concern yourself.
What's that? Do I own such thing?
You're mistaken! I swear! That stuff doesn't interest me.
I'll get you some water and something to eat.
I'm asking what year in middle school you are. Are you deaf?
That's not what you said.
Well, damn.
Just who the hell are you?
Hey! Get back here!
I have to find somewhere to hide, it doesn't matter where!
Steam?
Was she so angry at me she left?
-Black Doggy House is scary! -What happened?
-You'd better not look over here. -I won't.
-You lecher. -I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.
It's not my fault! You're the one who got your clothes wet!
Oh, did I wake you up?
This fever is not from being sick.
Why? It's not really...
Are you interested?
You brats! Enough with the perverted interjections!
I wonder how they view the world?
There's food stands and fireworks.
We may be 14 years old, but we're second-year high schoolers.
Yeah, right, not to these punks.
Prefects?
If a prefect sets their sights on you, you'll start to lose lots of liberties.
Did they see our secret meeting?
I was...
-Are you really okay? -The ants, huh?
What's this?
What are you doing to my little sister?
-Sorry. Wait, are you two really twins? -What's that supposed to mean?
I can't wait.
We found you, Romio!
Nope.
Look at this.
I'm going home. You two have fun.
Maybe he just needs to meet a girl.
-Let's ride the merry-go-round! -Yeah, right!
We've searched the entire festival.
Stuff happened and now they're chasing me.
Please try to understand my dilemma of wanting to touch girls, but being unable to do so.
-That was quick! -I'll remember this!
Could it be you're scared to face me?
-What? -Just say so. Don't beat around the bush.
Persia, are you mad?
No. Not at all.
We didn't get to watch fireworks together, but I saw a softer side of you,
He's totally falling for me.
Give it more gusto!
Pearl Jam!
Now, let's go to Dahlia Street.
It's an errand. Even prefects can't do their jobs empty-handed.
-Char! -Why are you here, Inuzuka?
You're an eyesore, won't you get out of my sight?
Oh, Princess Char.
Hey! Leave my clothes--
You think I'm enjoying this?
What Persia really wants?
Imagine giving her something subpar.
So warm!
Don't speak to me.
I bet you don't even know what Persia wants.
Can you really even say you love her?
Persia doesn't talk much about herself.
Break up with her, yeah!
Break up with her!
Why did he have that?
I was going to tell Per if you had some kind of ulterior motive.
But I guess there's no chance of that.
-Wait up! -No!
Back then, no matter how greedy my request, no one would scold me.
and got the nickname "Tyrant Princess."
It's okay, Per is my friend!
Princess Char, right?
Lend a hand, would you?
I was happy just being by her side as her friend.
You'll just have to think of a present on your own.
An arrow message? From Persia?
I'll be waiting in the library. From Persia.
So, Inuzuka...
Oh, I see. Your birthday. I'd forgotten.
Here's your present, it's hell!
The party gets canceled.
Yeah...
I've been defeated.
And to think he would save me for her sake.
Romio.
Why?
-I know! Why don't you do that thing you always do. -But--
What's got you this scared?
Why would you have something like this?
That's news to me. Whose is that?
I'd expel you from the school.
Then we'll go with this...
If my doubts are alleviated, you'll be set free.
I'd like you to take
You withdrew from your social life, and practiced every day for this.
Really? Thank goodness.
Maybe I'll slip some sleeping pills into them.
Serves him right, doesn't it, Lady Persia?
Big sis. That's pretty forward of you.
It's just Airu is usually so coolheaded.
Whenever Airu administers punishment,
To the students, sure.
Yeah!
Get up.
The White Cats were causing a stir
Tell me.
I know you're worried about me.
What? Help you face off against Airu?!
want to help him get over that wall.
I can say happy birthday.
Inuzuka
walked that thorny path,
It's only because I yearned to be with you
Am I wrong?
Sir! Yes, sir!
Those Black Doggy barbarians are no match!
If Inuzuka shows up, we'll toss him right back out!
I've waited so long for Persia's birthday.
Are you fine with this?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go to school.
I can't tell what Persia's thinking.
It's all ours!
quite as straight-laced as you think.
I don't want to see him sad.
Help!
Look at that view, Inuzuka!
Hey, what's that?
It's so strong.
You look so distressed.
I didn't mean to put this on you.
Damn it. What am I doing?
That way Per wouldn't have to be so wrought with worry.
These cookies... No way...
but I also hate seeing you so down in the dumps.
Miss Persia!
If it gets rough, pull back!
The White Cats House isn't so weak that it could be besieged so easily.
The hell you are!
Somali, this guy is getting super jealous with you clinging to me like this.
Persia is above us.
I'm a White Cats House second-year, and the representative prefect , Cait Sith.
So, you were trying to trap me from the start?
I didn't expect the rep to shut me in here.
This time, I'll make it in time!
I refuse!
As expected, they're something else.
I'm no match for you as I am now. But just for now!
It was faint,
He's gone. That's impossible.
Even though I told you I didn't want you to get hurt over me.
As well as
the fact that I want to be by your side from now on.
We didn't even get a chance to pie Persia.
I'm going to search for Romio.
CUTENESS SHOWDOWN
-That wasn't cute! -He's harsh!
Seriously?
Have at thee, Inuzuka!
Now what?
Hey, fellas!
I'm just here throwing pies, that's all.
I've got this! Keep it up!
Is the person you've been colluding with...
I've been thinking about it.
Despite wearing your obedient disguise around me,
Me, collude with this man?
Back off?
You've got to be kidding, Inuzuka.
You shall duel with me.
Is Per really going to duel with real swords?
Don't be stupid! We can't do this!
I've decided to fight you with all my strength.
What about you, Romio Inuzuka?
I think that's enough.
Inuzuka's serious.
They'd never do something like that if they were lovers.
Come on, you guys, go home.
I'm glad you recognized my signal.
I'm sorry. I was so relieved, I just...
But... I've decided.
I'll start by changing this school.
This-- This is simply unheard of.
Don't be so loud!
My doubts about you are not completely gone.
Don't give up!
Forget it.
It's fine. Let me out here.
I cannot look away
Big news!
Princess Char has returned to school!
My glasses in space--
It's good to see you, Princess Char.
You're as doll-like as ever.
That's interesting.
Just how are you going to make me listen?
I mean-- What are you talking about?
I took a picture too.
If you agree to my terms, I'll keep quiet.
No matter how big her boobs are.
Goodness, you were slow.
What should we do, Maru?
Persia!
-This is-- -Again?
So, for now...
our anniversary can't be lonely, okay?
Yeah!
I wanted to see my doggy's face.
Are you mad?
Guess that means the Black Doggies are finished.
I'll make sure I pay you back with blackmail, just like you blackmailed me!
She desperately protected you.
2 DAYS UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY
She's got plenty of people who'd do her bidding.
She's enjoying tormenting me.
Actually, turn around.
But since she's returned, she's been somewhat cold.
Under the bed!
The only other place you could be hiding...
is the closet!
What would Persia think if she knew how many pictures you have of her? Well?
-You were jealous! -Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Persia has always been by my side.
She's my most treasured person!
-I'm coming in. -Just hold on!
I don't want Persia to find out about these feelings.
What's the problem? Let's talk here!
What are you talking about?
You're right.
Just running and running, so awkward and clumsy
-What is it? -I was asking about Char yesterday and...
You're at the age where you're interested in that stuff.
How? I fixed it, isn't it obvious?
I wouldn't just throw it away.
I was watching you with my hidden feelings from afar
Felt the wind
Romio and Hasuki
I am a pen!
-Yes, ma'am! -I can't hear you! Where's your balls?
-What was that for? -I said no speaking without permission.
And despite her looks, she's top doggy in her class.
If you sleep, you get clipped with specially made clips as a penalty.
Tests are all about how well you can cheat.
It's cooler if a man fights it out fair and square with everything he's got.
What? Yeah, right.
You'd better get serious.
-We weren't listening! -You fools!
What do you mean?
I thought you might be keeping secrets from me.
Does that really matter?
More importantly,
It's not for us, but Inuzuka. Am I wrong?
I just-- I...
This one?
Teach me too!
Also...
I thought she'd understand if I told her--
-Hey. -We're friends, aren't we?
Of course. That's why I told you my secret.
It's the Black Doggy code that we all agreed on.
It's Hasuki.
Hey, did you hear that weird sound over by the Black Doggies?
Don't worry about me.
Wait, Hasuki. It might be selfish, but hear me out.
Char knew about us.
I know you can change anything.
Yeah. I've accepted it.
wanting to be your friend,
Let's be friends.
Shut up.
Persia!
But how do I face her?
Yes, ma'am.
I want to match the love you give
-Did you guys have fun this week too? -Yes, ma'am!
I can hear my heartbeat
With only courage to overcome these obstacles
Boarding School Juliet
Inuzuka, say "Ah"!
Oh, no, Persia! The oil overheated and caught fire!
I left a spoon in there!
Persia?
I thought so!
-Hold it, you! -You won't catch me like that.
What in the--?
Hold on!
-If only time would stop right now. -Stop right there!
The moment I give up...
Come with me Scott. I'll make do with you as a plaything for today.
so I had the kitchen maid make that bento for me!
Don't do battle over me!
They're handmade cookies.
I burned them a little.
Holy--!
You can relax when you're around me, at least.
We've been running since morning.
Out of the way! I'm the one Hasuki will be wiping!
One hundred percent?
Dance with Inuzuka! Hey!
That's a vulgar song you sing!
I was thinking we finally join the two.
Once I win MVP at the sports festival, will you date me?
My apologies.
-Why's everyone so fired up about this? -Let's do our best!
So close! Persia's sweet scent...
Let's do this.
Anyway, you're pretty determined about this sports festival.
In the latter half of the matches, the points were even.
The other day?
-Inuzuka! -You...
I want to match the love you give
If Somali wins MVP, will Aby like her even more?
-What did he just say? -Your enunciation is as pitiful as ever.
Tosa, fight! Come on Maru, cheer them on.
We have as our anchor...
She's taking on the Black Doggies alone!
Take this, Princess! Glass spike trap!
What?
He's made up for last year's disgrace!
This really is tiring.
Meaning that if I get MVP, she'll tell my father about it.
Wait, so should I introduce myself to your mother?
Attention, guys!
It's hard to say which is the winner.
It appears Somali has come to the rescue.
You listening?
The match is now one last kick between Hasuki and Persia!
That's right!
But I have no proof. If they simply insist it was an accident...
It stings.
It stings!
I'm not crying.
-You're part of the horse. -The remaining house will claim victory!
Inuzuka is...
Black Doggies are in trouble!
-Can Inuzuka's unit continue like this? -We'll be just fine!
Persia came to cheer me on.
That'd be you. You took forever to get fired up.
Since I possess the very same one.
It's okay! Aby can't lose.
Your looks and intelligence are decided from birth.
I will be chosen by the elites that everyone looks up to!
Persia! Get out here!
If I don't take you down, I can't call it a complete victory against the White Cats!
We'll make our victory absolutely clear.
I want to support you

the fated showdown between Inuzuka and Persia begins!
In love with you
Not to you or anyone else.
Done in by a boob!
If Lady Persia asks me, it could come true!
Shaving time. Shall we?
Saying it like that doesn't make it cute!
-Pull yourself together. -Persia!
I'm sorry for before.
Wait, what about the after party?
But, the one I want to dance with...
to dance?
If the pain subsides, come watch the match.
is to discuss this year's sports festival.
This whole month, you've been uncharacteristically helpful.
You've got a fever?
Is that necessary? Get it together!
Inuzuka...
I mean...
BOOBS GONE WILD
What's that expression? It's new to Romio!
There's a festival coming up that's close to campus.
Found it! The Dining Hall!
Just who the hell are you?
-You'd better not look over here. -I won't.
Jeez, your clothes are so big!
Please don't think I'm an immodest girl!
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
It helps you sleep. My father would often sing it when I couldn't fall asleep.
Really? That seems pretty simplistic.
Thank you. For coming all the way here to nurse me.
Even if you're just returning a favor, I'm really happy.
Staying here any longer is dangerous. So...
The fever's back! Keep it together!
Well, as a prefect, I've got to keep my eye on him.
Your dream had suddenly become my dream
With everything I have
Why don't we get going, Teria?

And in that moment
A festival?
I need to wrap up this request for punishment I'm submitting to the school.
A festival?
Yeah, so...
But...
Then I'll see you when the time is right.
Festival date!
Who are you? Why were you in that tree?
Inuzuka!
Yeah, right, not to these punks.
If I can just pull the wool over their eyes, it'll be fine. I can do this.
Looks like I got away with it somehow.
Why does a Touwa citizen have a rosary?
Anyway, your panic tells me that there's some secret to this rosary.
It's starting!
Let's get there quick!
Teria.
Really?
He's making tons of merry!
You guys? You're still following me?
We're on patrol!
Nope.
-I didn't catch that. What? -Nothing.
Stuff happened and now they're chasing me.
Let's give up and go back to patrolling.
Please try to understand my dilemma of wanting to touch girls, but being unable to do so.
Oh, well, let's just give up.
I can't just let you leave after that.
You're leaning too far!
Don't treat us like kids! We're adults now!
Let's go.
I-- I didn't make it.
No. Not at all.
I mean, I did get to see a few things.
But, we've got Airu.
I confess all my love for you, I swear
There is a miraculous encounter
With only courage to overcome these obstacles
We are tied together by our strong determination Without anyone knowing
Just one more week until her birthday!
Now, let's go to Dahlia Street.
-Char! -Why are you here, Inuzuka?
You seem even more upset than usual.
I need to get out of this situation. But...
But I do have an escort!
What? Where is--
-That's just that student-- -What student?
what Per really wants.
Sure, sure.
It's a squall!
But I wonder what business he had at Dahlia Street.
I can hear the seams tearing!
Is it arousing you?
You can't be so selfish.
Oh, hey, bro. You look tough.
What the heck?
An even bigger idiot...
I was jealous of you.
One that would make Per the happiest.
I'll be waiting in the library. From Persia.
I have a request.
-Every year, you crash the party my dorm throws for me. -Happy birthday, Lady Persia.
I wonder how I'll have you make up for all my despair.
I said, a pair accessory.
Don't make me keep saying it!
I don't think so.
Okay. I can hardly wait.
I'll make sure it's a success!
I want to support you
Shoo!
your sisters will be here to protect you.
Really?
Ako-nee.
I-Idiots.
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Oh, after dinner and a shower were suggested... I accidentally said...
You've only seen Riko's... so unfair...
Or pure, perhaps?
See?inserted this, needs TLC -masatis fine-N
Really... Who's the one being a pervert?
Drink this first.
Stop it...
L-Lies!
It can't be helped...
This is for you.
Don't scare me.
It's fine.
A fool's mistake, eh?hard to tell if he means her, or himself here... for looking-N
Hey Kei-chan, hurry, hurry!
What's he called? Class D's Suminoe...
That's alright. Why are you here?
Keita.
T-That's... But...
I've said it before.
This makes them even greater girls.Changed girl to plural, assuming he's talking about both of them
Keita is going to marry Ako after all, right?
Even though you say that,
Kei-chan will always be...
Oww...
I suppose...
Work hard! There's still time.
Yes!
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm a tutor.
Hey, you're looking at me again.
You're just like me.
It's not something to laugh about.
Then how about Oyakodon?editor look it up on wikipedia
I love this type of rivalry!
Because the interior angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.math terms...what're they called? tony-san
It's already 2 a.m. Normally I'd be...The play on words here is hard to tell in english without letting people know this line is discussing time, not triangles. also, doesn't say already twice. The second line infers that it's 2 AM, and he'd already be sleepingAgain, same thing. I suggest using 2 A.M., it looks really weird as two A.M.
Let's work hard for a bit more.
I think I solve this by...
You don't remember anything?
Alright! Change of plans!
This is a special lesson.
The inside of my left leg says "look at."
Happily do something: "be glad to."
Hey, tell us, how good was the private lesson?
Is this how it feels?i'm guessing she's referring to H
You should be ready with History now, right?Something has got to change here, having 'all right' in the sentence, but then ending it with 'right?' is not fluid.-milky
Right now, I'm your teacher.
Tea-cher...
Ten questions!
Uh? He's doing alright.
I-Idiot! Why am I getting nervous too?
Kei-chan you can't!
Alright, that's enough. cock block, damn you
Ow...
Listen to me... Riko-nee.
A midnight snack.
Could it be?he can see through the cup. badass.
Wait a minute.
Granulated sugar and spices.
The condiments combine little by little when least expected.
Good morning, Kei-chan.
Don't interfere with my studies anymore!
No more kissing!
Work hard! Keita!
Maybe I should participate in a high school entrance exam too!
That's not possible.literally: You can't test...
Ah man, it must be nice to feel so good.
Sweet, sweet, sweet.
Damn it.
If it's like that, starting tonight,
Comprehension FailureBest GuessI just emailed my cousin for the exact meaning for this, if I get a response in time, i'll let you guys know.
In a key battle that made the Shimazu's family known to the entire world... changed position of line. -nt
But before I knew...I don't know when that started...
You actually made this...
This isn't kissing.
I'll take one more...
I-I'm nervous, I've never put on lipstick before.
Riko did this... Does she think I'm stupid!?HAHA kiip out -masat
Oh no, I think I feel really happy.
I never knew that you actually... liked sweets this much.
What are girls made of?
So...
This?
Riko-nee...
I'll give you a kiss.
Thank you.
Riko-neechan.
What was that for?!
We're siblings, remember?
They're just fantasies...
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Do you want to have dinner?
Me?
Only looking at Riko... It's not fair...
Don't fight about every little thing...
Keita didn't wanna look at your small boobs.
Two centimeters is a big difference.
Sorry, my hand slipped.
Kei-chan should be getting out of the bath any minute now.
Really... Who's being a pervert now?
I'm sorry Kei-chan.
Drink this first.
Kei-chan.
Keita.
That's something completely different from now!
Huh?
Keita...
L-Lies!
It can't be helped...
This is...
Don't scare me like that.
All the other third years are busy studying, but you still exercise in the mornings...
I don't have any interest in any of the other members.
turning down the recommendation to try to get into our high school yet...
Teacher!
OK...
Did you just say Riko-senpai?
What brings you here today?
Persistent buggers.
Keita.
Even if you guys like it, I don't!
Hey, Keita!
Keita?
I didn't listen to what you had to say and...
Oh this, if you substitute x equals 5 with 25 plus 5a equals 30, then...
Huh?
What is this?!
You! Don't agree with him!
Ako-nee.
Hold on!
Ouch...
That's the spirit, Kei-chan!
Are you making any progress with your studying?
Don't worry, I'm here for him.
You're not related by blood, remember?
Wait a minute! Are you saying I'm dumb because of genetics?
Nothing special really.
Well, how about I make an Oyako-don.
It can't be helped, I just taught you the wrong way.
W-What's that?
Of course. On my right breast, it says "be interested in."
"Look at."
"Being attracted to..."
Be... attracted... to...
He's a groper, a groper!
That Keita, he's got some nerve.
Well then...
Y-Yes.
Go ahead. If it's Kei-chan, I'll teach you anything.
Something like this, I guess.
You've got to pull it together!
C-Calm down... Calm down, Ako-nee!
When was the Tokugawa Bakufu abolished?
In 1573.
And the Kamakura Bakufu?
In 1333.
Tick... Tock...
I'm kind of excited.
There is just...
I-Idiot, why am I getting excited?
Don't hesitate, Kei-chan.
You mean...
Good for you, Kei-chan.
What do you think girls are made of?
U-Uh, well...
Mine is sweeter!
That's not true. You're the one who butted in.
WHAT?!
Ta-Da!
This is my homemade Chinese seafood hotpot.
Wow, this looks delicious!
With some onion, fried bread and pickled vegetables.
Thank you, Ako-nee!
That's so mean.
Something sweet, maybe...
That's right, they say the handmade ones taste the best.
What... is this?
Thanks.
It's so rowdy every night...
I made this during home-ec!
Huh? It's a chocolate banana, of course.
What is this all of a sudden? I don't understand any more...
Also...
But...
How did what happen?
I can't.
Not at all. It's just chocolate.
Yes, sweets.
Wait, Riko-nee...
I didn't know kissing could be this sweet.
This time I'll put some on your tongue, so stick it out.
Wait, Keita
Riko-nee.
That your entire body was sweet as chocolate...
That's really true.
Are you ok?
Well then...
Just normal sweets.
Oh, sweets!
The reason why we wanted to see Keita.
Keita sure is late, isn't he?
We've had something like this happen before.
Back when we just became middle schoolers.
Don't worry, they may be a bit big, but you'll grow into them in no time.
Well... men are supposed to stand alone sooner or later.
Why are these boys so persistent?
Why would I? I've got Kei-chan.
They really are the worst!
It was the same that time.
Yes...
Kei-chan, hurry up!
You can ask for something better, too.
Mikazuki.
Aren't people studying for entrance exams like that normally?
Another awful day.
I want to see him right now.
Riko-nee?
But, what are you two doing here?
We've been coming here every day since you started studying for the exams.
When it comes to these things, you two really are great sisters.
But Ako did say that she's been coming for a longer time than that.
And we've been really praying for you, that's not very cute of you.
We didn't have to worry about anyone and could just kiss him.
A god of love used to be enshrined here.
Why not?
Look, like this one.
And this, and that, that one there...
What's wrong, Keita?
Where are you going?
Keita!
That's what a man's romance is all about.
Ones with this kind of feel...
Huh?
Welcome back!
Isn't Kei-chan acting weird?
I smell a girl.
A perv...
Like in the nurse's office.
Or on the vaulting horse.
Maybe I have a cold?
Those guys... Spouting whatever crap they can think of...
It started raining.
Did you hear about the new trick that Ero-Demon is using?
He's not satisfied enough with his two older sisters, so if it's a cute girl then he's indiscriminate!
Like any sister would.
I'm about to burst.
Um...
Huh? I can't get it open.
Ah, don't...
Can you still hold it back?
I'll just close it.
"That"?
Slowly, ok?
What the hell are you doing?!
That Kei-chan...
U-Um...
Eroge.
All right, let's get to work.
Aren't they cute?
That's true, too.
You sound like a grandma.
But he's still a boy.
Could it be? Ako-san's love target is...
As a teacher, I have a responsibility to lead strayed students onto the right path.
Ahh, you can't!
Lately, we're being completely ignored...
Maybe we should try that, too.
Thinking only for themselves.
Ah...Does this really need TL? can we please rip these out? I mean if its in the beginning of the sentence, i can understand, but this as its own line???
Ako, what are you doing?
Right now... I really want to see Keita.
To people who don't know us, we look pretty suspicious, huh?
Everyone.
Ako... your face... is flushed.
Keita-senpai.
Just where do you think you are going?
Oh yeah... I'll go pray while I'm here.
We've been coming here everyday since you started preparing for your exams.
This side you two have... really makes you great sisters.
Before Keita was preparing for his entrance exams, she has been...
Eh? What's that? Where's your offering?
Being able to kiss Keita without anyone else minding.minding anyone else sounded... odd.
Not all of them...
Is that okay?
This one is too!
It's impossible for three people to get married in Japan!
Because... because...
You're saying that so casually.
Isn't it useless if I don't pass...
What's wrong?
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan!
I see...
It's been a while since we went shopping together.
What should we do?
Never mind that, just come up with something already.
Games?
That would be terrible.
Buying an Eroge...
Get real.
I'm a female warrior.
They're really noisy out there.
People's manners here have gotten really bad lately.
They're in need of some education. rephrase
No way... I guess.
What should I do?
Got the last one.
Anyway... This one isn't anything special.
You came just in in time.
What are you doing on the adult floor?
Y-Younger brother?!
You dropped it.
K-Kei-chan?
A relationship like this between brother and sister has no future.
The source of their delusions could very well be their younger brother.
But, Kei-chan is...
You have to pull yourself together.
What are you doing?!
I was so troubled by it that my sister said she'd buy it for me.
Leaving the Eroge aside, what about the thing with Keita?
Samurai code...
We are partly at fault as well...
Don't worry.
It was my performance that got you out of trouble, so you can't complain.
Like this.
What the hell are you guys doing?
If you're going to relax, shouldn't you be relaxing surrounded by your sisters in their high-leg bikinis?!
That's suspicious.
You think so?
But I'm a teacher. I can't just start gambling, or my reputation would...
Jeez... You guys are late.
Ah Kei-chan!
B-But it's my duty to guide those kids onto the right path.
A swimsuit should be practical in the first place.
Wait! They can see them!
Which means that... You're also...
You don't have to stare at them so much.
I don't need a swimsuit.
I'm sure they won't mind.
Are you talking about Mikazuki-chan?
That was dangerous.
Take this, you pervert!
Jeez, what are you doing, Kiryuu-sensei?
No wonder that she's so stubborn when it comes to love issues.
Sorry, my thoughts were elsewhere!
Well, we should get going.
Mikazuki-chan must have it rough, having Sensei as her sister.
Well, that might be...
I made a fool of myself again.
I guess even boys get worried about that after all.
There.
It really tickles my nose.
This actually doesn't feel all that bad.
Get these off for me.
Look here, your teacher's breasts are nice, right?
Sensei... No...
That's not true.
All right, now let's see how we could use "slut" in an example sentence.
Mix it all together
Sorry to keep you waiting,
You see, it's so crowded and so hot
Don't be so unreasonable,
I can't be in two places at once.
I came just because they invited me,
Come on! I said we're going over here!
Suminoe-kun!
No, I'm fine.
The time we went to a festival when we were little?
They're so cute!
Jeez... You always keep interrupting us at the good part!
I need to go to the bathroom.
B-But what about the festival? We've got to look for Ako-nee, too.
let's go!
This must be a rendezvous,
Mi-Mikazuki?
You too, Kei-chan.
But I can't go on any longer.
Kei-chan!
You really are an unreliable character.
Then, how about me?
Only "while we're at it?"
There are exam students all over the country.
I made it.
Thank you!
Great, it's katsudon!
I'm suddenly starting to feel like I'm totally going to be accepted somehow!
Just kidding!gj nixx Moshi
You know already, don't you?
I won't understand if you say "there".
But I remember it...
I feel like I'm going to lose myself.
Riko-nee looks kind of cute...
That's kinda...
Well, there's strength in numbers.
She can't be right...
I was just tricking you into telling me.
Let me have a look if you're so worried about it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No.
It's fine, Kei-chan.
I'm going to start.
How did it come down to this?
I haven't! I'm not like you!
I'm back.
Together with this, the contents are all ready.
Every piece of hair is important.
It's finished.
Listen up, the content of this charm will be our secret.
There is one thing you have to be careful about with this charm!
We want you to think of it as it were us and we want you to never let go of it, but...!
Yes, I understand.
Kei-chan!
It always felt breezy, but now...
I think you meant youthful inexperience.loads more literal: That's not it.
treat-ment.
What about his studies?!
I'm sorry.
Well, there's no use fretting over it.
What are you saying?
It's doesn't seem to be going down.
I was trying to take his cold.
It's just like that.
My head and body feels totally light!
You don't have to see me off.
We can't do that.
You'll be fine.
Hey, are you okay?!
E-Excuse me...
I'm going to do my best, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
So, how are you feeling?
You're talking about "that", right?
Okay?
But Ako-san,
He really got on top of things while we didn't notice.orig. He's always on top of things TLC'd .
Well, whatever.
I hope you pass without any problems.
And this is the problem I figured out together with Riko-nee.
No matter when or where.
I've managed to fill in everything.
Riko-nee?
I've got to say, I did a good job of holding back against these sisters.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
What can I say...?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
He worked so hard for it.
I'm getting so excited!
Well then, here we go.
The wind is coming from... this direction. So that means the lucky direction is...
He's so calm.
Ako-nee.
Don't worry. Since you and I share our happiness, you'll surely pass with flying colors!
Sliding, sliding...
It's a prep school that one of my relatives runs. If you're interested, let me know.
Get her to stop this foolishness at once.
Huh? Where's Kei-chan?
Isn't that right, Kanetsugu-sama?
You know, if you keep up that attitude, you're going to fail next year as well!
We were unable to read the atmosphere. And because of that, we caused you such problems.
Huh?
Kei-chan?
I'm gonna try my best to get into Tamahide High next year!
Keita.
Let's toast for next year!
Umm... Mikuni... Mikuni Miharu-san, was it?
Kenta!
This is...!
I was so surprised,
orig. We've send out the forms to both those who've passed and those who've been put on the waiting list.Those who have passed and been put on the waiting list for acceptance both will have their forms mailed.
Yes!
Su-Suminoe-kun.
A-And... about before, well...
W-Who's acting lovey-dovey?!
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Well, you see... after the ceremony, a bunch of juniors came up to me and... y'know.
You're awful, Keita-senpai!
Ako-senpai! Riko-senpai!
The one that looks the least popular would have to be the collar of his uniform.
How.. how could this happen?
orig. You don't have to be so angry, you were only talking about his buttons so I could only think of other parts of his uniform.Calm down! Since we were talking about buttons, I figured any of his clothing would work.
It doesn't seem like I have the right to refuse it, so let's just get it over with.
My goal is the prize I came up with: to be alone with Keita.
So, Keita, how does it feel? Finally graduating.
Aren't you planning on graduating after middle school too?!
Keita.
The school?
Don't!
Kei-chan...
I wonder if Keita will be happy with this?
Kei-chan, hurry up already!
But you told us you hadn't changed.
But you're a boy Keita, so one day you'll have to stand up for yourself.
I'm back.
Geez! Will you cut that out already?!
Ako-nee and Riko-nee are really innocent.
Drink this first.
Keita.
Just wait a minute!
That's something completely different from now!
It's already become like this.
Oh, Riko, why don't you take the trash from Kei-chan's room downstairs?
Don't smell it!
You're really full of energy.
Teacher!
Ako, this way.
Seriously, what are those two doing?
Really?!
Sorry...
I'm in a hurry!
Riko-senpai, please give one to me too!
I guess we did something unnecessary.
I didn't think about your feelings and said too much.
Right?
No! I don't really...
I don't want that!
...a spoiled little boy.
Kei-chan?
I realize that it's bad, but I just couldn't concentrate.
You have to get it together. If not, then you're not going to get accepted into high school!
Yes.
Ako-nee...
Come on, you were looking at me again.
Wait a minute! Are you saying I'm dumb because of genetics?
Kei-chan, are you listening?
Geez, if that's how you're going to play it...
Like... breasts and so on...
It's not like that!
That's because this is a special lesson.
Special?
I thought that you wouldn't forget if I teach you this way.
"being attracted to."
On my left thigh, it says "look at."
"F-Finally!"
Ah, good morning.
Did you cheat?
You don't get these grades just like that.
Y-Yes.
Just what kind of private lessons have you been getting?!
She must have taught you other things as well!
You did it, didn't you?
Rub, rub, it's ok, I'll rub you gently so it doesn't hurt.
Something like this, I guess.
Rub, rub...
Did you feel that?
What the hell am I thinking about?!
So, when did you get here?
You don't have to be so surprised.
But, I've been doing tests at school...
I'll give you a kiss.
I see... So you think that's a punishment game, huh?
I get it, then I'll just have to make it more like a punishment game.
I didn't mean that.
Tick... Tock...
This is a punishment game, so you have to get punished!
"Getting excited" my ass.
Don't hesitate, Kei-chan.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
Because this isn't a kiss.
Next time, Fascinating Sweets.
Mine is sweeter!
No, mine!
That's not true. You're the one who butted in.
WHAT?!
Ta-Da!
This is my homemade Chinese seafood hotpot.
That's so mean.
How wonderful!
Sweets!
From the start, you've got to give your enemy...
Give your enemy...
Home economics classs handmade cooking.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Why are you doing this?!
M-Mikazuki?
It doesn't matter... I'll just...
He's not here?
Kei-chan.
I've got to concentrate, concentrate!
Yeah, just chocolate.
Huh, what?
Oh, sweets!
Eh?
I was nervous... I've never put on lipstick.
Me neither.
The picture book we used to read when you were little?
Sweet... spot?!
Huh?! No way!
I don't care.
I just wanted a little more.
Oh, sweets!
That summer day when we first fell for a boy.
Nice angle!
No! It has to be about seeing through the bra. TLCdoes he say see through shirt or literally see through bra?
You don't have any interest in girls, other than Ako and Riko-senpai.
Welcome home.
You're annoying me.
For example...
Of course, but...TLCIs "but" better or "however"?
But?
A married couple's quarrel?
Oh my, what a youthful scene.
Idiot father.
Girls other than my sisters...
Kei-chan.
I have a feeling she's looking over here. Maybe she's still mad?
Even if there's a tiny chance...a tiny opening in a cute girl? Wow that keita is darn screwed -masat
Huh? Did she go home?
Nee-chan? This is bad.
Don't shake me!
Damn it!
I can't...
All of this is Mikuni's pee...drink it if you're so aroused! -masat
Already a third year and I actually wet myself in front of my classmate.
About peeing, I mean.
Who are you?
You shouldn't have followed up with that comment.
There's nothing we can do, he's at that age.
He can't just stick close to his sisters all the time.
That's the Chief of Police... no, wait, I mean incest.
And you're so popular, Riko.
But Keita is all alone.
Boys are so dirty!
They're violent and perverted.
Yeah.
Kei-chan, hurry up!
You're not getting away.
Where do you think you're going?
But come on.
I want to see him right now.
Kei-chan.
Almost, at least.
Thank you.
"Fail it! Fail it!"
I'm sorry.
Is it really okay for me to apply to the same school as they did?
Don't worry about it.
I'm next.
But we could just kiss him now, too.
Huh? Didn't you know?
You can't have a marriage with three people in Japan.
Because... Because I can't help it!
But that was just me growing up.
Everyone has to grow up sometime.
Are you all right with that, Ako-nee?
My sisters will...
Kei-chan?
I'm not going to hand over my sisters to some nobody.
Are you guys idiots?
Because you're on the winning team when it comes to sexual things.
Uh... I'm for big breasts!
Ones with this kind of feel...
Huh?
I'm home!
Accidents?
Not in a billion years even!
I need to just forget about it.
Even without those intentions, it just happens... Right, Keita?
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.
I couldn't keep a single thought inside my head...
It started raining.
That's...
Stop shaking me!
Kei-chan!
Mommy!
Someone left it open.
But it looks like it's a little bit too high up.
Hey, is your underwear all right?
I'm not hinting at anything weird.
That's the first step to adulthood.
Uneasiness at Akiba.
And if you use the Internet, you'll be able to find all kinds of uncensored stufffscx200-
But it seems like this dream will never become a reality.
Let's go, Ako!
You can do that?
It's got to be something to avoid the filter.
"Piss-mania."
"First-timer."
Games?
I used to play this a lot.
But I never managed to beat the fourth boss, no matter what I did.
Buying an Eroge...
That's so filthy!
I should have noticed...
Anyway, I'm going to take Kei-chan with me, so in the meantime...
But I don't want them to do that.
I'm a female warrior.
Ah, I'm sorryfscx200-
Wasn't that Kiryuu-sensei just now?
Which one should I take?
No, I got it first.
I'm buying that one!
What do you mean you're buying it?
S-Suminoe Ako-san?!
Kiryuu-sensei?
Who's this?
Thank you for taking care of my sisters.
So there's no problem at all!
In terms of morals and public opinion.
We love Kei-chan, that's all there is to it.
Last 3 copies left!
Anyway, let's just keep looking for him.
You can't keep going on like this.
You understand that, right?
I've found you, Onee-chan.
But...
Leaving the Eroge aside, what about the thing with Keita?
Should I bring your swimming trunks as well?
Toda is with them?
Then, you're staying home, right Riko?
Of course! That's my man, you're so loved!
Treating me like some festival float...
Keita.
Here you go. That will be 2500 yen.
What's up with these prices?
I won't be able to pay this month's rent!
You two both going to pick flowers or something?
Are you talking about Mikazuki-chan?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee, what happened?
Hey!
Sorry, my thoughts were elsewhere!
Suminoe-kun?
I'll wash the jersey and give it back to you.
Well, we should get going.
Isn't that what it means to be passionate about teaching?
That might be so, but if Kei-chan gets into our school...
What is this strange feeling of freedom?
It smells a little sour, which is actually good.
If I keep doing this...
as punishment...
But...
H-He'll probably forgive me.
That's not true.
You've got it all wrong, Sensei!
I read about it in a magazine.
How's your special summer course at the cram school going?
But you can still tell they're a little nervous.
You see, it's so crowded and so hot
It's just like the calm before the storm.
Kei-chan is going to the festival with me!
That won't do!
We could do that.
We want to have an unforgettable summer as well!
I have to get away before he...
Why am I getting all excited right now?
Kei-chan, do you want some too?
Nee-chan!
Like at these narrow places between the stalls...
Those are the Suminoe siblings.
Kiryuu Yuuzuki, ready for battle!
Isn't it sexy?
What's up with this summer festival?
Could it possibly be?
If I'll end up laughing or crying all counts on how hard I work this winter!
How about one from the Dazaifu temple?
Well then, we can go to the hot springs and Beppu and while we're at itfscx200-
I'm so glad.
Great, it's katsudon!
I'm suddenly starting to feel like I'm totally going to be accepted somehow!
Riko-nee?
Gosh...
Huh? That's why I said sorry...
What are you talking about?
Where's your foot touching me?
You'll figure it out soon enough.
I saw your balls and your pole.
I'm sorry...
Or do you think I'm joking?
...nothing.
Then why don't you get out of the kotatsu?
Or not.
You've done nothing but bother Keita. What are you going to do if he fails his exams?split
Don't say such stupid things.
Well, when it comes down to this, all I can do is ask the gods for help.
You sure collected a lot.
Well, there's strength in numbers.
I've calmed down, but there's still the problem at hand.
It's fine. It should get more powerful once we add mine.
I'll leave you to making the bag for the charm.
I'm going to start.
I don't have a lot of them.
What are you saying?
Jeez... You idiot!
Wait...!
I see.timing plox
It's not like that, I'm going to the bathroomtoilet to pull one out!
I finally understand that!
What's wrong?
Yes, I understand.
Please, please!
I'm off!
Ah... Jeez!
Well...
39.2 degrees.
I'm sorry, Keita.
That's why...
but you believe that's just a superstition, right?
This is just treatment. Add "just" if it sounds awkwrd
W-What is it?
If you watch out for careless mistakes, you'll definitely pass.
Honestly, thanks a lot!
I'm not worthy of having you guys...To dear Mr.Editing-kun, SUP?!nigger -Editing-kun
"Lo?"
What's this? I don't even... What was that all of a sudden...?
What's that? It's scary.
Keita-senpai!
before we start the exam, I would like to inform you about some warnings and the schedule.warnings?
That is love!
Ah, Kanetsugu-sama!
I'm going to do my best, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Let's just go back to our rooms and sleep.
Agreed.
Now all you have to do is take the exam.
You left it on top of your desk.
Even when it comes to these details. meh
Ako-nee,
But Ako-san,
Sleeping alone is kinda lonely.
Her cheeks are so soft.
W-Wait, don't start crying, Riko!
I'm already trying so hard to hold it in!
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
We sure did.
So will this look good if I put it here?
Hey...
You didn't forget anything, did you?
Calm down, you two.
orig. Why are you guys so worked up over the announcement of my test scores?What's with all the commotion? They're only announcing the results for my exams.
It's because my happy-lucky-wonderful-high-school-life with you depends on these announcements!on the result of these announcements - you could go as far as saying "It's because my life-long dream of a happy-go-lucky-wonderful-high-school-life with you is dependent on the results of this!"
No, me!
TL Note: A pun on the word Ochiru to fallfail.
Slide until your legs come off!...
We got in!
Eh? No way.
Where could he have gone?
We wanted to celebrate you passing the exams together.
That's a bit...
Cheers!
It's okay, I'll get it.
I was so surprised,
Suminoe-kun.
Yay!
Thank you, Ako-nee-chan.
What?!
Kei-chan, congratulations on passing your exam!
But before that... Riko, Keita and I...
I, too, will be a high school student this spring.
That's right! Our glamorous highschool life has only just begun!
No way he did.
Before?
What are you two acting so lovey-dovey about?
Whatever.
You even said that you'd save two for us.
No, not really.
I am so happy!
Each person writes down the thing they would like, and puts it at the bottom of the ladders.
O-Okay...
Now that everyone's written something, did we forget anything?
Who... who wrote this?
Ladder Lottery!
It doesn't seem like I have the right to refuse it, so let's just get it over with.
What the hell? Just what the hell is wrong with these people?
I'm sorry, I pass.
Besides, what's this censoredOO supposed to mean?
Good point...
I don't know where you're going after this, but I mean at your new school.
But I'll never forget that you brought me my letter of acceptance.
Mikuni Miharu, I hate to admit it, but I must accept you.
Stop. Where are you making me go?
The school?
Keita-senpai, I'll be taking your second button!
That's already gone!
Just for us.
an7fs44The years have passed quickly even in the garden of teaching
Just wait for me, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Wh-What's wrong?
Guess I don't have a choice.
Kei-chan.
be1Please dont cease that twinkling.
Fine. If I win, then you'll be skipping dinner tonight too.
The height of that girl you love...
And you're going after Ako-nee and Riko-nee on top of that?
The lines at the restroom made me late.
Pee... me back?
Wait!
Bring it on.
Look.
I can't hand this in!
Wait, please!
A-Anyway, get over here!
Second years?
What are you saying? Mikuni-san is still in high school!
probably fondles your boobs like this every day, right?
That's because you keep... don't, Suminoe-kun!
It's not "Suminoe-kun"!
No, nothing's wrong.
But...
Please hurry.
Go ahead. Be sure to measure at the top.
So we still measure 145 centimeters in height, huh?
It was all fun and games up to now.
Y... You're kidding!
I-I can't.
I have to do it.
A... bald spot!
Hey, give me that camera!
That's not what we're saying!
Keita, if it's boobs you want, I got two centimeters on her.
Um...
I can't wait!
If you have a PC, you can use the internet.
If you can make out the tiny differences, then you're a denizen of Akiba.
Up all night? Why?
What do we do?
Let's search with perverted words that the block doesn't catch.
Common words like "lewd" or "dirty" won't work.
Nikubou is referring to a ero manga series called Nikubou Shaseihen Anal Justice
Let's switch.
Blowjob, lesbian, effective fondling...
It's decided. We're getting an eroge!
Ero? What are you saying? Those are just drawings!
There's no difference in eroticism between 2D and 3D!
No, I'm sorry for not noticing.
Stop resisting.
I'm sorry...
Wait, does she have the same hobby?
Which one would be good...
No, I was! Get your hands off this right now.
So basically, you wanted it for yourself.
Younger brother!?
What are you guys thinking, doing perverted things between brother and sister!
Let's see you take three shots from my cannon!
Ahh My dear brother, your cannon is too big! I don't think I can take it
If we'd stepped in a little later, what would have happened?
Mikazuki, why are you...?
Thank you, Onee-chan. You bought the game for me.
an9Someone who tried to buy it
But I really, really wanted it, and when I was agonizing over it, my sister said she would buy it for me.
and being a teacher and all, she endured the embarrassment of going into the adult section for me.
Wait, that explains the eroge, but what about the thing with Keita?
You two get along well.
Geez, you are a teacher, but you cosplay and love eroge.split, please check time - Nanakotoadjusted time -masat
Another hundred.
He's our HONEY BOY, our SHY BOY and we'll split our love for him evenly
I love my brother so very much
I want his smile to be mine alone
While being blown back and forth by the wind
That's not good.
Not gonna happen. I'm just going to drop you off.
It'll take two hours to wash and dry your clothes, so what'll we do until then?
Maybe I can get your milk...
Your jokes go too far!
Are you going to make your guest drink that?
It's always been my dream to be alone in my room with my beloved Senpai, so I just...
Lemon tastes so nice and refreshing!
It practically clears my head of my lustful desires.
Who'd think a younger girl would be so scary?
What's with this?
So, which one do you go for? Ako-senpai or Riko-senpai?
Don't worry about it. I'll just take it off.
Teddy bear panties!
I'm just playing. It looks like you'll have to stop seducing me!
Sorry.
Crap, she'll see right through it!
Mikadzuki... are you...
I had a lot of trouble getting it since I forgot my umbrella.
You're the only one I can trust to get these otaku goods!
Nothing at all!
It's nothing to be ashamed of! You're also afscx200-
There's a lot of guys there.
A forbidden classroom love between a student and a teacher is a well-worn trope in eroges!
Keita-senpai must be reacting to our conversation.
What's that?
Um, there's something dripping.
Aren't we supposed to be the main characters?
Those who want us better put in their orders.
That's normal, I'm happy for you
really in love
Be there always, until the day we can meet again somewhere
STAR LIGHT twinkles more than it did yesterday
SHINE MY HEART, until I see you again
When I feel hurt, Ill make my heart
While I look up at your constellation
My sisters said they have a joint meeting
Oh, they do?
I caught you the other day with my precious little sister!
I thought Id smell a lot more semen, but strangely I dont.
He even has an imouto fetish?
Onii-chan!
How do you call this in any way healthy?
I might as well clean myself up for him.
Suminoe-kun?
I know, but...
Dummy.
S-Sensei...
This is... uh... not what you think!
W... Well...
Of course.
So why is she still on top of me?
I dont think it did...
But I just felt it throb.
Im terribly sorry for imposing like this.
Once youre done, do join us downstairs.
Hey, youre pressing too hard!
Honestly, you kids have it good these days!
At least I now know where youre coming from.
I guess its time to sleep.
But...
I do.
Keita-dono!
Yeah, but that means well be starring next time!
there were reports of lewd acts when the basketball team
And now that Rikos not around either...
What are you doing?
Kei-chan, youre always like this!
Dont blame me if we get all sweaty.
Sure!
I actually licked her sweaty armpit.
S-Sorry.
S-Sure thing.
Ako-nee, you washed away whats good about you down the drain!
Kei-chan!
I had a weird premonition, came home, and look at what I find!
To put a stop to your misconduct!
And you call yourself a student council member?
Nobody said you can go home!
Nooo!
Whats the problem?
This feels great.
And you did that in broad daylight?
Thats my...
What?
Hey! A little help?!
Anyway, I have to get going!
Heres Suminoe Ako!
Our lovey-dovey days with Kei-chan arent going to end anytime soon!
Caught ya!
I can do that too!
Ah! Keita-senpai!
Well, it wasn't raining this morning,
Your train of thought is always flattering...
B-But this is...
It turns out we're out of milk...
What a perverted... I mean, what a magnificent way of getting energy.
Hurry up please?
Keita-senpai, please stop!
Sorry.
Why did she come at such a good time?
Have a little tact...
What's the matter?
Could it be...
Here, hang them on my hanger okay?
Punishment?
You're too old fashioned, Onee-chan.
I see... so Kiryuu-sensei is a virgin...
But that has nothing to do with...
Ero-game? Fantasy?
Me?
Why should I be with Suminoe-kun...?
I-I'm going back now. Thanks for this.
Even from a child like me...
Why are you turning your back on me like you're embarrassed?
Does a peach even have nectar?
Welcome to Suminoe Hawaiian resort!
Too bad. I was so close...
I'll bring you to justice!
I want to make that smile of yours mine
Let me watch over your future
But at this rate-!
I'm going!
Was that Keita just now?
And we can't kiss.
How annoying.
But it seems he's been studying properly for the exams.
Poor Keita.
You can't just fish around in there!
That's kind of unhealthy as well, I think.
No no!
This is so perverted!
Because it's so perverted...
Just forget about it!
Impossible!
How? And there's a marker on this weird spot.
But why do we have to do it in his room?
Huh?!
Are you some perverted geezer?
Stop it! Riko, it's embarrassing...
Just like back then...
What's with this pleasant sound?!
That's not true!
To think that Keita's smell and the stimulus from down there would feel this good...
A little bit closer...
No... I can't think about anything else!
Keita!
No, don't stop!
And you don't seem to be satisfied in the first place.
My body has become so sensitive... It's feeling him... I can't stop anymore!
Y-Yeah...
T-That is...
This Anime DVD will be included with the KissXSis Volume 7 limited edition manga!
I'm happy that you have matured
so stealing a march on me is a no no
Yeah! And I, a freshman, get to oversee the second-years!
Whod ever throw that!
Ako, Riko-senpai!
I got something my sister requested.
Really?
But I cant go back yet without my sample...
Was I just...
THIS WILL NEVER COUNT AS A SAMPLE!
That cant be...!
Mikuni-san, could it be...
The other first-years finished a long time ago.
Wow, Mikuni-senpai, your boobs are amazingly large as usual.
Could it be that youre even bigger than my sister?
Does the level of ones schooling really affect breast size?
Why would you do this even though you already have me?
But mine aren't smaller!
Your face is flushed, your heart is racing...
Let me see down here too!
No! No-no-no... nothing at all!
But...
I wonder if Keita-senpai prefers them large...
Even though shes only in high school...
Now, now, take it.
Looks like another tie.
Fine. Whoever loses has to skip dinner tonight.
I-Impossible!
Or rather, no one would go along with that.
Both phrases are pronounced the same: fumouchitai
Impossible!
Pass.
It's a peeping tom!
Kei-chan, you...
I can help Kei-chan too!
I hear were going to the beach in the next episode!
Yes, I can only hope that Keita doesn't start any mischief again.
Seriously?
Thats right. Lets go!
Only 10 thousand copies will be made.
Keep up the good work, Keita-senpai.
Thanks for coming during summer break, even though you're busy studying for your exams.
Well, Toda says we absolutely have to go.
As I thought, they're meeting up in broad daylight.
This can't be!
As a sister and a teacher, I can't just let that happen!
One... adult ticket please!
Here you go. That will be 2500 yen.
Wait! They can see them!
Which means that... you're also...
The entrance fee is already painful enough... check time please, it started too early, reason: i took away a pointless line -Nanakoto
That was dangerous.
I made a fool of myself again.
It smells a little sour... but it's good.
Geez... What have you been looking at all this time?
It can't be helped.
Sensei.
Yuuzuki!
This part is important! Understand? An example of this is...
Hey, come and take a look. These are very cheap!
How... How is it? Does it feel good?
Well, I didn't really go there. I just heard it from my friend.
Kei-chan is going to the Summer Festival with me!
Don't be so reckless. I can't become two people!
N-Nothing really...
Let's have a taste of the sweetness of summer too!
Let's go! Relax, relax. relax sounds better than taking a break here - Nanakoto
Hey, I said this way!
This way is better, right?
No, this way.
I don't know...
I'm fine with sticky.
Did something like that happen?
It did happen!
So cute!
What are you doing?
Huh? We got separated again?
You don't remember?
About what happened at a Summer Festival when we were small...
It is a festival, right? In this context, "janai" is a question. EroYatsu
Yuuzuki did....
What is that?
I can't hold it in anymore.
Kei-chan?
OK! Let's do this!
Then what if I...
By the way Keita, aren't you going to get a charm?
A charm for passing exams. Like for Dazaifu.
Kei-chan, a late-night snack!
Ako, you...
It was my pleasure. Osamatsusama, found nothing definite on the internet, imagine it to mean that -Pipelynx
Ako-nee, it was delicious.
Are you okay, Riko-nee?
You did it on purpose.
Say it. Where is this?
I won't know with just "there".
I won't!
How am I going to...
Stop it already!
Yeah, doing this is totally disgraceful.
That... felt really good.
You don't want to? Or do you think it's a joke?
I can feel it...
Where did all these people come from?
I still have three to go, here! Look!
Then it's a battle between numbers and quality!
No way...
It's great that we were born as twins!
Even if you say that...
With this, the ingredients are complete.
What kind of humiliating thing have we made?
It's fine!
What is it?
Keita came down with a high fever just before the important exams.
Nope, even if my physical condition was perfect, I wouldn't be able to take it, 'cause I'm an idiot. I think this is me not knowing the plot, but he says "i won't take it" not "i can't take it". 
I'm sorry that I can't go to the same school.
Huh?
Don't get in my way.
The mother cat often cleans the body of a sick kitten, no?
That.
Tch, she caught on quick.
If his ears get dirty, his English listening skills might be handicapped. XXX in this case being his ear, they use hidahida, which I can't understand. hidahida could be the underside of the cap of a mushroom, but online also points to it being the labia. she also continues the line, saying 'kirei, kirei', which is like "clean, clean" Bee: Let's put ears then
No!
Stay still and leave it to me.
Yeah.
Keita, you idiot!
Ah, what's that? It's scary.
Yeah, somehow.
T-That is, well...
S-Suminoe Keita!i think there are some more S- that need to go here
he doesn't need to change right this minute.orig:There's nothing he promptly needs to accomplish.I think the line makes no sense, but that's probably because I don't know plot, and the teacher is crazy.
I forgot my exam voucher!
What should I do?
Ako...
Now you only need to take the test. See?
You two really are twins, even at times like these.
Keita.
Don't mind me. Sleeping alone would be lonely otherwise.
My sisters are with me...
He tried really hard. Kei-chan will definitely pass!
Next time, "Nitpicking a Good Day."
Congratulations!
I don't know, but somehow, it feels like I've had a very perverted dream.
Ako, how's the food going?
A little longer, I guess.
Th-That's true, but...
Yeah, my high school life with Keita.
Let's just leave that aside and go, both of you.
That's why you will definitely pass, without a doubt.
It will definitely come off!
TL Note: suberu - "to slide" or "to repeat another year of school"
Slide! Slide! If you want to feel good while sliding then... ????suberu in Japanese can mean both slide and repeat another year of school - Nanakoto
All the misfortune has been cleaned off.
Go, Keita.
I did it! I passed, Keita!
They really do work!
Why!
What's the problem, both of you? Did something happen?
Amazing! Amazing! You're amazing! You're amazing! - NeWbY
...did this...
I haven't eaten anything since this afternoon.
Congratulations for next year!
Cheers for next year!
Shirt: Congratulations
Yes.
Well, you see, Kenta is my dog...
This is the announcement for those who got the spare positions.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
Thank you,
We got over this dark exam lifestyle.
If Mikuni didn't bring me the certificate of passing,
Isn't it obvious? We're here to get your button.
Happy
OK, since it's like this...
T-Then...
Embarrassing hair? Riko said hazukashigemonaku means shameless but it also has the same sounding as no embarrassing hair pubic hair - Nanakoto
She seems to have more common sense than Ako-senpai when it comes to this.
Stop it.
T-That's right. Then let's change it to one minute.
You should find someone like that, too.
Although lots of weird things have happened between us, I'll forget them all.
You really saved me.
Well, Keita would be a splendid man, even back in the day.
Leaving that aside, Mum, let's do a graduation ceremony for me too. A graduation ceremony.
Somehow, I'm feeling sleepy.
The two of us, together...
Kei-chan.
Kei-chan...
This isn't about rivalry. There's only one of these so we don't have a choice!
Who is it...? Who is controlling me?
Please wait for me, Keita-senpai!
In the end, I couldn't tell him that we were going to the same high school.
In that case...
We'll hold hands, I guess.
You can. I'm sure of it.
You're a lucky guy, Keita, to have Ako-senpai and Riko-senpai as sisters.
Fantasies like that don't really happen.
Kei-chan!
Really...
Only looking at Riko... It's not fair...
We're exactly the same size!
Two centimeters is a big difference.
I'm gonna take this time to get his clothes.
Kei-chan's room.
Pervert.
R-Riko! When did you...?
W-What...?
It's your fault for sneaking away.
And you've always asked for this in the past.
Don't smell it!
This is...
Oh it's you, Mikazuki.
Wait for me!
Ako, this way.
I - Am - So - Happy!!
Riko-senpai, give me one too.
Keita.
It doesn't look like they're completely innocent either.
Riko-senpai, please give one to me too!
I have something important to do.
Why?
You know that if you two come here, it causes a huge riot?!
T-This is fine...
We worked so hard.
I've said it before.
Both your mom and me already had kids when we got remarried.
...a spoiled little boy.
Oh this, if you substitute x equals 5 with 25 plus 5a equals 30, then...
Huh?
Kei-chan?
I'm gonna do my best as well!
Damn it, I can't lose my focus!
I guess so.
Oh, right!
Nothing special really.
I'll be taking care of that!
I'm listening.
It's not like that!
Okay, let's change our strategy.
Of course. On my right breast, it says "be interested in."
I-I'm sorry.
"Being attracted to..."
Today you're studying history, right?
Let me see.
So instead of waking me up, you wanted to have some fun.
Who cares? More importantly, lets start studying!
Don't change the subject.
You get 10 questions. If you even get one of them wrong, you'll have to kiss me!
I didn't mean that.
Here we go, the first question:
I-It was... 1867.
And the Kamakura Bakufu?
Who was the last Shogun of the Muromachi Bakufu?
She's my sister!
But if it's somewhere where it can't be seen, you can do whatever you like.
Okay, that's as far as this goes.
That I couldn't help with...
Actually, Riko-nee, this is just part of that game.
That's why I told you to just leave Keita to me.
I did it, they went up!
You should try to have a bit more self-control!
TL Note: To "send the enemy salt" is a proverb that means to show humane treatment to one's enemy
Well whatever, let's just leave it at that.
It all seems like a dream about a distant country...
I've got a lot of problems of my own.
You can also do it like that, Senpai!
Guess I've got no choice.
Alright, are there any questions?
Huh?!
I see.
So it's not a kiss...
Not at all. It's just chocolate.
Ittadakimasu!
Got it. Another order of sweets coming right up.
Something like this, I think
It feels like my legs will give way at any moment.
Sitting like this is difficult, let's change our position.
So sweet and...
Hey, do you remember?
The picture book we used to read when you were little?
You two!
Just normal sweets.
It's a second helping.
Oh, sweets!
The grounds at sunset. Your serious look was so dazzling.
Next time: A Lover's Capabilities
A kiss for you.
Again, over there.
Yeah.
Hasn't it felt like it's been just the two of us lately?
You've become such splendid daughters.
Ako, do you have a brother complex?
And you're so popular, Riko.
If you showed some interest, they'd be lining up to be your boyfriend.
I got eight.
They're mean.
I really want to see Keita's face right now.
You can ask for something better, too.
Nooo, I told you, I'm not letting you get away!
I got to see him.
Don't worry about it.
Damn, why do you remember all the wrong stuff...
Awesome!
It was to get feelings to bloom and win someone's love.
Why not?
Look, like this one.
What's wrong, Keita?
So what are you going to do?
But we are...
No matter what you say, it's all about seeing through to the bra.
No, but still...
Kei-chan would never do something like that.
What's wrong with the three of you?
It's just a matter of being more manly...
W-What the hell are you talking about, you idiot of a father?
Those guys... Spouting whatever crap they can think of...
Completely different from my sisters'.
Dispel my lust.
But I don't even know her name.
He's not satisfied enough with his two older sisters, so if it's a cute girl then he's indiscriminate!
If you let your guard down for only a second...
I'm about to burst.
Did you see Kei-chan?
This door is way too strong.
Ah, don't...
Ok, I got it open.
Damn this...
"That"?
Get on.
Stop it.
But, it would be bad if you caught a cold, right?
Hell yeah!
Expectations at maximum.
Really now...
I'm home!
Not in a billion years even!
Mom, could you give me another cup of coffee?
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.
I didn't know she was the librarian.
She was looking over here... I wonder if she's still angry?
But I don't even know her name.
But... The timing...
Eh?!
I'm at my limit.
Ok, I got it open.
Ah! A bathroom!
This is bad!
This isn't the time to be embarrassed.
We can't just leave it like this.
Peeing myself,
I'll kill you, Suminoe-kun, and then I'll take my own life!
Uneasiness at Akiba.
Dad sure does know what he's doing.
Isn't that great? You don't have a PC yet.
If you had a PC, you could use the Internet.
Uncensored stuff?
If you want to hide a tree, you should do it in a forest, right?
Ako-nyan!
There's got to be a way to get around it and view those adult sites.
If you use use terms like "perverted" or "indecent"... Usually only the most common words are blocked, you see?
It's got to be something to avoid the filter.
How can you to get off from a drawing?
Eroges are the first step to adulthood.
Were you that dissatisfied, Riko-nee?
I get the feeling you guys are hiding something from me today.
C-Cosplay?
We have some costumes for couples as well.
More importantly, there's no way I can wear this.
This is it!
What are you doing here, buying these Eroge?
Y-You've got it all wrong.
Yeah! I was just looking into the contents of these games I keep hearing about, it's just research. TLC
How lucky, there's still one left.
What are you doing on the adult floor?
You must be... Suminoe Ako-san's...
I-I don't want to hear that from you who's out here buying Eroge.
In terms of morals and public opinion.
"The big-breasted sisters and their little brother."
The problem might be from your side, after all.
I'm going to put my life as a teacher on the line, in order to put you back on the right path.
Excuse me.
Cosplay?
Did my sister cause any trouble?
Kiryuu-sensei is Mikazuki-chan's sister?
But that's an Eroge.
Since there's no other way until I become an adult.
Well then, we better get going.
A sister you can rely on, huh?
That's not the problem.
I've really stiffened up.
That's suspicious.
Of course! That's my man, you're so loved!
But why is Mikazuki here?
T-This is...
B-But it's my duty to guide those kids onto the right path.
Here you go. That will be 2500 yen.
Wow, unbelievable!
I don't need a swimsuit.
Jeez. Don't say things like that!
Maybe a Peeping Tom?
Now, time for the finishing blow.
No, not there!
Weren't you doing more things than us when you were our age?
You don't mean...
Huh?
More importantly, you'll catch a cold if you don't change out of those clothes, Onee-chan.
It might be what?
It probably smells of sweat.
Be it good or bad, we didn't bring a change of clothes.
I should be used to it from school...
It really tickles my nose.
Indeed, being naked and all.
Naked?
Naked?!
Wearing a jersey while being naked feels great.
I can't stop myself anymore.
Oh, that won't do,
Sensei.
When did this happen?!
Oh my? Why am I naked?
This is bad! Really bad!
Together with some okra and fermented soy beans, you've got yourself a nice love triangle!
Right there, that feels great, Riko-nee.
How's your special summer course at the cram school going?
Is it already this late?
They seem to have calmed down.
That won't do!
Let us have one last look, at least!
My old yukata is kind of tight as well.
No, let's go over there!
How did this happen?
And since we're at a festival, we could... Right?
No, I'm fine.
They're at it again...
Kei-chan!
isn't that right, Kanetsugu-sama?!
I gave it my best.
Riko-nee.
Miss Mikoshi?
What do you think?
Aren't I just like a midsummer fairy?
Kei-chan!
You too, Keita.
I can't hold it any longer, I'll have to do it here.
Do... Don't look!!!
Huh? There's a talisman that works well for exams?
But if it was a charm that would only work for me or something, that would be something different.
And then dad would, he would...
A headband?
It's a victory headband that will only work on you, and help you succeed.
Thanks, Riko-nee.
It feels different ever since I've gotten the headband.
You bet! I'm doing this for Riko-nee as well!
Well you have to win at your exams, right? tlc? nx alt: Well, you need strength to beat your exams, right? or something instead of beat
Itadakimasu!I'm digging in! Moshi
Thanks for the meal.
Tell me, where is this?
Th... there...
Well, we did show each other our naked bodies in the bathroom before...
The feeling of your hand touching me down there.
Even now, really clearly...
Are you saying you won't?
I couldn't possibly be joking about something like this.
What?
I can feel it.
Well, when it comes down to this, all I can do is ask the gods for help.
I still need to visit at least three more today.
No I wouldn't!
Riko!!
I COULD ACTUALLY COUNT THEM!
Why are you laughing?!
But good for you, now you don't have to deal with this all on your own.
Riko!
What are you saying, Kei-chan?!
Wait...!
Wait, I don't want that!
I told you, it's fine!
Ako, don't you think you've become really perverted lately?
I see.timing plox
Actually, there is one thing I feel I should reflect upon. meh
How did we end up making such an embarrassing thing...
Stop that!
We made it ourselves.
Is that so?
What's wrong?
I've got it with me, look!
This way I'll get to show it off to everyone.
Obvious place...
A kiss to you.
It's alright.
I'll get better if I sleep enough.
...to get taken care of.
But you see...
Maybe you just don't love him enough.
Just relax.
Don't copy me!
I-Idiots!
My head and body feels totally light!
We have to at least say something before you go.TLC'd
You're the best sisters one could have.
Oh shoot, our fever's going to spike.
That's pretty cruel, faggotsguys.Aren't you guys going a little bit overboard?
S-S-S-Suminoe Keita?!
Regardless of any difficulties, I must do what needs to be done quickly.
E-Excuse me...
Attack!
Let's just go back to our rooms and sleep.
What am I doing to do?!
Hey!
So there's no problem anymore.
And here's yours, Riko-nee.
Riko-nee.
That isn't something a high school girl should say...TLC'd
She must be feeling timid because of the cold.
I really know this.
That's why...
S-Suminoe-kun took the test here, too?
I'm back!
You're both awake, aren't you?!
There's a lot of problems, but...
Stop it already!
Congratulations!
Take that!
It still looks a bit plain to me...
I just need more time...
Why?
You're wearing a different scarf today.
Yay, it came right off!
Oh, that's right! This morning a piece of my tea-stem was floating upright! TL Note: sign of good luck 
Sliding, sliding...
If you can't see it, it doesn't exist!
That should've gotten rid of the evil spirits. TLC: lit. It's a refreshing exorcism
From now on we'll be in the same school again, Ako-senpai!
Viva our high school days, Riko-senpai!
You can have all off these. They worked for me.
Oh, man! That's bad. How could I forget to put them up?
Why?!
What's wrong?
Huh?
You know, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Next year Banzai!
Let's toast for next year!
Coming...
Are you sure you want to do that here?
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
You'll catch a cold, Keita.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee... I did it, I really did it!
Passed...
He passed...
It really is.
How can I put this...
What about us?
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Keita-senpai, you big, gigantic dummy!
Third!
Ladder Lottery!
Next up is "The right to have Keita-senpai flip my skirt"?
Amida to kuji de,
Ladder Lottery!
Yeah, I wrote this one.
Yeah, that's right. Let's change it to one minute.
Good point...
Do you plan on doing anything, Suminoe-kun?
That's kind of rude to say, isn't it?
Mikuni Miharu, I hate to admit it, but I must accept you.
We've found ourselves a powerful rival, but I'm definitely not going to lose!
Kei-chan.
This is...
No, I've got to...
Keita-senpai, I'll be taking your second button!
Kei-chan...
I'll have to work hard again while wearing this.
Liars eventually become thieves, you know that, right?
B-But it's only for today.
Keita.
Welcome home, Kei-chan!
You've seen them, didn't you?
You shouldn't compete so lively with her over something like this...
Shut up!
Sheesh! You don't have to do that, just stir the pot so the stew doesn't burn.
I'll change clothes in the meantime.
It's not good to drink coke during the meal!
You are strange.
You're persistent!
God, what the hell are those two doing?!
He's being admired by his twin siblings. It has become quite the big rumor.
It's a annoying having such fanatic sisters!
It seems we did something unnecessary.
Ako-nee... Riko-nee...
Umm... Sorry! I didn't let you speak out...
You are my sisters. Got it?
He just pierced through us.
Don't spout out such shit!
I don't remember raising you up to become like this!
But I just can't concentrate on my studying...
Only you being the teacher is unfair!
Yes!
Yeah I know that...
Damn it! I won't lose!
Any progress on your studying?
Seems she's taking after me.
I love that kind of drama!
If it's that I will do it!
Kei-chan, are you listening?
I see...
Alright! I'm going to change my strategy!
With this, I thought you definitely wouldn't forget them!
Yes, that's the way.
Conditioned Reflex!
I just had Ako-nee tutoring me.
Rub...it?
What the heck am I thinking?
But there's no need to have a test at home...
Oh yeah, if you get the correct answers...
What are you talking about?
I'll give you ten questions!
Let's get started! Question one:
1573!
The Kamakura Shogunate?!
What? He's unexpectedly...
OK! That's enough!
This was a penalty game.
Girls are candy.
I'll give you a kiss.
I see. So girls are like candy, right? How great!
A dream?
It was you who interrupted!
Stop bashing into my studies for the exams already!
No, I will do it!
Eat it with your favorite toppings!
Something that makes you like: "Wow". Something that way!
Sweets!
Sweets!!
I could already tell... That it would turn out like this...
No, no, no, no!
You're one lucky guy, Keita.
If you arrive at home, with your sisters living under the same roof,
Shit! If it's like that, we will hold study sessions at your house every night starting today!
I give up.
TL Note: The Shimazu Clan Shimazu-shi were feudal lords, the battle of Sekigahara was in 1600
Not enough...
Kei-chan...
And now I...
A lipstick?
...that it couldn't possibly have been made by someone as clumsy as you...
Just like Ako's night meal...
Keita, you're in a high mood!
This must be Riko's doing! Trying to fool me...
Idiot!
The picture book we read together when we were small.
BAM
This is your seconds!
sss
The dazzling sweat scattering around...
Hey, Keita!
Mah mah mah! You look so good you two!
Are you forgetting that you have daughters that are in puberty as well?
Keita
That's kinda right...
You are not going to say "My brother is my number one", are you?
As a teacher it is my duty to save those pupils who are about to walk down the wrong path!
If you wanted to you could pick anyone you want!
How about trying to go out with someone?
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan... I think, that's the face of a boy...
Perhaps?
Kei-chan! Hurry!
Ako-nee! Riko-nee! Why are you here?
If you rank first, I'll give you a kiss!
Th-Thank you!
But it was Ako who insisted coming here fast.
Or rather, not necessarily...
Originally, this place's god is the god of love.
Let's cut that topic!
This one as well!
But even if they hit on me...
What are you talking about?
With someone I don't know...
Just you watch! I'll definitely get into Tamahide!
Boys are animals...
What should I do? Even if I run away, I can't escape!
Now that is has become like this, I will kill him and kill myself!
Young men's novel
Here Keita, Enjoy it!
Hey, what a cold attitude! Just play along!
D-Don't say talk nonsense! I do have a normal taste for girls!
It's true! Ehm...
I-I'm sorry...
But-
This is the smell of a lucky lecher.
Lecher?
I have to forget that...
What's going on with you three? A love quarrel?
Something like "Keita is unfaithful"?
Kei-chan!
Let's go!
Yes!
As his sister, right?
Hey!
Mikuni: I can't any longer...
No...!
I can't open it... What should we do?
That's not meant in a weird way, but wouldn't it be bad to catch a cold?
A, B, C...
We managed to escape!
Where?!
We give you a kiss!
Winning a PC in a Bingo-Lottery at his workplace...
But! There are still lots of dreams in Akiba left!
A-Ako-nyan?
Please take care of me, Master!
Yeah!
All the shops look the same way, we might get lost easily.
You're only concentrating on one category!
"Matsuba Kuzushi"! "Sailboat"! "Targeted Prostitute"!
Nothing works... I'm at my limit...
Yes, Keita mustn't come in contact with Ero-Games.
That would be the worst...
T-That's not true...
More importantly, if she sees me in this outfit...
However, I have to get a hold of the goods, I came for in the first place and withdraw!
THIS IS IT!
Ah... Y-Yes...
Suminoe... Riko?
Last one get...
Now that you mention it, earlier we saw her cosplaying...
This... is as far I can go...
She's our High School teacher.
Suminoe Ako's...
The lascivious twins open themselves to their younger brother - Golden Shower time until morning...
You dropped this.
Teacher Spirit
If I want to stop this, I have to take care of that stud horse first!
Yes!
In this shop, men put on an armor commanding women around.
No, this is not why we came here-!
Yes please!
Do you understand?
Like I said, love between siblings-!
A-Anyway,
The worst?
I'm going home!
Good day, Keita-senpai!
Hello, Ako and Riko-senpai!
I wanted to have it so badly...
About Keita...
Educational guidelines...?
Reliable sister huh?
I'll give you a kiss!
What should I do?
Damn! This is hard...I'm out of shape...
Showing off with your relaxed preparations for exams and flirting with your junior huh?
If we want a change of mood, it's gotta having your sisters in bikinis and high-leg leotard swimsuits around!
Don't you think, Keita?
You see, Toda insisted on going.
We're going directly there now, so could you...
Licentious rebellion - Older sisterX2
It's not that I want to read such things, got it?
Well, then you have no use for this.
What should I do?
Ah, here they come.
This attracting top...!
He! Amazing!
So you're wearing them as well...
What should I do, Kanetsugu-sama!
Too bad there's an unnecessary third wheel with us.
Are you alright?
Onee-chan!
"W-What" do you ask?
How rude! I'm still-
My bad! It wasn't on purpose!
Suminoe-kun?
Mikazuki-chan must have a hard time with a teacher as her sister.
I made a fool out of me again...
Why does it have such a faint tickling scent...?
The smell is quite strong near the armpits...
Naked?!
...the jersey...
No...
It has a spicy aroma...
The smell is wonderful...
together with his father Kanetoyo, followed Kagekatsu, but...
Why am I wearing a jersey?
Now now! This evening there will be a summer festival!
Next time: August always means THAT!
This is important! Got it? The model sentence for this word is-
How are the special courses of your prep school?
They're much easier to understand than the classes in school...
Doing this and that...
Because it's so thick, hot and sticky... And it's evening...
The only time a student can take a break is on that day!
What are you talking about? He will go with me!
This could be our solution.
Let's go and relax.
I'm going! I'm going! Now let go of me!
They invited me and I came without thinking...
Nee-chan!
Are you alright?
It's out.
Jeez, you always butt in when it's coming to the good part!
What are you talking about, Riko-nee...?
This is quite the far away place here, why are you bringing me here?
So you're still scared.
You were such a scaredy-cat.
But, what about the festival? And we have to look for Ako-nee.
What are you doing?!
Oh heaven, this must be the sincerity you bestowed upon me!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Kei-chan...
You two look awful!
No idea, I wonder why...
Wasn't it refreshing laughing that hard?
DO... DON'T!!!!
Pee...
Aim for Tamahide High School!
Only one more day left.
Alright! Let's do this!
Are you making progress with your studies?
But isn't it necessary for a student taking exams?
It's not like God could listen to every one of them!
Alright!
Do your best, Kei-chan.
Certain Victory
Yeah, I kind of get the fighting spirit! This is wonderful!
Getting all serious over this! You're still a kid!
Well... That's no good.
Tell me, where is this?
Just say it.
No! I'm going to show you that I'm not a kid.
No you didn't! That was just an accident!
Don't say stick!
Your sock is getting into me.
At least say that you will take responsibility.
Don't you want to? Or do you think this is a joke?
What is it?
To put it precisely, I can't leave...
This is to be expected before exams.
After this, I have to pray three more times today!
Here, look at this!
So many-
This is bad.
Aren't you looking up unnecessary things?
Of course I have some!!
"-that you can even count them"...
...can't be.
Ah, I'm feeling so refreshed...
Well then...
With such a small amount... will it have any effect?
After already saying he doesn't need one, what do you think Keita would do, if he actually received two of them?
Oh right! Why don't we have Keita pull them out for us?
...pull them out?
Even though you say that...
Don't know!
I got one!
Yes, but I'm okay now.
Oh, it's this late already...
If were making one, then we should hurry...
Kei-chan...
Aem... there's something I need to tell you...
Really? Wow...
Stop!!
so think about it as if it were us and treat it with respect.
Well OK, but...
We shouldn't have done this!
Next time: At last the real thing!!
Of all times, it had to be now...
A sick person's job is...
Yeah...
Ako-nee!
Or rather, while I'm standing here quietly, what the heck are you doing to the sick person?
Jeez... You don't love him enough for that!
OK? Feel at ease...
Hey, what are you doing?!
...would lick its ill child's fur clean, wouldn' t it?
I felt it...
S-Spare me that!
Seriously... It can't be helped then...
Alright!
Ako! Riko!
Senpai, fight!
Or rather, fail!
I will do my best, Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
It's not there! I forgot my admission ticket!
Hey, are you listening?
Kei-chan...
Keita...
Kei-chan...
I did my best until the end.
R-R-R-Riko...
It finally came,
Splendid!
Hey.
Erm that is well...
Calm down a little.
Isn't that mine?
It comes off it comes off!
O- Oh yeah! By the way, this morning my tea stalk was floating straight today!
I also found a four-leaf clover!
Go for it Kei-chan!
Don't tell me...
Erm well th- thi-
Congratulations!
Ehh! Can it be?
Ehh, where's Kei-chan?
Let's eat that.
I haven't eaten anything since this afternoon.
Cheers for next year!
Mikuni...
Is this perhaps...
I did it! I made it!
You didn't really study that hard for the exam, right?
Congratulations on your graduation.
No, I should be the one who... Erm.. that.. what was it?
What about us?
Ahh Senpai!
Isn't it obvious that we're here for Keita's button?
No it's mine!
Keita, you...
Happinessss...!
Err second.
My opinion is not being considered.
If I can avoid this, no matter what I get, I will get in a good mood with Kei-chan!
Could it be that...?
At this point in time, this shouldn't be able to bewitch Keita.
TL Note: hazukashigemonaku refers to doing things brazenlyshamelessly but hazukashige can also mean embarrassing pubic hair by separating the readings
My aim is the prize that I thought up: the right to be alone with Keita.
The last one remaining has good fortune right?
Do...?
This atmosphere is bad!
That's not true, we're siblings you know.
You've also graduated from middle school.
No... But...
Right...?
What am I hiding? It was around that time when your dad lost his virginity.
What is this?
Kei-chan's other graduation ceremony.
Keita...
Kei-chan...
What are you doing?
Ako, I could ask you the same thing, don't get in my way!
I don't want to.
Sto- Stop it, where do you intend to take me?
I don't have any more left!
At least just this one!
Kei-chan...
Please wait for me, Keita-senpai!
Ohhh iyaa
You're killing me! Ako-neechan!
Good morning, Kei-chan.
Look, it's such a nice day.
Furthermore, how can it be a greeting if you use your tongue like that!?
You'll be late if you don't hurry up.
Aww, but sleeping here feels so nice...
Oh, I forgot. A goodnight kiss.
You were fighting with Riko again, weren't you?
We don't need any explanations!
Even though you're my brother, I love you, Kei-chan!
Well, I'm just curious about it as their mother, you know.
With a stepbrother and his stepsisters, it's just like any other man and woman.
No, it's my sisters.
Oh man, imagine the elegant student council president going "I'll do anything you want me to."
Quit it with the weird fantasies, you idiots!
You're not going to sleep tonight.
Let us in, we'll be quiet.
Meanie.
For example, the rare fruit of stepsisters in love dangling in front of you.
In other words, we're asking if you want to do it.
No. I don't.
Repressing your desires is unhealthy.
Are you okay?
A desk? Why?
I'll do it too.
What are you doing, Ako!?
I wish I could be a calmer sister...
See, you made him mad again.
So hurry up and accept our care."care"
an8Here, you try it too, Ako. Don't be shy.
Ako, keep it together!
We'll do anything.
Even longer...
Next time on kisssis: The Animated Series...
With a gentle breeze blowing I searched for you again today
Don't... suck...
Good morning, Kei-chan.
Furthermore, how can it be a greeting if you use your tongue like that!?
Starting today, you have to get up early for morning classes, right?
What the hell do you think you're doing, Riko?
But I saw Keita sleeping so peacefully,
negao ni muchu muchuchu
aijou wo hanbunko
I'm sorry... it's my fault for not waking him up.
It was just some sisterly bonding.
Oh honey.
Oh my...
Furthermore, look at how tired he is! He must have been going at it pretty hard!
Oh man, imagine the elegant student council president going "I'll do anything you want me to."
No, no, imagine the gallant head prefect saying "Do whatever I tell you to."
I fail to see what's healthy about it.
Isn't that right? Hold your hands to your heart and think about it.
HELL NO!
Let us in, we'll be quiet.
I want to read in your room.
You can't! You'll bother me while I'm studying!
Get out of here.
Why? We'll be quiet.
She said it'd be fine in two or three days if I don't move it.
What are you doing?
I sent you some vibes.
Note: The word "shita" can mean both "tongue" and "down"
Kei-chan, just let me know if you need help with anything. I'll do whatever you want.
I wish I could be a calmer sister...
I said I could manage with one hand, but... ow... I can't.
Both of you, just get out of here!
That's embarrassing! I'm not doing that!
Wait...
Shit, my hand... I must have twisted it again.
Oh, another letter?
Those two might try something again if it stays like this.
What are you doing here?
Please?
Give me a break, Ako-neechan, Riko-neechan. I can't even think about the exams like this.
shine my heart kimi to mata deau made
When my heart hurts I fill it up with dreams, and keep on walking
Hold your memories close and step forward
kimi no seiza miagenagara ano egao o ukabeteru yo
And that plan is...
I'm getting excited just thinking about it...
Let me look over your future.
I'm melting!
We should use this chance to quickly closendeepen our relationship with Keita.
We should be grateful to Mom for giving us these free ticketswho gave us free stay tickets.
Hey, driver!
What do we do?
And what's more, they have extreme, erotic wood prints.
Oh wow, this is amazing!
S-S-S-Sorry!
If you make that kind of face...
Because you took us somewhere like that, the atmosphere's really tense, now.
Great!
Juice?
We need to set the mood, at least.
The water over here is sweet, too.
N-No way... not there...
Are you all right, Kei-chan?
Why did it have to turn out like this?!
Keita...
I won't!
This little bit that's touching my cheek...
It'd too bad though, it won't come out yet.
While you claim to be erotic, you seem really sensitive.
Keita...
Since it's all my fault, anyway.
I won't rely on weird drinks anymore!
kyou mo kimi wo sagashita
Starlight shines more brilliantly than yesterday
a smile spreads across my face.
That's right.
It will be included in the limited edition of volume eight of the comic.
be1I'm sorry!
be1Oh yeah, Kei-chan! You can't move, right?
be1That's what I just said!
be1Okay.
be1And also, Riko...
be1Something like telepathy between twins?
be1I added some stimulation.
be1Kei-chan, you'll have to use the train to get to the school you got recommended to, right?
be1because nothing beats being able to pass easily.
be1That was close!
be1Of course... being a blood related relative, you wouldn't understand...
be1Rather, Riko-neechan...
be1What are you doing, Riko?
be1That's why... I thought I should...
be1Geez... In the end, the only reason they do that is so that they won't lose to the other one...
be1Just what is it that you're reversing?
be1Riko! That...
be1Why are you wearing them?!
be1Hey!
be1Hey, what time do you think it is now?
be1I got them!
be1These are Kei-chan's!
be1Oh, there you are!
be1Oh, it's Ako-senpai!
be1Stop it, Ako-neechan! It's embarrassing!
be1Sempai, I was so lonely!
be1Y-You guys!
be1Kei-chan, I'm not doing this because you're my brother...
be1That's why, Kei-chan-
be1Do you think I'll believe a story like that?
be1Making a fool? But we were...
be1Huh?
be1We are...
be1Wha-
be1Ako-neechan, Riko-neechan!
be1That's why we felt so lonely...
be1Kei-chan, hang in there!
be1Hey! I want to rub on Kei-chan's thing too!
Oh? Even though you say that, you don't resist at all.
It's just morning wood!
And also, Riko...
Don't do that, Riko-neechan!
I'd rather not get all stressed out studying for entrance exams...
We're always ready...
Like I would ever!
It's better than being unmotivated and settling it all with a recommendation like you.
Your underwear is showing.
Riko-neechan...
What are you doing, Riko?
Geez.
It seems like I made Kei-chan mad.
Darn, it was my chance to get a step ahead of you.
It's your fault for attempting a sneak attack...
Those are Kei-chan's pants!
Just take them off, damn it!
Take them off now!
Someone who was wearing them shouldn't be calling me that!
Oh, there you are!
You were eating it yourself up until last year!
Yeah, it's absolutely fine.
Geez, is this what they call a brother complex?
I'm not a bro-con...
What was that?
My sisters and I are...
Wha-
So nobody should give a damn if I want to fuck them like crazy!
I was a little harsh back there...
...and you won't do reckless things like that anymore, right?
Secret.
I want to
That's amazing!
No, well, I came to wake Keita up too, but...
No sleeping!
So which one is it, Ako or Riko?which do you choose
You're children of former marriages.
Oh my, dear...
By the way, the highest odds are for not choosing either one and ending up with Daddy.
You were asleep almost the entire time during supplementary classes.
Be honest!
But it's a normal, healthy reaction for a male right?
What part of that was healthy?
Living under the same roof with two beautiful sisters...
So then, put your hands on your heart and think to yourself...
I won't let you sleep until the morning!
Let me in!
I'll be quiet!
But if we're already inside...
Flawless plan.
I don't care any more! Just let me study quietly for my entrance exams!
...that it was to get that bad imagination I had of my sisters out of my head.
so I just wished for your sprain to get well soon.
Ever since they confessed their love,
No it's undoubtfully serious.as in seriously messed up
They're my sisters!
What?
A peek.
Does it?
Oh no!
Oh, there!
Damn my hand...
I'm going home!
Keita!
This is Suminoe Ako.
You aren't thinking deeply enough Kei-chan.
Shout loud and it fixes everything!
Oh, I'm so thirsty.
What's happening?
She really started crawling...
Ah, Riko-nee, you regained conciousness.
I envy boys. They have their own pre- attached hoses so it's easy for them.
But Keita told me to sit down.
Please stop joking...
Then I'll pee in them now.
If you're okay with getting all wet with my pee,
Yes.
Weren't you going outside?
Do you remember back when we first met?
Hey, Riko-nee is that...
...r-really just pee?
K-Kei-chan?
I wonder what good thing happened to her.
Like I'd know.
Ako-nee...
Then I won't stop myself.
Will you share some of your cheerfulness with me?
K-Kei-
Huh?
Text Message: Suck only on my tongue, please
Wh-What a strange fetish!weird taste
At this rate we'll shrivel up as women!
Kei-chan!
Kei-chan!
He's been studying by himself the entire time.
Let's see...
Slutty Sisters X2!
Crap.
But... a threesome...?
It's a misunderstanding!
But he did have a book about incest and threesomes.
Should we try practicing?
I see...
But why does it feel like you're playing with me?
Anyway, according to this, next is...
Me and you, Ako.yes, grammar is bad, but she points to herself first and then Ako - 1569
Wh-What are you doing... making those dirty sounds?
It happening to me, too.
You're so dirty, Ako.
That's a really cute sound.
You...
That's... not true!
You're pretty perverted, Ako...
It just... feels so good!
You're... just... Kei-chan's replacement...
It feels good!
I thought so, too.
I almost came.
That's my perverted Ako-chan.
Kei-chan!
Let's cum together!
I'm going to cum!
I-I can't believe we did that...
Our main event will be with Keita.
I'm going to die from overwhelming lust.
N-No, I didn't!
Ako-nee!
But...
Huh?
I know.
-ED-
It's already time for school?
Kissing!
Goodbye.
I saw it, but what about it?
Don't they do that all the time?
Could this be...
That's it! There must be a used condom inside this! she said "that" instead of condom
Were you fantasizing?
I don't want that! Not that!
Get a what?
A sibling?
Perhaps I am, but our parents are abnormally close.
Get out of my head! Get out of my head!
Ouch...
Yeah, that felt good.
Come on, let's study.
I can't concentrate on studying because I can hear my parents having sex in the next room.
Once, I walked right into my parents while they were going at it.
Who's calling at this hour?
Where? Where?
I was so close to trying out new spots. semi-bs'ed
This is...
Keita.
You sure are greedy aren't you?
I'm going to sleep!
Try it? Try what?
Never mind that. But I said kissing was prohibited, didn't I?
Hmm?
But Keita, you also thought about "relieving" yourself, didn't you?
Actually, I want you to do it.
But like what Riko-nee said...
Riko-nee
I'm going to watch carefully, so go ahead and do it!
Hey!
If you don't know you're being watched, you won't be embarrassed, right?
I see...
Kei-chan,
This makes it fair, right?
Ako-nee, Riko-nee...
This is getting dangerous!
Somehow, I managed to hold out.
Hey, hey! You're always trying to make a move on him before me!
Yes that's right, I want to be like that with him forever!
Oh yeah, in the next OAD, we're the only female characters who appear.
Does that mean we're running out of material soon?
No! No! You can't do that without me!
We'll only produce as many as the pre-orders.
No matter how long time passes Kei-chan really is...
Idiots, we're siblings. There's no way something like that would happen.
Or would you like to take a bath?
Mine are 2 centimeters bigger.
Watch it! What are you trying to do?!
Kei-chan's room...
A pervert. There's a pervert here.
No... This isn't...
Jeez, what are they doing?
I'm sorry, Kei-chan.
That's okay, but it's really weird that you would mess up the food like this.
You can't drink cola for dinner. you can't?
We're the only ones in the house.
Kei-chan.
Ah, Kei-chan...
Okay.
You're really energetic, aren't you?
Flash
Today is Keita's important parent-teacher conference. they aren't his parents
For Kei-chan's sake, let's take this seriously!
Ako-sempai.
Ako, this way.
Ugh, you're annoying!
Maybe there's some truth to those rumors.
Riko-sempai, give me one right here please.
Even I didn't know what to do. Why didn't you get here earlier?
It was just like this the last time!
I'm sorry, Kei-chan.
This is...
Kei-chan.
Are you planning on rejecting their feelings?!
Huh?! But... But... the acceptance rate is only 50.
Next time: "A Lesson from the Two of Them."
Thanks Ako-neechan, Riko-neechan.
Ow...
Welcome back!
Or would you like to take a bath?
Why are you doing something so perverted?!
Well, since "something to eat" and "bath" came out, I just couldn't help saying that.
H I G H ! T A M A K I R I G O F O R I T !
Kei-chan's change of clothes...
Gasp! A pervert. There's a pervert here.
Jeez, what are they doing?
I'm sorry, Kei-chan.
Did you have something to tell them?
Kei-chan. She looks better with her bangs down
Damn, missed my chance.
Don't sniff it!
You're really energetic, aren't you?
Parent-teacher conference, huh?
Could it be that Kei-chan hasn't told his homeroom teacher that he's going to reject the recommendation so that he can go to the same high school as us?
Nothing will get accomplished by just by sitting here. Might as well go.
Idiot, I'm telling you it was a dream.
Riko-sempai, too.
I'll take you where you need to go, Riko-sempai!
Aw, Geez! What are those two doing?!
Hey, wait right there.
Enough... Please just let us through!
Keita.
Even I didn't know what to do. Why didn't you get here earlier?
Hey, hey! That's going too far.
I-It's okay like this.
Yeah, but that's what we get for causing trouble for him...
Really?
Are you planning on rejecting their feelings?!
N-No. Kei-chan, you too?R: I remember using an english word equivalent to "" instead of "No"....
It's like when they say; if you want to hide a tree, hide it in a forest.R: need another editor to check my use of a semicolon here.

Listen up Ako, eroge is the first step to being an adult.R: how about using "into adulthood." instead?
To buy an eroge...
Ako-nee... You're impure.dirty
No, no. There's another way of seeing it.
To buy an eroge... You were holding back your desire this whole time Riko-nee?R: "urges" can be used as well.
Kei-chan, over here, over here.
Look, look.
Here, I'll help you.
A female warrior.
Wait, Ako-nee!
Hey, quiet down!
Which one is good?
O.. kay...
Is it?
What are you taking an eroge for?
You misunderstand.
Speaking of which, earlier you were cosplaying.
What are you three thinking about?
So there's no problem.
Now is the time, for me to show my ability as a teacher.
Hurry, these go out fast.
Excuse me.
Sexual play?
Why not?
No, we didn't come here to--
As it is now, your sisters are going to turn out wrong.
If we were just a bit late to barge in, how would it have turned out?
Hello Keita-senpai.
Onee-chan?
Yes, she is.
You bought the game for me.
Is that how it is?
The eroge is fine then, but about Keita.
Guiding education.
My sister is an over enthusiastic educator.
So she might have done something abrupt.
Stop putting delusions and reality together.

So, to show you my gratitude, I'll give you a massage.
But it's summer, the final summer of our middle school years.
I want to teach you many things, many naughty things
I should have been the one seducing you... don't steal a march on me!
accept both of us!
I'll hold on to it.
But I'm a teacher, a model for students.
Sorry for making you wait.
Just as I thought. They're going on a date in public.
As an older sister and teacher, I can't let them do this!
Ta-da. How is it?
If the top's too big, you need to use pads. It's common sense.
If I'm just by the poolside, nobody will mind, right?
I'm just here to watch over my students, anyway.
Me too.
You two going flower picking?
I got so excited because I haven't been able to go out with Kei-chan in a while.
Take this, pervert!
Hey! I got it!
This is okay, right?
I'll return the jersey after washing it.
Mikazuki seems to trust her.
Yeah, this. I have to wash it and return it.
The butt area feels a bit tight, though.
What a nice smell...
This sour, pungent smell is good...
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
It's already like this.
You're misunderstanding us, Sensei!
blur4Say, why is it the more our hearts race, the more we get excited?
blur41
blur4but sure is fun
blur4
blur4He won't even say good morning
10 days until payday.
Thank you for coming during the break,
even though you're busy studying for your test.
What do you two think you're doing?
For a change of pace, you should be surrounded by your bikini-clad sisters.
What do you say, Keita?
My sisters in bikinis?
Which one are you going to wear?
They said they'd be there.
So, you don't need this, huh?
If I take one step forward, I can meet my admired Kanetsugu-sama in an air conditioned place.
They're...
Keita.
They're here, they're here.
But why is Mikazuki with them?
One adult ticket.
Here you go. 2500 yen.
Ako-nee... Riko-nee... They look amazing on you.
The pretty mannequin was wearing it and posed like this.
Wow! Amazing!
Just one...
Don't stare at them too much...
They're so expensive...
Me too.
What is it?
but this gives me a chance to find out what's going on.
Someone help.
Stop...
...a virgin?
This is okay, right?
Good thing you had club practice right before.
Roll, roll, roll... Taking off the wet stockings...
I'll return the jersey after washing it.
Keita-sempai, please come back to club practice again!
I'm getting really turned on...
This smell is amazing...
I'm doing this for you, you understand?
We're going to cross it.
Yo, what the hell are you doing just laying aro-
Next: August is always that.
That tickles!
Toda is with him too?
Really?
Yay, the pool, the pool.
Ako, hurry up.
Wait up.
Sorry for making you wait.
How about here? Do you like it here?
Fee table: Adults 2500 yen, children 1250 yen, students...
But I have a responsibility to lead them down the right path!
The pretty mannequin was wearing it and posed like this.
That top is fascinating!
I'm just here to watch over my students, anyway.
Me too.
but this gives me a chance to find out what's going on.
Hmm, somebody's in there already.
That was close.
One... Two...
Onee-chan.
After all, when you were our age, weren't you doing more things than we are?
You can't be.
Wh-What?
Roll, roll, roll... Taking off the wet stockings...
I guess guys worry about that kind of stuff, too.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
After all, I'm naked...
However, it doesn't really feel bad...
at the Otate no Ran in the Tenshou 6th year, along with his father,
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
But...
B-Because...
Is Miss Mikoshi in a festival outfit sexy?
and soon the noodles are ready!
If we can't find an answer in reality,
Endless happiness
Both of us are here
It's a secret, but what I really want is...
Since both of us love you now,
Let's do a lot of happy, lucky things.
I learned this from a book.
They're easier to understand than regular classes.
Those three have suddenly started getting along.
This is a test taker's day to relax.
For everyone's benefit!
Keita!
But a festival has to be like this.
Let's go. Off to relax, off to relax.
We're going.
You don't remember?
Alright.
A summer with an air of freedom is the most dangerous season.
I told you to wait!
It's during these times that one's true value stands out.
Right, Kanetsugu-sama?
The time finally came for me to lose both of them.
blur43
blur4We're actually rivals!
This is for Kei-chan.
It's cheap, it's cheap!
They're easier to understand than regular classes.
It's already that time?
Leave the bowl out, okay?
Then let's go.
Keita!
But a festival has to be like this.
Stop doing that in public!
No, it's this way!
Yeah, just relax. Relax.
You're eating something sticky again?
Is it the festival? Is it because of the festival?
Ahh! Again!
I have to be firm in order to keep the students from falling to temptation.
Those two are the Suminoe siblings.
I have to stop them.
What are you doing?
Yuzuki did... Yuzuki did her best.
Ah, Keita-sempai!
Mikazuki? What are you doing?
Well, I guess it's cute.
What kind of summer festival is this?
But why were we laughing?
They're skyrocket fireworks.
Welcome, welcome.
Here you are, your late night supper.
Indeed, it is nice.
Kei-chan is going with me to the festival.
What is this?
I'll go, I'll go! Just let go!
Why?
Kei-chan, take it out!
Please, hurry!
Tch...
What was that?
It's because you're a scaredy cat.
It's just for the two of us, okay?
You'll go... right?
As a teacher, as an adult, and yes, as a human!
I won't allow this between siblings.
No way...
Yuzuki did... Yuzuki did her best.
It's not open here, either.
This is for Kei-chan.
When it's painful, turn to deities
Before you even notice, they vanish.
Dad's gonna catch the king of all tuna one of these days.
Oh yeah, Keita. What are you going to do about a good luck charm?
How about one from Dazaifu?
So it's not even your actual reason?
Our futures will always be connected
It turned into true love before I knew it
Our love is better doubled than halved
Alright, I'm gonna do this.
I'm on the final stretch now.
Ah, Kei-chan.
It really does feel different with a headband.
Your late night meals are always the best!
Alright!
An apple of knowledge.
Ako-nee, it was good.
Say it clearly.
I can't say something like that.
Stop!
Did you notice?
Your sock is getting soaked by me.
Your foot is pretty big.
No, don't stare at me like that.
It's your fault. It's not like I can't stare.
Do you think that I'm a bad sister?
Sorry, was that too strong?
Then why don't you leave the kotatsu?
Keita, you probably
I'll take responsibility and take care
Ako-senpai. Riko-senpai.
Pubic hair.
You only have an amount that you can actually count.
It can't be, right?
Riko!
They're so loud.
It's okay, Kei-chan.
I can't help it.
I don't know.
Did it hurt that much?
Yeah, but I'm okay now.
Oh, it finally ended.
Welcome back.
Ako, you should just go to sleep now.
We've lost our chance to turn back.
Accept it.
What is this?
Keita.
If it's like this, I can show this to everyone.
Is this what they call youthful indiscretion?
blur4...!
blur4It looks silly
blur4and we have an operations meeting again today
Tre-at-ment.
I don't need it!
Dazaifu?
Keita, here.
I'm glad.
Alright, I'm going to do my best.
Thanks Riko-nee.
It tastes great!
Yeah, I feel like I really can pass the entrance exam now!
Ow, ow!
But I still remember the feeling of your hand when you touched it.
Even now...
Sorry, but I can't stop.
Riko-nee is kind of cute.
It's your fault. It's not like I can't stare.
No, I want you to look at me.
I can't joke about this.
No, not really.
Then why don't you leave the kotatsu?
What's been happening this whole time?
Where did they come from?
We might not win with just late night meals and a headband.
How's it going?
Oh, there's something that looks useful.
A charm that is said to be super effective on tests and other things like gambling as well.
Of course I do!
Ah, how refreshing.
Riko!
Why are you laughing?
But I'm glad we don't have to go through troubles alone.
With this small amount, will the charm still work?
Then I'll leave the charm bag to you.
She got me!
Come on, spread your legs.
No.
Kei-chan, it hurts.
Please, can you just make it one?
Sorry.
Ako-nee, to show my gratitude and to apologize, I'll lick you.
No, that's not it.
Oh, it finally ended.
There's something I have to reflect on.
I want you to think of it as us and treat is as such, but...
I'm off.
That can't be!
What is it?
It's nothing.
Oh, for this one, if you substitute 5 for X, you get 25  5a  30... inaudible
Yes, the answer is 3!
Don't worry!
I'm your private tutor.
Do you want to see it?
Damn! I can't lose focus like that!
So, are you awake now?
Sorry.
your breasts and stuff.
Kei-chan, you remembered my breasts and thighs perfectly right?
Being interested in.
Meaning, I'll be glad to.
At...
What an animal. need better words
Studying is the most important thing right now.
If it's for Keita's sake.
Did ya cheat?
You don't normally get good grades like that.
My, how admirable! She's studying by herself.
Are you sensitive there?
Study your teacher's body well.
So, when did you come?  a while ago ahahaha okay, no more comments
Question 1: What year did the Tokugawa shogunate fall?!
Remembered it.
What do you mean it makes your heart race?
She's your sister!
Please, hurry!
H-Hey, wait!
Kei-chan, you can't! Wow, he got pretty far with his sister...ew....
But if it's somewhere where it can't be seen, you can do it as much as you like.
Sorry?
if you want it...
It's all thanks to you, Ako-nee.
It was really good.
Dessert will be an apple.
Ow!
That was on purpose, wasn't it?
No, don't stare at me like that.
It's your fault. It's not like I can't stare.
Jeez, all you do is bother him!
A charm that is said to be super effective on tests and other things like gambling as well.
Of course I do!
But... but...!
She got me!
Kei-chan, it hurts.
I'm going Ako-nee.
And now the inside is complete.
What are you saying all of a sudden?
Hand made.
What?
What is this?
Kei-chan.
That can't be!
It's not.
What are we going to do about his exams?
is to be taken care of!
Kiss me
shouldn't we look for it in our dreams?
but they still found out
accept both of us!
Daytime
It hasn't gone down much, has it?
Kei-chan, you're the type of person that can do anything if you put your mind to it.
Huh?
You don't have enough love.
Keita, you're sweating.
I licked up Keita's sweat for him.
What?
Not you too, Ako-nee.
Leave everything to me.
We'll definitely make you get better.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
I didn't expect this surprise attack.
Keita-senpai.
I'm going to go over some rules and how things are timed.
He's been studying so hard to get into my school.
Really?
Kei-chan!
It fell in the doorway.
It's okay, just calm down.
Kei-chan.
Mine? Why?
Even when it comes to this.
That's not what a high school girl should be saying.
It's because you were there for me.
Oh, no! What have I done?!
Good night, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
That was our perfect chance!
I'm doing my best to hold it back!
Riko, you idiot!
blur4Could it be... Wait!
blur4
I just need some rest.
What are you saying?
Yes, I'm sorry.
It hasn't gone down much, has it?
You worked so hard.
Anyway, what are you doing to him?
Keita.
You're the one getting in my way.
You're going to keep this up even though I'm covered in sweat?
Kei-chan.
Stay in bed.
You're the best sisters I could have.
Okay, everyone, before the test starts,
I can't discriminate against him.
It's feeling breezy.
I'm out.
What are you doing?
But when things like this happen, Ako-nee, you really fall apart.
You're so careless.
Before we knew it, he's become so reliable.
Kei-chan.
I know this.
Whenever. Wherever.
Ako-nee?
Riko-nee?
They're pretty cute when they're sleeping.
You were trying to make me fall for it!
There were a lot of problems,
If he isn't better by tomorrow night...
is to be taken care of!
Finally, the real thing!
That's why I'm doing it.
That's why I was trying to take Kei-chan's cold.
Riko, you think that's just superstition, don't you?
Don't copy me.
If his ear is dirty, he might not be able to hear the English section of the exam.
Clear, clear...
Cut it out already.
Was it Ako and Riko-senpai's tender nursing?
Well, that's... um...
No matter what kind of problem child he might be,
You mean chilly, right?
Now's not the time for this.
Of course.
You're talking about that, right?
Ako...
Ako-nee, your ID card!
It fell in the doorway.
Kei-chan.
Ako, you're so helpless.
Riko-nee, here's yours.
You left it on your desk.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
This is the problem that Riko-nee helped solve.
It's okay.
I'm sure that I passed.
Riko-nee?
It's because you were there for me.
Hurry and get better.
Huh? They really are asleep.
His number is 1114.
I'm getting nervous.
Congratulations!
Me too, me too.
What?
Eh?
I hide it from my real friends
Kiss me
Since both of us love you now,
Let your curiosity run wild!
No, he's with me.
Mature, too.
Or not...
This is today's lucky item.
A line of black cats crossing my path and a typhoon of crows on the day of my graduation announcement.
All right! I passed, Keita!
Kenta!
So...
We weren't of any help.
Sorry.
Well, I did make a promise.
Well, if I take it next year, we can only be together for one year.
Eh?
As soon as I found it, it was already like this.
He was trying to bury it in my garden.
Well, I'm really sorry!
These are the students that made it into the open spots!
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
I did it. I really did it!
Got accepted.
He got accepted.
From spring onward, the three of us will be together.
Do you think this is good enough?
It looks kind of plain.
You can't come in.
The wind is coming from this direction, so the direction for luck is...
It is yours, but...
Yay, it came off! It came off!
Take that!
We made it!
Good luck, Kei-chan.
We did it!
Now we're in the same high school, Ako-senpai!
Don't tell me...
If you want to join, give me a call.
It's not true. It's not true.
It's not like you understand how we feel!
Keita-senpai!
Teaching... Sometimes it's chaotic. It's like a storm.
Sorry.
It's a little...
Yes.
A letter of acceptance will be mailed to those who passed the exam, and those who made it into the open spots.
Keita...
Congratulations, Keita.
Well done!
Why not?
He's so calm.
This is today's lucky item.
Riko-nee...
Enough to surprise you.
We made it!
Now we're in the same high school, Ako-senpai!
It's not true. It's not true.
We wanted to celebrate your acceptance with you.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee...
Kenta is my dog at home.
As soon as I found it, it was already like this.
He was trying to bury it in my garden.
Well, I'm really sorry!
I repeat--
All right!
Suminoe-kun...
But kissing and hugging is prohibited at high school, okay?
have one more graduation to attend.
Thank you, middle school life.
Kiss me
Tell me the difference between us
Man, it's finally over!
Um, that incident was...
It's mine!
It's mine!
Sorry, but it happened before I could react.
You even promised to give me your second button!
You promised Mikazuki-chan?!
He pisses me off.
Number four.
Everyone wrote something down, right?
No matter what I may get afterward, I can use it to get in a good spot with Kei-chan.
Why? We were originally just talking about his second button,
Keita-senpai, make sure you take a good look and engrave it into your mind.
It seems like my opinion doesn't matter, so let's get this over with.
What is this? What kind of people are they?
Jeez, she did it so shamelessly.
Embarrassing hair?
Go ahead.
Stop it.
Mikuni isn't like that.
Suminoe-kun, don't remain quiet.
Even though it's what I wrote, doesn't five minutes seem a little long?
How about we change it to one minute?
Look out!
I thought they would stay kids forever, but they're finally at that age.
What is there to hide?
Th-This is for our precious Kei-chan's graduation.
We'll do it together.
Kei-chan.
Keita.
I'm sorry, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Kei-chan.
Wearing nothing but a suit...
Kei-chan, hurry up!
We just thought: "You've become an adult as well."
This is embarrassing at our age.
Boo boo!
blur4
blur4Perhaps it's no coincidence that we fell for the same boy

Suminoe Keita.
Thank you, middle school life.
But, Keita.
What are you saying?
What are you saying? At least make a quip back.
Is that okay with you?
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid Keita senpai!
Damn you, Keita!
Ako-senpai. Riko-senpai.
Our second buttons.
Keita's Commemorative Graduation Objects Lottery!
who were unable to get his second button.
Eh, I'm not involved in this!
This is the one and only thing I need to avoid.
Next is for Keita-senpai to flip your skirt?
We've done it so much that he should be immune to it.
We can't underestimate this girl.
A formidable opponent.
The last one is...
Mikuni isn't like that.
This can't be.
It's okay. I'm fine with Keita-senpai being a fast one!
And even if I did, why would I tell you?
Was it because of that?
Eh?
Ours?
Keita left one for us.
Kei-chan.
This is a new year, so I'll wear this and do my best.
You'll be late for the opening ceremony!
Nothing, we just thought...
Thank you, middle school life.
From spring onward, I'll be a high school student.
once again we'll be going to the same school as our senpai this spring.
That's right! An awesome school life is about to start.
Hey.
What are you saying? At least make a quip back.
Next time I see her, I have to thank her.
Oh, Mikuni.
No, I should be the one to...
Number four.
Well, write your name down.
Oh, no!
Yay!
We've done it so much that he should be immune to it.
We can't underestimate this girl.
Embarrassing hair?
I don't have any. You saw that, right?
Well, let's get back to it.
I want to start from my name.
Mikuni isn't like that.
Jeez.
Even though it's what I wrote, doesn't five minutes seem a little long?
Nice, Riko!
To change the conditions as you like wouldn't be fair, would it?
This was...
Even so, that way of speaking is pretty rude, isn't it?
But looking at the Amidakuji, it seems like you've done things like this with your sisters.
Um, so what I'm trying to say is...
But you should try this at your new school, right?
Since we've graduated from middle school,
Yeah.
Seriously...
Was it because of that?
Th-This is for our precious Kei-chan's graduation.
Keita.
What are you doing?
Then we have to do it in order!
I wonder if Keita will like it.
A new suit.
Riko.
Okay.
Whenever Keita...
Kei-chan, hurry up!
Really?
For our spoiled Kei-chan.
Kei-chan.NKeita.
Did you need help with something?
What is he supposed to do, roll dice during his test?!
You're going to be my... tutor?
For this problem you...
I want to help Keita, too!
Isn't it nice that your siblings get along so well?
Because it's a special lesson.
"be glad to".
At...
No, you got it all wrong. I was just...
Warbler cries year 794, in ancient Kyoto.794 can be read as "nakuyo" which means "to cry"
It's just... Ako-nee has been tutoring me.
Ako-nee, I don't understand this part.
Then what kind of studying are you doing?
Wh-What is she doing?!
Sen... sei...
When I came to help you study, you were already asleep.
Okay! Here we go!
1573.
Huh? He actually...
I'll forgive you, though.
H-Hey, wait!
if you want it...
Oh well...
I'm home!
no matter how much time passes.
You're so lucky, Keita,
Hey, Keita.
I-Idiots.
You've only seen Riko's... so unfair...
Here! Kei-chan.
Just stir the dish in the pot and don't let it burn.
Ah Kei-chan.
Seriously, what are they doing...?
It's because I trusted a certain someone too much!
Drink this first.
Where's mum and dad?
Did you need something from them?
It's already become like this.
Don't smell it!
but you still exercise in the mornings.Perhaps shorten this to "But you still excersie in the morning" or shorter-N
but hasn't told his head teacher yet.
It doesn't matter.
Riko-senpai! Ako-senpai!
They're siblings...
Please listen to this song I wrote.
This is...?
Keita?
Keita is going to marry Ako after all, right?
I don't!
After substituting 5 for x, it's 25  5A  30.
Don't worry!
Ako's grades have always been excellent.Corrected since they're not past tense, but likely still are excellent
Oh yeah, Kei-chan, what do you want for a midnight snack?
That was good! Riko. That was good, Riko! -this is my suggestion -milky
No... I still remembered but...
W-What is this?
And it means?english to japanese i assume
The inside of my right leg says...
A wild beast!
The test was fine,
but a lot of other terrible things happened.
What's going on, Keita?
The amazing student council president?a person to pity to?Should we capitalize Student Council President?-milky
Such heavenly bliss!
Nothing special.
I knew you did perverted things with your sister!"I knew you did perverted things with your sister!" is much better -milky
I didn't!
Next is cucumbers.
I rub...
Yeah.
Work hard... Using my body.Changed "study" for "work" in benefit of ero. -nt
and happily slept next to me?Seriously, wtf is up with a comma followed by a capital letter?
Forget about that. Study, study!enough of this?And random caps in middle of lines
You have to work harder!
Um...
No... It's already...
What year was the Kamakura Shogunate defeated?
I actually remembered?
I can't do it...
As it's a punishment game, it can't be helped.
Riko!
You made it?
I made it! My grade went up, look!grade or grades?
Girls are like desserts.
Next time...
Alluring sweets. I'll give you a kiss.
Mine was really sweet, wasn't it?
You're the one who interrupted me!
Because you were a step ahead of me.
That's not it!
No more kissing!
Thank you, Ako-nee.
Work hard!
If you say that, then I won't give it to you anymore.
Keita, you've been getting midnight snacks from Ako-nee, right?
Sometimes, I want something different.
For example, sweets...
She's been my rival from the start... my rival...
After getting home, you're under the same roof as Ako and Riko-senpai.
This and that are all waiting for you.
Little things like this in school don't impress you at all, right?
Oh, this is a chocolate banana.
I don't understand.
Senpai, please have a taste!
But...
Dad, are you there?
Not here?
Not enough knowledge of English
But before I knew...I don't know when that started...
What happened?
Keita, this is for you.
This isn't kissing.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Do you want more? I can add a lot more.
Okay, one sweets.
Wait, Riko-nee.
Keita, you're breathing hard.
What is this? Oil?
I can't even tell if I'm being licked or sucked on anymore.
W-Wait, let me rest. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111111
Wait Keita, I've almost melted away.
No, it's already this wet.
I never knew that you actually... liked sweets this much.
That's true, you know.
You're horrible! What are you doing?!
What do you think my crotch is?
D-Do you want me... to help?
Did you forget that we have two blossoming daughters?
I'll kill you if you say that again.
Yes...
A boy?
Ako do you have a brother complex?
How could that be? It's such a waste thinking of your brother as a love target.
If you want, you can pick any guy you want as your lover.
Keep moving! Keep going!
My hopes are destroyed. Guys are way too dirty.
Bullies.
Ah...Does this really need TL? can we please rip these out? I mean if its in the beginning of the sentence, i can understand, but this as its own line???
Ah, it's Keita's turn.
Yeah... really.
Yeah...
Nothing... doing what? Ummm...
Wishing for Kei-chan to pass!I hatethat, it's bad :P
Eh?
Oh, yeah...tlc, "I guess so"?Guess so is lit, but whatever works
Eh? What's that? Where's your offering?
Ah... that child is so bold.
Both!
That's not true!
let's hold a marriage ceremony.
I'm next!
Because... because...
You're saying that so casually.
I won't give my sisters to some random guy.
Boys are such weird creatures...
What are you two saying?
I can't do it anymore!
Go ahead and eat.
This is the only relaxation bored candidates get.
Is it interesting? TLCIs this really what he says?
R-Ridiculous! There are types of girls I like too!
Ones with a feeling like this.
Maybe he's cheating on us.
No way...
On a vaulting horse...
What happened between the three of you?
Woah! I've recovered my health!
Lust dispel!
I'm taking exams!
I can't... I couldn't stop it.
Are you okay?
Damn it.
But...
It would be bad if you caught a cold.
Yeah.
Already a third year and I actually wet myself in front of my classmate.
No, no, no!
Eh?!
Um...
Who are you?
He won a PC in a bingo competition at work!
Isn't it great? We've never had a PC in our house before.
Keita, you're still such a kid.
Even so, there are lots of dreams left in Akiba!
Hide a tree in a forest, right?
What do we do?
Whatever. You think of some words, too.
You're being awfully specific.
That's it... I'm at my limit.
Ero? What are you saying? Those are just drawings!
That would be the best!
What the hell is this about? And where did Riko-nee go anyway?
Are you hiding something? The two of you are being a little strange today.
Since we've come all the way to Akiba, it'd be a shame if we didn't try it out.split -masat
How do I put this on?
Ako-nee, w-wait!
Pipe down already! Manners have been declining in Akiba lately.
W-Wasn't that Kiryuu-sensei just now?
"I'm buying that!" What's that supposed to mean?
Erm, well...
Wait!
This is as far as I can go...
What are you doing on the adult floor?
Who's this?
She's our teacher in high school.
...younger brother, Keita. Thanks for taking care of my older sister.
And the game Riko-san wanted...
I don't want to be told that by a teacher buying eroge!
He's our step-brother.timer please split this - Nanakotodone -masat
Excuse me.
Kanetsugu-sama, please... flirt with me!
Then I shall do as you say!
Kanetsugu-sama!
I can't find them anywhere!
Has Onee-chan been bothering you?
Onee-chan?
So that's how it is.
My sister is really enthusiastic about education, so she may have gone too far.
You two get along well.
Note: fujoshi - Literally "Rotten girl"
Sorry...
This isn't good.
Keep up the good work, Keita-senpai.
Like this...
Getting frisky with your junior to relax after studying, eh?
That's great.
But it's summer! It's our last one as middle schoolers!
You want me to bring your swimming trunks, right?
You just want to see Ako-nee and Riko-nee in their swimsuits.
Not only will I be able to see my beloved Kanetsugu-sama...
If all goes well, I can overcome my financial difficulties.
As I thought, they're meeting up in broad daylight.
Keita.
Keita-senpai, me too!
Kei-chan...
Wait! They can see them!
What's with these prices? check time please, it finshed too early, reason: i took away a pointless line - Nanakoto
The entrance fee is already painful enough... check time please, it started too early, reason: i took away a pointless line -Nanakoto
I'm sure they won't mind how I look.
Let's go, Riko.
I didn't think I'd run into them this fast,
And another one!
W-What do you mean...
When you were at our age, weren't you more promiscuous?
You don't mean...
Hey!
It looks like Mikazuki trusts her, and she's worried about us as well.
Oh, I almost forgot.
As I thought, there's a lot of it around the armpits.
Wearing nothing but a jersey feels really good.Wearing a jersey while being naked feels really good.
Take them off?
Do you want to touch them?
How are they?
Yo, what you doing! Get yo' ass out of bed!
Am I bewitching?
Those three have become pretty lively lately.
What are you talking about? He is going with me!
Ouch, it hurts! Stop it! Let's just all go together!
No!
We can't!
Don't be so reckless. I can't become two people!
Oh I see.
No, this way!
Keita!
Something sticky again, huh?
Why am I so excited?
You were so cute back then, Kei-chan.
Chick-san, chick-san... Chick-san, chick-san.
What are you talking about?
Nee-chan!
What are you talking about, Riko-nee?
As if I'm scared now! I'm not a kid anymore.
As you are siblings, it shouldn't be allowed!
Let's go!
W-Wait!
What is that?
I'm sorry, God.
I caught you!
I'll give you a kiss!
Are your studies moving along?
The headband does make a difference. It really is a must for exam applicants.
You're eating like you haven't had any dinner.
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Th-There.
Is it disgraceful for a sister to get off on her little brother's foot?
Sorry, was that too strong?
I might be ruined for marriage.
Well...
Yeah, it's hot, I'll just...
Keita, are you...
You're not going to eat your apples?
Keita, you're not only getting big, but also hot and ready to burst...
I'll take responsibility and care for him?
Stop fooling around. At least try to help Kei-chan pass the...
Ako, is yours growing?
But, but!
Sorry, sorry. I just thought that it's funny that we twins are similar to that level.
But isn't it great that you won't have to worry alone?
Well then, I'm going to the bathroom.
That statement seems dubious.
Did you pull one out?
It's fine!
This is a charm, right?
Keita!
Thank you, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
...this open!
The breeze was there all along.motomoto suusuu shiteta kuse ni -Pipelynx This is me trying to make this tsukkomi work, TLC please -Pipelynx
Screw this, we shouldn't have done this!
No, it's not!
I'll do anything to make him healthy again!
Definitely.
The next one will go deeper.
I mean, what the hell are you doing to an ill person?
You're the one who got in my way!
Don't copy me.
When the exams are over, I'll let you play inside me. play is probably best, idk if i'd understand "i'll let you refresh yourself inside of me." also, could add "to your heart's content"
I'll be going.
Yeah.
Hey, are you OK!?
Banner: Victory! Keita-senpai!
What's up with that reaction?
Whatever difficulties may arise,
Ah! It's not here! It's not here!
What should I do?
Ako-nee! Your exam voucher!
What the hell were you doing? You dropped it at the front door!
I just delivered it to you.
Before long, he got really responsible, Bee: I've probably done this a couple of times already, but I need to check with Holo about leaving a comma after a certain line where there is a continuing clause AFTER the said line
even more than us older ones. Bee: moreso, about leaving the first letter of said clause in lower case since it's not a sentence
Ah well...
I know it. I know it!
This is a problem Ako-nee taught me how to solve.
This is a problem I solved with Riko-nee.
It'll be OK. I stayed calm until the end.
I'm sure it'll be OK.
I'm home!
R-Riko.
His exam number is 1114. A nice day.
No, mine is sweeter.
Mine.
That applies to the both of you!
Please stop disturbing my studies!
It's fine if you understand...
This is a topping. A topping.
Well, I am selfish.
Keita, I heard that Ako has been preparing late-night meals every night.
That works... in this case, right?
Really?
It's actually very tiring.
Don't be so greedy!
This is my best, huh?
Was there something wrong with my lecture?
Please, don't hesitate to let me know.fscx200-
How would I...
Focus, focus.
Focus.
I can't.
This isn't a kiss.
Right, encouragement.
It's cho-co-late.
Eh? What?
Anyway, I'd like to eat my second helping of chocolate. Is it okay?
Go eat a late-night meal.
You kind of want to remember it,
Next time: A Lover's Qualifications.
We knew it, we knew it.
There!
The wind is this way...
My happy, lucky, wonderful, high school life with Kei-chan depends on today's announcement!
Look.
...possible...
Eh? B-But what happened? What is it- - NeWbY
Amazing! Amazing! You're amazing! You're amazing! - NeWbY
Don't tell me...
Huh? Where's Keita?
Education...
But, accepting it head-on is also a kind of love.
We're sorry.
We didn't realize that...
We weren't any help at all...
And still... I'm sorry for such bad results!
Congratulations for next year!
Cheers for next year!
Umm... Kenta found...
He suddenly ran away when we were walking.
What are you doing, Kei-chan?
I got accepted!
Keita got...
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
Thank you,
The three of us will have another very, very important graduation ceremony.
Next time...
Suminoe Keita.
W-What are you saying, all of a sudden?
It's mine!
If you're fine with me, please take my button.
What should we do?
Ako-senpai, Riko-senpai!
Kei-chan's graduation memorial Amidakuji contest!
Participants, write down what you want in order, OK?
T-Then...
My opinion has not been taken into consideration.
Opinion rejected, right?
Starting.
One, two.
It's the prize I wrote myself.
I'm starting.
My aim is the one I wrote myself.
In front of everyone?
Riko-senpai gets embarrassed in front of people...
The right to stay in the gym store room for five minutes and do XX with Keita.
Lucky last, I see...
And what's with this XX?!
...to...
This atmosphere is bad.
I see, Suminoe-kun doesn't know that I'm also going to Tamahide High School yet.
I can't say it. I can't tell him that we're going to the same high school now.
It took a while, but I finally said it.
Well then, see you, Mikuni.
It's OK! I don't mind if Keita-senpai is a fast one.
We always thought of you as a kid,
But I will definitely not lose.
Thank you for the time we spent together. This makes the most sense -PipelynxSoon, I'm going to be a high school student.
Riko and I...
Kei-chan...
Keita...
Didn't we agree on no rivalry? -Pipelynxdon't know how to TL this - Nanakoto
S-Stop it! These are for my sisters!
...chooses.
Liar, liar.
Or have a bath?
You saw Riko's, didn't you?
Since you've seen Riko's, you should look at mine too..
We're exactly the same size!
They're just like when we were kids.
Give them to me!
Say "Ah".
What neighbourhood association trip?
So heavy.
Kei-chan.
And we're siblings!
Oh, good morning Kei-chan.
Are you relaxing because you got a recommendation?
Maybe Kei-chan didn't tell his homeroom teacher about turning down the recommendation to try to get into our high school yet...
Today is Keita's important parent-teacher conference.
Did you just say Riko-senpai?
They're siblings...
Riko-senpai, please give one to me too!
It's nothing but a bother when you two show up!
We're... a bother.
Hey, isn't that a bit much?
T-This is fine...
Ako-nee and Riko-nee came here for this?
Both your mom and me already had kids when we got remarried.
...a spoiled little boy.
Eh?! I-It's nothing!
Kei-chan?
Starting today, I'm going to do my best to help you study!
I'm going to be your tutor.
Yes!
I'm not going to rely on luck, I'm definitely gonna make you pass.
Damn it, I can't lose my focus!
Nothing special really.
It's not like that.
Kei-chan, are you listening?
Not that!
I'm sorry.
It's not like that!
That's because this is a special lesson.
And that means...
He's a groper, a groper!
What's going on, Keita?
She must have taught you other things as well!
Kei-chan!
What a dream.
Well, then what kind of studying did you do?
I'm impressed, studying by herself.
Rub... it?
But, we're...
W-What was with that dream?!
She's finally helping me study for those tests...
Ok, today we're going to have a test.
You've got a mock exam this weekend, remember?
And the Kamakura Bakufu?
Tick... Tock...
"Getting excited" my ass.
You mean...
Oh my.
Congratulations, Kei-chan.
A kiss to you.
How was it? Was it sweet?
Mine is!
You should try to have a bit more self-control!
That's not what I meant!
It doesn't matter, you still can't.
But, you know...
Like what?
That's right, they say the handmade ones taste the best.
Umm... It's got something to do with salt...
Ready to do "this" and "that" with you...
Gentlemen, let's do this!
And then like this...
What is this all of a sudden? I don't understand any more...
Anyway, I'll get out of here before I get dragged into this.
Oh! Sweets!
I see.
This is impressive, Riko-nee, you really outdid yours-
Oh, sweets!
Oh no, I might be getting too excited.
Wait, Keita
You idiot!
So sweet and...
While I was working so hard to get dinner ready...
Are you ok?
You liar!
No dinner for you for the time being!
Huh?! No way!
Oh, sweets!
What do you think my body is?
The school library!
Oh, Keita, come take a look at this, it's your sisters in their school uniforms.
Aren't they cute?
Hey Keita, you don't really mean that, do you?
You're just like an old woman.
A boy, right...
He's a boy.
This can't be, something so abnormal.
Are you bragging?
Why would I? I've got Kei-chan.
Me too.
You can ask for something better, too.
You should stop by at least once in a while.
Aren't people studying for entrance exams like that normally?
I got to see him.
We've been coming here every day since you started studying for the exams.
Almost, at least.
We're already done.
It's not like I believe in gods.
Are you sure about this?
I even put in my New Year's money.
I think it'd be best if you started considering a lot of things.
This one, as well.
Doing this won't do anything!
Are you giving up?
Look at that one.
What's wrong?
What are you saying?
No, don't, Suminoe-kun is...!
I'm for curves...
Uh... I'm for big breasts!
I-I'm sorry.
Like in the nurse's office.
Or on the stairs.
Not in a billion years even!
POWER!
Did you hear about the new trick that Ero-Demon is using?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Mikuni Miharu!
Wait here.
Damn this...
"That"?
But...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, it just happened.
I'll take it to my grave.
A kiss to you.
Eat up!
I-It's nothing.
What kind of "guy talk" is this?
Really now...
Nothing really.
I smell a lucky pervert.
As if he cheated, maybe.
But?
Maybe I have a cold?
Woah, I'm all powered up!
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.
Ok, time for some studying in the library.
Yeah!
Did you hear about the new trick that Ero-Demon is using?
fs36I've heard about it, some Keimi from F Middle School saw him feeling up a middle school girl in a busy district in the town next to ours.
Like any sister would.
They finally left.
Stop shaking me!
Huh?
Mommy!
What should we do?
We have no other choice, we'll have to do "that".
This isn't the time to be embarrassed.
as a third year... And in front of a classmate no less.
There's a window here!
Uneasiness at Akiba.
But in Akiba, there are still lots of unfulfilled dreams awaiting our arrival.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
That's just...
All these stores look the same, you could get lost easily.
Only the real Akiba residents are able to tell the small differences.
"Blowjob."
"Treasure boat."
I'm sorry.
That would be awesome.
Well, she just had something to do.
But I don't want them to do that.
To commemorate, an Akiba commemoration shot.
Come on, just take 'em off already.
You can't do something dirty in here.
More importantly, wouldn't I lose all my standing as a teacher if she saw me wearing this outfit?
No, I got it first.
Kiryuu...sensei?
First off, I'll start acting like we're a normal student and her teacher.
Suminoe-san, what is a high school student doing in the adult section?
Yeah! I was just looking into the contents of these games I keep hearing about, it's just research. TLC
Thank you very much.
You came just in in time.
Thank you for taking care of my sisters.
You dropped it.
Was this the reason you came here?
Such abnormality can only lead to unhappiness.
And he just happens to be our younger brother.
Now is the time to show my skill as a teacher!
The problem might be from your side, after all.
No, we weren't planning on doing that.
Like I said! You're siblings.
Hello, Keita-senpai.
Yes, of course.
She's a sister I can rely on.
I wonder what it would feel like if Kei-chan told us that.
You're uploading this on your blog?
I'll make sure to hide your face.
That's not the problem.
Another 100 to go.
My sisters in swimsuits...?
What's up?
Toda is with them?
You're happy now, right?
If I didn't tell them I was going to the pool, they would've gotten mad at me.
T-This is...
Does it look good?
A swimsuit should be practical in the first place.
Ta-da! What do you think about this?
You have to fill up the space with a pad. That's common sense.
What now?!
And this!
And another one!
What's going on here?
W-What do you mean...
A virgin?
I'll wash the jersey and give it back to you.
Indeed, being naked and all.
I-I'm sorry.
You've got it all wrong, Sensei!
What are girls made out of?
This one was sweeter right?
No, mine is sweeter.
Good morning Keita.
That's because you tried to get ahead of me.
That applies to the both of you!
No, I will.
But what?
Here you go, sempai. Enjoy.
I guess.
Huh? It's a chocolate-covered banana.
That works too, sempai!
I guess there's no other way.
I don't have enough.
Focus, focus.
At first, I didn't want it...
...Lipstick?
Because sometimes you want sweet things right?
Maybe I'll have one more...
Okay. One order of sweets coming right up.
Sweets...
I'll put it on.
This is Riko's doing. LOL!!! Kiip out Trying to make a fool out of me.
Can you just stick out your tongue?
Well, as for me, I didn't know your body was as sweet as chocolate.
Sugar, spice and everything nice.
It's not like that. It's chocolate.
That summer day when I first felt a man. A Lover's Qualifications
Does it feel good?
I read about it in a magazine.
Th-This is....
This is what the ideal relationship between an exam student and his sisters should look like.
We could do that.
Let's go, it's your break after all.says breather again
It's fine,
Yep. Time for some relaxation.
Why am I getting all excited right now?
So you don't want any this time.
Don't you remember?
The time we went to a festival when we were little?
That was so cute, wasn't it Kei-chan?
Hello little chicky, hello.
What are you saying, Riko-nee?
What do you mean, still?
It was when we came here when we were little.
Right?
You'll come with me, right?
let's go!
Congratulations!
Kanetsugu-sama!
Doesn't it make want to you stop and stare?
Aren't I just like a midsummer fairy?
You're all covered in dirt and there's even a cobweb stuck in your hair.
But why were we laughing then?
Wait up!
But I can't go on any longer.
She was peefscx200-
Ah, Kei-chan's back.
Hey, I'm not just going to get beaten like this!
The one who started it is the kid!
Stop judging me by my looks!
Say it properly.
Absorb?!
I can't take my eyes off you.
That's kinda...
Of course I'll eat some! I'll eat them!
What are you doing here?
you might start doing unnecessary searches.
And to finish it off, she said something like that...
One, two, three...
You already know I don't have much either, Ako.
Ako.
Since when were we making one together?
I-I don't want to.
I don't have a lot of them.
I'm going to end up looking like a baby.
Jeez... You idiot!
I see.timing plox
Well then...
It's too embarrassing, so stop talking about it like that!
I'm so sorry, old people.
Are Ako and I getting entangled inside of this?
But, where is this from?
Is that so?
TL Note: Stop means stop.No shit sherlock Moshi
I've got it with me, look!
It's probably just my imagination, but it suddenly feels breezy down there.
He needs to get better before tomorrow night!
Talk about bad timing...
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's why coming to school would be a bit...
No matter how much we'd bother you,
D-Dummy! What do you think you're doing?
No, stop moving around.
Stop fighting, both of you.orig: Stop fighting, you two. other orig: Stop fighting, guys.
Keita, you're sweating.
Don't copy me!
I-Idiots!
You did, didn't you?
I-I didn't.
Just lay back and relax.
We can't do that.
If you watch out for careless mistakes, you'll definitely pass.
Okay.
What's up with that reaction?
Well, that's kinda...
I can't just discriminate against him.
Hey, are you listening to me?
Ako-nee, your exam ID!
I really know this.
No, I'm not saying that...
I'm back!
Well, it's better than fighting all the time...TLC'd
If I don't make it, then there's nothing I can do about it.
Thanks for everything up until today.
You're trying to make a fool of me again!
Stop it already!
Kei-chan will get accepted no matter what.
Yeah, yeah!
Take that!
I don't know.
Ako, how's the cooking coming along?
Ri-Ri-Riko-nee!
TL Note: A pun on the word Ochiru to fallfail.
We did it!
It comes with free drinks as well as many other things...
Oh, man! That's bad. How could I forget to put them up?
Why?!
Something is definitely wrong.
Shut up!
As colleagues, we'll do our best to look for a high school next year!though colleagues sounds a bit off
Get her to stop this foolishness at once.
Huh? Where's Keita?
Education... Teaching...
Let's go!
Just the two of us.
We were unable to read the atmosphere. And because of that, we caused you such problems.
Kei-chan?
You know, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Keita.
Ah! Kenta!
Suminoe-kun?
This board is for those who have been put on the waiting list for acceptance.
I passed! I got in Tamahide High!
Kei-chan...
Thank you, Riko-nee-chan.
Thank you, my middle school life.
Man, we're finally done!
Before?
No, no. It should be me who, well, you know...
All of his buttons are gone!
What?! They're all gone?!
No, not really.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BLASTING OFF AGAIN
Denied.
Well, let's start with that one then.
Out of all of the prizes, this collar is the only miss.dud, maybe?
Yeah, I wrote this one.
There's no way that that's going to turn him on.
We've been doing it to him so much, he should be used to it by now.
But I can't turn him on with just my panties underpants nowadays.
She's a formidable opponent...
Ah, in front of everyone?
I'm sorry, I pass.
You were planning this from the start, weren't you?
So, what do you wanna do?
O-Of course not!
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Keita's "other" graduation ceremony.
Didn't we promise that we'd get him off together?!
Goodbye
How should I act when I bump into him there?
Pick me.
We were just thinking how grown up you've become.
What are you doing? That's so embarrassing at this age.
If a dog chases you again we will protect you.
But since you're a guy you should learn to deal with it yourself.
Forever.
Were you dozing of because of lack of sleep?
I hope for you that you guys don't do anything envious!
Welcome home, Keita!
It just went through me when I heard "meal" and "bath".
You've seen them, didn't you?
No, I didn't see anything...
Yes?
You shouldn't compete so lively with her over something like this...
Sorry for the intrusion...
It's not good to drink coke during the meal!
Eat your stew!
They said they would return tomorrow evening.
Huh? Didn't we tell you?
You are strange.
Jeez, what irresponsible parents I have...
OK...
Is this because it's already certain which school you will attend through your recommendation?
If it's like that you should rather become the manager of the track and field club.
No that's fine.
For me it's not the other members I consider as a club but only you!
Kei-chan, hurry up!
No objections.
Ako-senpai!
No way...
They're siblings...
Wasn't it the same last time?!
If you're thinking about me then never show up here again!
That may be fine with you, but not for me!
We thought you have something important to do, that's why we came.
It seems we did something unnecessary.
Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
What's with this guy, just when we thought he got angry, and now this...
Kei-chan you're really, no matter how much time passes...
No, not really...
Not good... I'm feeling breasts...
How much do you think makes this?
I don't want that! There are plenty of things that I want to do with you there!
Let's do our best! We still can make it!
Yes, the correct answer is 3!
Jeez, what are you doing? Don't lose your concentration!
It just went through me...
Ako-nee...
I will... Do my best, too!
Any progress on your studying?
Chicken and egg on rice! What a bold move of you!
But I can still take care of the lower part of his body!
It's only 2 o'clock.
Yeah!
Of course!
"At"...
look at...
Kyoumi ga aru...
...in...
By our admired Ako-senpai?!
Let me see...
I will teach you everything!
Rub, rub...
Well then, I have to...
But we are...
Is that bad? Rather than that, off to your studies!
Well, we already did a small test in school.
How about getting a kiss from me?
I'll give you ten questions!
But I will forgive you.
Please... Hurry...
Wait.
Mine is sweeter!
Wait!
NO!
Any further kisses are prohibited!
Do your best, Keita!
Indeed, her food is yummy... And perfect...
Sweets!
No, no, no, no!
Ehm... I should put in some sugar...
That should be right in this case, isn't it?
I've got lots of problems!
And like this...
So this is my limit...
But my conscience wouldn't allow me to do things half-heartedly...
And also...
I give up.
OK! I'll ask him!
Seems he's not here.
Give it to me for a moment.
I can't!
Just like Ako's night meal...
So it's not a kiss...
Cho-co-la-te...
Sweets?
I'll do it for you...
I've never put on lipstick before.
She even misspelled it...
No... I'm so wet...
They are made of sugar and spice and many other wonderful things!
TAKE YOUR SUPPER!!!
Well then...
Then chew on this!
The grounds at evening...
I'll give you a kiss...
Gosh! What are you doing?!
Don't you get the feeling that it's only the two of us lately?
Oh, Keita, have a look., it's your sisters in their school uniforms!
But they feel a bit lonely though...
Are you forgetting that you have daughters that are in puberty as well?
I think being ignored almost every time at home is worse.
Ah! I want those wonderful days to return!
Y-Yeah...
A boy?
No way! The one she is in love with is her-
What should I do?
That's a threesome!!!
I got it. Let's try it!
Ill-tempered!
Kei-chan!
Don't run away!
Stop!
No! I won't let you go home for today!
Ako-nee, Riko-nee...
I...I'm sorry!
Well, OK I guess.
He? That's just for consolation, isn't it?
He's so unlovely...
Those were great times.
But we can still kiss him today.
By winning, it is as if your prayer for success was blessed.
Here... And here too!
This one as well!
Pops, why didn't you tell me
Doing this is absolutely pointless!
It probably started that time...
What is it?
At a place I don't know of...
Boys are animals...
Forever...
Suminoe-kuns touching my...
You are one of the winners having an erotic life!
D-Don't say talk nonsense! I do have a normal taste for girls!
I like huge breasts!
Huh?
No way! Kei-chan would never-
In the corridor...
Don't hesitate and bring up some courage!
Supreme perfect enlightenment!
Kei-chan!
Wicked mind, disperse! Lust, disperse!
Hurry up!
Yes!
And as his sisters we have to make sure he stays well, right?
This is...
Thank goodness, now I can finally...
NO!!!
Hey! Wait!
Why does he know my name?!
Don't just stop so sudden-Ah!
Mikuni: I've endured it the whole time in the library...
This is my limit...
No...!
Are you alright? Can you still endure it?
i1Thati0?
O-Ouch...
Hey, are you alright with the underwear you have on?
That's not meant in a weird way, but wouldn't it be bad to catch a cold?
Yes...
Oh my goodness! You both look so fabulous!
Hey, Keita, take a look!
Don't worry, they might be a little too big now, but when you get taller, they'll be a perfect fit.
Keita
It's so boring.
As a teacher, it is my duty to save students from going down the wrong path.
But Riko, you're so popular!
No way.
Mean...
Rude, perverted...
I was reminiscing on the past.
Me too.
I must be tired from studying so much.
I'm going home.
Ako-nee. Riko-nee. Thank you.
Don't tell him!
Nor did you clap!
That's not true.
fs40Let me be Oomiya-kun's girlfriend! ...please! - Miki
Let's not bring that up anymore!
Through the "reaching out" part, your wish of being accepted comes true.
Look, this one's also...
This shouldn't even be popular anymore.
If Ako and Riko saw this, they wouldfscx200-
Thank you for being so earnest.
W-Well...
omg, gimme that money
Kei-chan, I love you.
Here's a kiss to you.
Dad did it this time!.
N-Nyan!
Why you ask...?
Naked pictures
They shouldn't be typical words that are typed in commonly.
Don't worry about that, just come up with something!
Ero is not about 2-D or 3-D!
This brings back memories!
Yes, Keita mustn't come in contact with Ero-Games.
I didn't realize it...
I'll buy an Ero-Game.
What's with you?
That's Akiba's trademark!
Kei-chan, have you finished changing your clothes?
Or, should I just say that this might be more stimulating for you than walking around nude...?
Excuse us-
This can't be! Does she have the same hobby as me?!
T-That's a misunderstanding! This is just...
Where has she run off to?
Kiryuu-sensei?
Love between brother and sister won't have a future!
An ethical, moral and educational problem!
Here is finally the urgent dealing for the prohibited goods!
You easily jump to such imaginations...
Receive the shots of my match block gun!
Don't be bothered by trivial matters!
Ueh he he! You can't escape!
Ahh! No!
Like I said, love between siblings-!
Let's get it started! Oh hi hi!
Yes, that's right!
And when I became so sad about that,
And do it bolder!
I'm sorry...
If you feel sorry then take your pose already!
Next time: Wh, what!? The tune of a sopping wet midsummer.
This is a problem...
What should I do?
Toda!
Don't you think, Keita?
My sisters in swimsuits...?
Yay! The pool! The pool!
I'll hold onto this for a while...
I doubt you hit it, but if you do I'll know.
You're late!
This can't be!
Well, we're finally at the pool, so let's swim together.
It's for the sake of educational guidance.
Are you two going to pick some flowers?
Jeez, don't say such things!
Let's go, Riko.
I didn't expect to run into them this fast.
But this is a rare opportunity to get some information.
Oh, seems the toilet is already occupied.
Are you alright?
Take another one!
More importantly, you have to change clothes or you'll catch a cold, Onee-chan!
Kei-chan, don't look!
And she's suspected to be a nerd.
T-This is...
It's the smell of sweat... Has it become stronger?
So this is how a boy's sweat smells...
It has a spicy aroma...
My whole body is enveloped by Keita-kun!
together with his father Kanetoyo, followed Kagekatsu, but...
Where have you been staring at this whole time?
Your sisters are kinda disappointing on that aspect, don't you think?
Oh, this is not good.
You were the one who tempted me into doing this!
B-But!
Since when?!
I couldn't make love with both of my sisters...
Good morning Masamune-sama...
I'll give you a kiss!
This is important! Got it? The model sentence for this word is-
Thank you for introducing me such a good place.
Isn't it nice?
Wait! Please wait!
How annoying...
Go!
Don't worry, we'll find her sooner or later.
Mr. Chicks... Mr. Chicks... Hihihi... Mr. Chicks...
Kei-chan, take it out!
Jeez, you always butt in when it's coming to the good part!
Suminoe-kun and his sisters are at it again...
This time he's going with me!
What are you saying?
Again?!
This is quite the far away place here, why are you bringing me here?
You kept clinging onto us the whole time
You were such a scaredy-cat.
To a darker, more silent...
I have to stop them!
TL Note: Yamanaka Shikanosuke was a Japanese samurai of the Sengoku period born under the crescent moon and is known as the samurai of the crescent moon.
TL Note: Lol we even asked a Japanese and this weird TL doesn't sound too off... To be exactly he had no idea as well...
Well, I guess it's cute...
What is this...?
Then why did we laugh just now?
Keita!
Impossible...
I'll give you a kiss.
No matter if it's joy or pain... this winter depends on my endurance!
I'm telling you, I'll definitely catch one of those tuna!
A good luck charm for school success.
TL Note: Dazaifu is a city located in Fukuoka Prefecture.
You know, I... I...
This is the last spurt, so I've got to study seriously now!
Well then, I'm going to make you some tea.
Oh, thank you!
It's quite different with a headband after all!
Ako, you...!
Let's dig in!
Definitely! I already feel like I could effortlessly move mountains!
What?
Ouch!
What are you doing, Riko-nee?
But you seem to like it more this way.
Don't say stick!
Riko-nee, what are you using my foot for?!
It feels good, Keita... It's wonderful...
Ah, are you feeling it?
Getting into-?!
To put it precisely, I can't leave...
Of course, at once!
Because of my sweat, Riko-nee's toe is giving me such a sensation...
Have you come here to pray for passing the exams as well?
After this, I have to pray three more times today!
...pff!
"-that you can even count them"...
...can't be.
What is it?!
Like I said... what are we-
If it's bothering you that much, then let me take a look at it...
If we combine ours, then it should be strong enough.
Oh right! Why don't we have Keita pull them out for us?
Kei-chan, this is embarrassing...
I.. I don't want you to..
...or else I'll end up like a baby as I don't have that many...
I'm so sorry...
I'm not like you...
I'm perverted by nature...
If were making one, then we should hurry...
Keita...
we let our chance to back down slip away.
Not good... stop it already!
Take it!!
Right before the important examination,
Hihi...
T-r-e-a-t-m-e-n-t!
No...
Excuse me...
Or rather, while I'm standing here quietly, what the heck are you doing to the sick person?
W-What did you just say?
Don't get in my way!
Hey, what are you doing?!
I'm licking off his sweat.
Then I'm doing that as well!
Don't copy me!
Huh? There's something hard there...
I was just licking his ear.
Stay still and leave it to me.
I'll definitely make you feel better!
Seriously... It can't be helped then...
Take care...
Tch, I'm so envious of this guy.
Or rather, fail!
Someone as you who got to be nursed by Ako-Riko-senpai has no right to speak!
Alright!
Ahhh! Kanetsugu-sama!
You mean you're shivering, don't you?
It was one year ago, at most.
Your ticket is right here. I've just delivered it, so there's no problem!
Can't I? It's so lonely sleeping by myself...
That's not something a High School student would say...
It should be OK, I was able to remain calm till the end.
What the heck, Keita?!
R-R-R-Riko...
the result announcement for the Tamahide High School.
Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Ah, you are talking about me and Keita's right?
With me!
It's fine, my happiness is Kei-chan's happiness.
Waa, it came off, it came off!
It's finally time.
Yeah, it's finally come.
Have you come to like me, Ako-senpai?
Erm well th- thi-
Keita-senpai!
Sensei, she's your younger sister isn't she?
Isn't that so? Kanetsugu-sama?
We're sorry...
Always troubling you and behaving like a spoiled child.
Despite that... I am sorry for yielding such results!
Kenta!
Erm...
Congratulations...
HEY!
Ako-nee, Riko-nee!
Kei-chan has...
Riko-neechan.
Heeeeehhhhhhh?
Keita-senpai.
Yeah, it's finally finished!
Having lived through these dark days of examination,
What about us?
Ehhh!? Ako-nee! Riko-nee!
Keita-senpai you're stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid!
You promised Mikazuki-chan?
Happinessss...!
Participants, please write down what you want in order, okay?
Let's start with me.
Reach the end!
It's wrong to laugh, it's wr-
Yes, it was me.
Do as you please.
I'm going to begin!
If I remember correctly...
In some way, that's a little rude.
Mikuni, you should also find someone like that soon.
It's okay, I won't mind even if Keita-senpai is a fast one!
Anyway, in the past Keita was already a splendid man.
If you have made a decision, please inform your mother too, OK?
As if that would happen!
And even if I did, why would I tell you?
I thank you up to this point... I will soon become a high-schooler.
Kei-chan...
Keita...
Ako, I could ask you the same thing, don't get in my way!
Keita-senpai, please hand us your buttons!
At least that one...
I'm sorry, Ako-nee, Riko-nee.
Next time how should I face him?
Is that true?
It can't be helped.
omg, gimme that money
Weird...
Between your legs?
Looks like their uniforms are wearing them.
Don't worry, they might be a little too big now, but when you get taller, they'll be a perfect fit.
Riko
I find it even harder to just be constantly ignored at home.
Especially in the morning. T: Morning wood.
But he's also a boy.
Don't say that! You should just try going out with a few other guys.
Feeling proud?
No way.
Not to mention he's... completely ignoring us lately.
Really.
Please! I've had enough of that!
Don't run away.
Where do you think you're going?
First his twin sisters, now he's going after a junior?
She was praying for you to get rejected.
Sorry.
I hope to pass my high school entrance exam.
Besides, I don't believe in Gods.
You've been saving up your entire allowance for this?
You can't do that.
Oh wow. I'll certainly be successful in my entrance exam!!!
Or not... Let me be Oomiya-kun's girlfriend! ...please! - Miki
Us?
Hey, look at this.
I won't let some stranger take my sisters away.
No. Suminoe-kun is... bSorry!
It's limited to breasts.
Are you guys idiots?R: use "retarded" instead?
What are you saying?
I would go this wild on them.
OP
I smell a girl's scent.
I can't take it anymore.
Or did Keita cheat on you?
You shouldn't fall into cheating.
I got wet!R: me too...
Don't suddenly...
Keita: Are you feeling ill?
Don't shake it so hard.
All right! It opened!
Wait a little bit.
What am I supposed to do now?
But...
I am a senior in middle school and I urinated in front of a classmate.
All right!

I really li
I'm Suguru Aizawa's younger brother.
Hey!
Practice has already started.
He's known as Japan's prize.
Comparing my brother to me,
Thanks.
What?
I've come back to Kamakura.
Oh! I have to go to the staff room.
Uh...
The last pass from the slide goes to Kakeru Aizawa's direct left!
Hey! Wait!
Along with that trap earlier,
I won't let you get away!
Oh! It's almost time for the regular selection match!
Or was it this?
The regular selection match will now begin.
Really?
Huh?
I decided it.
That's why you ran away to the manager's position.
Am I wrong, Kakeru?
What does someone who just runs away know about me?
Man...
Hey, Kakeru, look.
Thank you for the game!
But unlike me, my brother, Suguru Aizawa, is truly amazing.
Seven joined the club as a manager
and said, "let's do our best as managers,"
But the white team's sideback has pulled too far back.
Here it comes!
The rest of the offense can't keep up
I'll stop him this time!
But if I fall back, he'll push forward with his dribble.
When the forward moves towards a ball he can't even see yet,
There's no way he'll get it.
I'll get it!
Shoot, Kakeru!
Hey, Nishijima...
He should've shot that with his left.
to read the course of the shot.
Always?
Yeah. We all had huge expectations of him
when he joined the club at the start of middle school,
But, even though he had technique and speed,
I'll definitely put it in!
Sub out, Kakeru.
What? B-But I still...
We're subbing. Shigeo Nishijima, you're in for Kakeru Aizawa!
Between the assist for the first point
His older brother took all the talent with him.
Kakeru?
A forward who can score on a pass like that could play nationally...
That's why Kunimatsu-san, who had been marking Kakeru,
Suguru-san.
Kake-nii's been in love with Seven
Suguru, you come home late every night.
I just really wanted to wear this tonight.
I won't make it to morning practice like this.
so I ran desperately to keep up with you.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
but I'll say it now.
I want to get it off my chest.
he can't win by himself.
A dream?
Kakeru!
They didn't pull off a win,
I can't lose to Seven, so I've got to try my best, too!
Before the approaching inter-high match,
so he should be here, eventually.
What?
I expect you to be prompt.
Right.
Back to practice.
and see if we can convince him to come back to the team?
Chocolate Cornets
What are you doing, Takase-kun?
Asuka-san is called the emperor of Kanagawa, right?
Silva?
Could it be because you, Suguru-san's brother, are here?
Is Michiro-kun home?
You're Michiro-kun's younger sister?
Don't go saying unnecessary things, Chika.
he quit basketball and transferred to soccer in his third year.
so Chika and I should have dinner by ourselves.
I don't like it.
Who could be here at this time of night?
in the darkness where it's hard to see how it will return.
So I can tell that Takase-kun came out to the park
started playing soccer
Kaoru-kun!
Seven!
By the way, where's Kakeru?
so he'd be late.
But, how did you know?
Then I can get right to it.

Decide with your own eyes.
Hey, doesn't something seem weird?

Kanagawa qualifiers second match,
Damn. They're underestimating us.
Hey, Kunimatsu, Yusuke.
His stomach is huge!
Let's end this match in the first half.
They're already in a pinch.
Recruit defense?
He sent it straight to Mako-san's feet from that distance.
The keeper is right-handed.
Yeah!
Another way to say it is,
Unlike the first half, in the second half,
Nakajima has an open path.
Let's substitute Araki-san.
but he can't keep playing.
One more goal.
Yes.
Win your way to the top, Enoshima High.
but am I still looking at my feet?
Here, put this on.
Well?
I'm coming to get it.
Where?

I don't plan on letting you get a single goal.
I'll show you...
She's got problems with her attitude and appearance,

That's strange.

It was not offsides.

That had to be offsides, right?
I didn't know. Really?

Shit! He's riling me up.
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

I can't help feeling excited.

No! He's brought down by Fua's tackle.
He's been removed!

Tsujidou's plays were dirty?
I'm sorry.
You take everything on and try to do it yourself.

What did I just...
Mishima-san, Kakeru-kun's play just now...
Hasegawa, stay behind!
Going for another dribble penetration?
I'm going to leave the SC and play soccer with him.
Ah, yes!
Don't take throw-ins from the far side.
This is turning into an amazing match.
you can't help but admire his efforts!

Yeah! Get out of my way!
Araki gets past him!
Give it up!
That's it, Fua. That's good for you.
Fua, that's your weapon!
A breath taking rebound goal with his whole body!
It's a tie game of 2-2.
We're aiming for nationals, too!
All right!
Kimu will perform his long throw.
You performed that mythical feint in a real game.
Don't give up until the end!
I'm glad you lost!
I won't lose at the championship.
Same here.
That's how we've been playing up until now!
You guys are amazing.

Yes!
When we get back we'll cool down, stretch, and reflect.
It's on me.

You too, Suguru.
Yes, just a friend.
You too, Kakeru, dribbling past Silva like that.
Did you really?
I really did, Robbie.
I went against him myself, so there's no mistake.

Suguru, you're a genius player
Oh, Coach Inaba.
I'll go to cheer you on.
Okay. Understood.
What a slippery woman...

Thank you very much.
You're going already?

Thank you very much.
I won't let you down.

They're a team with an iron defense.

He's past!
but it looks like it's a little short.
he's made it past four defenders and is nearing the penalty area!
I don't even have to get to the goal?
If I'm going in with a dribble, I'm going all the way.
What a side step!
It's clear!
Yes!
Another chance for Enoshima.
Who will Araki use this time?
Understood.
They play well enough, as Suguru suggested.
Takase's header sends it to Hyodo!
He heads towards the middle with a speedy dribble!

Coach Iwaki?

He continues to penetrate!
There goes Mako-san!
No luck, it's cleared!
Kakeru-kun, I'm counting on you.
Yes.
He probably remembered it while watching Kudo-san just now.
Kakeru Aizawa!
I'm a striker.
under tight defense.
He won't get it.
Don't think you can keep the ball!
He, Suguru's brother, hesitated for a moment.
I'm counting on you.
The ball looks like it'll reach the penalty area.
Let's show them the results of our training.
That's true, Kaiouji-kun.
Mako-kun, to the right.
You're planning on taking my free kick from that distance?
Here it comes.
Next time, come at us ready to kill!
This match's first Cannon Free Kick.
Kakeru transforms into what seems like Suguru.
Against the iron defense, Four Rows,
The forward shouldn't be...
Like this, brother?
This is different from before.
Look up!
Now!
What? Why?
He's shooting?
There it goes! Aizawa's middle shot.
Not a lead taking goal.
The first half ends with neither team having scored a point.
My brother taught me.
I'm fine.
Both teams are heading out onto the field.
It's the kickoff for the second half.
Okay.
which means...
They harden their defense with Four Rows
Right, Kakeru?
I don't get it, Yusuke.
and the forwards, Takase and Matoba, also go back to their positions.
He's passed it to Tsukumo.

I'll crush you!
Let your instincts guide you.
With loss time included, there's five minutes left.
You're an amazing guy.
Now 35 minutes have elapsed,
Will Enoshima make it through?
Thank you very much.
I suppose.
So that's how it was.
Let's have a little break.
What's your name?
Independent? What kind?
pick a practice menu and work on
It's not like that! We're just childhood friends.
Never mind!
I, the manager, was suddenly put into the selection match
my brother talked to me about the "knight in the area"
Brother? Where are you going?
A metal pipe puncturing his chest.
The older brother's head injury was also quite serious.
A girl. Aren't you guys glad?
Coach!
and a Nanase.
Nana and Nanase are hard to tell apart, too.
Sir, Suguru-kun is an organ donor, correct?
All right!
How was the match?
We won!
I scored the second point
Nothing in particular.
I'm leaving Japan tomorrow.
One for you and one for Kakeru.
Oh, man.
What is it, Brother?
Just put it on.
Let's take this hat trick!
Kakeru Aizawa
Ah, yes.
so I should be released soon.
Get better and come back to the club.
What?
You know, I'd like to talk it over with my brother one more time.
about his brother.
can you remain calm and listen?
Doctor!
Doctor,
You seem energetic.
How is Kakeru Aizawa-kun?
Okay.
Are you sure,
One more.
Like when I was matched up with Suguru-san,
What about practice?
Suguru-san was the conductor
how did the tournament go?
Suguru-san's definitely not like that.
Accept it, Kakeru!
From a tie, Kakeru's Phi Trick won the game spectacularly.
Yes. Yesterday's match must've been good motivation.
Akira Takajo!
All right.
Yusuke.
Kamakura Hakusan
Kamakura is crushing Hakusan.
They are a team that deserves to take the championship.
This practice match was designed as practice to play against Yoin.
If we lost the ball like that through pass,
What?
We still have time before our next match.
I'm not even tired.
Where to?
What?
Thank you.
Kakerucchi!
Is she your...
Don't be shy.
Thanks again.
Hey, you.
Shut up!
I wonder if I was a little out of line.
Then let's.
What am I imagining?
That's my second.
Huh?
Oops. Didn't I tell you?
With who?
What?
We're counting on you, Enoshima Tower!
This is fine. Just shoot already.
Hey, you, Takase!
Wait.
Where did she go?
Wait a second, Seven!
It looks like they were able to refresh themselves in both mind and body.
We were right to give them a break.
Oh, Asuka-san.
Asuka
You're even called one of the great players of our generation.
That's so hard to believe.
One day, I met a really amazing guy.
and seemed to be made of all the unexpected things
that never made sense to me.
Let's get going, Onimaru.
I see. And you, Mako-kun?

We love you, Asuka-san!

The ref is about to blow the whistle.
It's the kickoff for the semifinals of the
But he's held on to the ball for too long.
Don't get ahead of yourself, first year!
It's mine!
No!
Takase gets the ball.
That's...
Next time, I'll push even harder.
With unmatched athleticism,
Horikawa-kun, he's coming.
You...
I won't let you shoot!
There's no way he can catch that ball.
Are you getting excited yet?
The defender, Ri, holds onto it.
All right. Nice, Kaoru-kun.
Araki shows his worth with a one touch pass.
It's Asuka!
They're taking out their right wing, Matoba,
and you were inviting tight situations.
Kakeru-kun.
I wonder.
Araki-san!
I thought I had completely lost him,
Was that the unpredictability

A long shot?

episode 23: "Desperate Situation."
It's the semifinals against Yoin High,
in which Asuka-san was bait, and tied up the game,
with only moments left in the half.
Yoin is completely shutting down all the Enoshima attackers.
Araki still has the ball, but he's got nowhere to go.
Aizawa shoots!
Enoshima didn't get that goal.
Sawamura moves from the left side to the right,
When Onimaru-kun cuts towards the goal,
we can't prevent them from scoring.
It's all right.
The ball goes from Shiratori to Asuka in the middle.
I knew it.
Onimaru is running up the side... Wait!
In order to lower the risk
not for attack, but to defend the sidelines.
You're not getting through.
But here's Oda.
In a simple one-on-one, this man is hard to shake.
I won't let you. I'll stop you.
Shiratori!
as if he knew this side change was going to occur.
No! This is a long pass to Onimaru on the opposite side.

What a guy.
The burdens we carry are different!
That was the referee's whistle.
After allowing a goal at the end of the first half,
Kakeru is the striker that Suguru was searching for.
I decided that I'll never run away again.
Everyone, you understand the coach's instructions?
You said it.
Let's win this match!
Yeah!
What will you do, Araki?
we cannot easily get behind the defensive line.
Do you remember?
What's wrong? Aren't you attacking?
but Araki is heading into the vital area as well.
Hino is coming in from the right side
What?
So close.
It appears that it's still early for the total defense.
How rare.
and I don't know why, he said he wanted to go in.
He said he ran there, so he didn't need a warm up,
against a strong opponent,
and turned down the youth invitations

Yeah!
but in the penalty area, Asuka-san is marking him.
Oda overlaps and shoots!
I see.
If all goes well.
Oda slowly dribbles into the defense.
It's to Hino?
It connected!
Go!
The tie goal against Yoin!
Kakeru has already accepted defeat in his heart.
Enoshima went up against the powerful Yoin.
but when the ball was entrusted to me,
Yoin pushes past Enoshima again.
The Yoin defense, wary of Enoshima's attack,
Then Araki, with spectacular timing, fed a through pass.
He brought the ball in free and finally Katsuragi scored.
Damn, this isn't easy.
Remember what you just saw.
and sending passes to the front line.
Taking a shot, of course.
you'd choose to shoot.
and, without lifting the ball too high,
Another way to say it is,
That may be true on paper,
Right now, I'm 175 centimeters
up until the start of the attack.
The match might as well be over.
I'll catch you!
His charge injured your knee.
Then consider this:
The defensive midfielder's position.
I'd like to invite you to our team as a playmaker, a regista.
but now I finally understand its importance.
I think,
Oda-san is taking the ball to the left side.
and changing positions with Araki-san
Asuka suddenly intercepts from Aizawa's blind spot,
completely crushing this chance.
so you probably won't play, right?
but Kakeru read ahead and attacked the ball
That wasn't just an accident?
A blind heel pass!
It goes to Araki.
Shake it off, Onimaru.
That's true.
It couldn't be.
of his genius brother's plays, it should be possible.
he played as if he had been possessed, like now.
Coming from the back,
a truly difficult to notice blind spot, he's taken the ball.
one-on-one against the emperor, Tooru Asuka!
It's a pass. Araki goes running in.
But the pass is hard! This is...
We did it! We did it!
Next time on Knight in the Area,

You're right.

Only four minutes plus loss time remain in the game.
Of course!

We can do it!

That's perfect.
He can make it to the cross.
I won't let you shoot.
Kakeru!
and take a shot from inside the area.
He's going for the middle.
Kakeru Aizawa
Mom...
That's life for you.
I told you, I don't...
Cut it out!
I'm fine now.
Here.
Now that I think about it, it was the same situation as back then.
Coach.
Goal!
Araki.
There it goes!
In that moment, we were eliminated.
They aren't thinking it either,
Kakeru?
I thought, "if I run with the ball and get past the defender,"
If I'm the knight in the area my brother talked about,
with all three years of high school behind me.
Right?
Good work, Enoshima!
Enoshima, banzai!
Neither team yielding, the score was 0 to 0 until 10 minutes
But it was a goal.
Kakeru!
Still, we cannot be satisfied yet.
Kota-kun, your legs aren't moving.
Next time on Knight in the Area,
This is the strength of a true prodigy.

What am I doing?
That's enough already.
Nadeshiko has a training camp at Kamakura.
So that's what it was.
It's about Kakeru-kun, right?
Don't you feel like he's grown up so much?
Even if that's true,
Go!

Wha... What?
That's enough for today. Everyone come in.
I'm not very hungry, so...
Yay!
Araki-san!
So you're using the plan
Yes. I was supposed to be in my best condition,
my penalty kick wasn't good enough.
I said tomorrow, right?
W-Wait! Hold on!
Enoshima sure is fun.

She what?
Nothing.

See?
Kakerucchi, do you have one?
What's the point in me hiding?
You think so?

Yeah.
You're welcome.

I can definitely reach!
Yes.

He's the guy from before. So he's a coach.

Everyone's amazing, Brother.
I want to get out on the field soon.
I could've claimed that ball.
Against large, strong opponents,
Yes!
I'll be going ahead.
Yes. Do your best!
in the first half and the pace was slowed.
Kakeru!
I'll be shooting, too.
You're too uptight.
Still, I've moved one step closer to my brother's stage.
He looks pretty nervous.
Relax, Kakeru.
Damn. Next time, definitely.
Huh?
Watch out!
We did it! The first goal!

It's over... It's over... It's all over.
What will happen next?
Normally, Tybalt is supposed to be killed by Romeo, right?
and Thursday will be your funeral.
But this plan was never told to Romeo,
You can do it!
We've been working without food or drink...
We all got a laugh from seeing
that took Romeo down in the previous scene.
If only I had awoken a moment sooner.
Who's plump?
Romeo!
Juliet.
What irony. I did not know that when I...
It's my last wish.
Romeo...
on a huge stage known as "the championships."
I was waiting for this.
as Romeo and Juliet in a play, which turned into quite a riot.
Not at all.
Please don't hold back today.
leave your gear at the camp
and assemble on the field.
and from there straight into an overseas tour.
As you can see,
but isn't it about time for your rebound?
Yes. If the U-16 team
It looks like they'll be making
It'd be a shame
We don't get this opportunity often.
All the guys from Kamakura sure are huge.
We've played against them before.
What choice do I have?
As I expected.
Now, it's a little early, but, Kakeru-kun,
Yes!
I'm hardly tired. That didn't even amount to a warm up.
is becoming more and more apparent.
That was nice of him.
Stop your idiotic fighting.
they were defeated by Yoin
I've recorded the critical moments against Yoin.
Who, me?
Could the fast and accurate passing
be a means of hiding that weakness?
I'd like you to pay particular attention to Yoin's movements.
Given that they were defeated in
and in this years new recruit match,
What's to be scared of?
That's the spirit.
After going through countless matches and winning,
and stay on the team,
but the world is waiting for me.
I keep thinking about everything and I can't sleep.
I can't sleep, so I thought I'd move around a bit.
Me, too!
I guess it's already that season.
Goal!
The older brother continued to improve
Despite desperate treatment,
I'm coming.
That's Akimoto-san.
It's been a few months since the summer competition
and we've returned, powered up:
We'd like to provide you with hot commentary
but thanks to the forward, Naoki Akimoto,
and giving up 0 goals in three games.
However, something might happen in this match
You don't mean...
It's the kickoff!
Opposite side!
Oda gets shaken,
Influenced by the play of Yoin's Onimaru-san.
Okay!
Takase brings the ball down
Enoshima might win with overwhelming goals.
Goal!
Kakeru, did you think that Enoshima would be in trouble?
creating opportunities for goals.
I'd like to test the system for that situation
another performance like the one against Yoin.
Oda-san.
Stop him! Don't let him into the area!
and the first win of the tournament.
I see.
The first opponent he showed at the
U-16 newcomer matches
then it's not completely blocked.
If so, they might lose against them.
their new style of total football,
known as The Little Witch, Nana Mishima,
Mishima's pass goes to Ishiki.
next, will it go to Murasaki in front of the goal?
It was a good attack.
though she's only in high school like Mishima: Mai Murasaki.
She's probably exhausted much of her stamina,
but she's not playing badly.
Look at Mai-chan.
That's the end of the match.
Nana-chan, you did great too, but Mai-chan,
Seven, you did great.
Play well. I'll put you in a great article.
Yeah. I know, but...
Yeah.
This is my personal motivation,
As long as you aren't possessed again.
Even without your concern,
At the semifinals,
finally face Sagamigaura.
The strength of their four rows
and took on the world wearing the blue 10 jersey.
Despite desperate treatment,
I kept believing it. My dream. Our dream!
The Kanagawa High School Championship had finally begun.
first round of qualifiers, Naoki Akimoto,
of the Kanagawa Championship.
making the score 1-1.
I'll take number 12.
He's past the second!
2-1! Aizawa claims a goal with three minutes left.
but your next opponent is often referred to as
Without you, the ace,
we wouldn't be able to win the championship regardless.
If we beat Sagamigaura,
But now that Araki is gone,
Against Shonan, who we only just defeated,
How will we face them?
It's true that Sagamigaura's newly completely Total Foot
is completely different from
Shonan?
I'm filling in as the coach for Shonan, Kidokoro.
Total Foot as best as possible by
proxy Sagamigaura team.
Really?
To be honest, Sagamigaura's Total Foot
was one of my most memorable losses.
I'm sure my players feel the same way.
Yes!
Don't lose to the handicap of missing Araki.
I think we were able to convey to them
they lost 2-0.
Enoshima versus Sagamigaura
a6Uh... Then we'll have Fukushima announce
a6Then starting with the Enoshima eleven...
holding on to one key of the match: the regista, Ryoma Oda!
Go for the goal!
would be to stop the Tendo brothers.
New Total Football uses a ball hunting technique,
As Sagamigaura comes in for the ball hunting,
He keeps the ball and heads into a dribble.
Kaoru-kun!
But using the same strategy,
Yes!
It's about time you gave up that ball.
Let the hunt
Enoshima continues to get sucked into
Or so it should have been.
The younger, Kakeru,
having sustained great injury to his heart,
There was only one path to survival: a heart transplant.
and his proud will.
thanks to Hibino-kun and his team,
is in the exchange between slow and fast, long and short.
He shoots!
A direct would definitely have gone in.
Yeah.
That number 14
Ri-san, nice save.
where would you aim?
It's mine!
The ball isn't stopping yet.
have gone in.
We've been saved by Aizawa's instincts again.
Still, to think they'd change sides from a corner kick
that series of plays with direct volleys.
by using the accuracy and speed of direct passing,
they are able to control the speed of the game at will.
This will be harder to deal with than we thought.
If we let them shoot any more,
Kaiouji!
Crap! Mako-san!
line as if pushed forward by a wave.
I'll stop you!
Wasn't this guy a defender?
Due to the fast change over,
Tsuguhide!
We did it, Kazuhide.
Don't ease up yet!
I won't allow a single goal!
Most importantly of all, these guys love soccer more than anyone.
To change high school soccer.
and change everything!
Of course, Coach.
Really now.
so what are you all looking so gloomy for?
Oda, Kaiouji, that's not right.
The distance between posts is 7.32 meters.
to stop any ball that tries to go through there.
I was naive.
That's right.
and cried tears of frustration.
We definitely can't lose.
Araki.
Huh?
There's no mistake.
But the important player here is
He used to play as a defender for a youth team.
Is that right?
You'll be the messenger for the strategy
and go in at the next ball out.
When that blue sky shines through,
Sagamigaura demonstrates its storm.
Enoshima finally cracks the new Total Foot's mystery.
Before the spiraling whirlwind of the new Total Foot,
the enemy's Achilles' heel.
In that case...
In order to pull off what Iwaki-chan called the "eye of the typhoon,"
It depends on Oda.
The only troublesome opponent is Rindo-san.
The game is starting to get interesting.
Just like Asuka said, that long feed turned into a goal.
Let's show them.
We can't lose.
Now it's Enoshima's turn!
We'll claim this.
The ones who'll win...
Go!
It's good!
The usually cool Oda celebrates with a fist in the air!
Concentrate!
Hold the front line and keep them out of the zone!
I'll never give it up.
We did it!
Nice game. Good work.
but even as such a time as this...
Wait, it's Ishiki!
Try to understand, Mai-chan.
the U-16 Championship Finals were broadcast live via satellite.
A few years from now,
If my brother were still here, he would've been a sure thing, right?
Seven...
Where my brother was
Your opponent is Yoin.
However, there is no great difference in
in other words, passion.

This is the Enoshima High uniform.
Yeah...
Feel the Youth of Adolescence! Now! Join the Tennis Club!
Word in edgewise? Machine gun?
No, thanks.
Coach!
Enoshima High FC
Congratulations. I permit you to join the club.
And I'm one away.
Kota-kun?
which fall under the governance of the school.
Araki-senpai...
If they knew the truth, they'd quit, wouldn't they?
I'm from the comic duo research club.
The soccer club?
What?
It'll hit the glass!
Together we're...
That was fast!
Mako, focus on just the comedy club already.
Ryuichi Araki?!
Kakeru, keep it together!
Yes, congratulations on getting in.
I'm in the comedy duo research club.
is a f-fat comedian...
if you were to join the club, what are your goals?
Right.
and win the World Cup.
Given the chance, this year
Yes. I failed the SC test,
All right! We've made it to 11 members!
don't get your hopes up.
It's not the kind of club that a play-for-fun club can beat.
Cut it out!
He despised me.
let's start with some beach soccer scrimmage.
Okay!
I'll take that!
would go and run straight over?
I've never seen a team use such bold moves.
Brother, this team's soccer is so much fun!
What are you looking at?
You wear soccer shoes all the time?
They're evenly matched, so far.
You shouldn't be so stubborn. Come back.
They covered us completely,
they'd counter with another point.
but I know of an even better pass.
But, unable to obtain a decisive feeling,
against whom the FC will compete
While in comparison...
As if that's really your intent.
Ryoma Oda.
Finally, the conductor for the team,
Akito Horikawa,
The players to take note of on this team are...
There aren't any?
but if we win this match, our roles will reverse.
Don't worry, Sawamura-san.
compared to last year,
I'll take that.
Yes. Having Kakeru pull the defense
If you think you can break through this iron wall,
Kakeru!
Don't get flustered!
That wasn't luck.
What an amazing jump!
Oda clears the ball...
Don't leave him open.
The keeper, Kurebayashi, dives...
Nice clear.
As if!
Coach, isn't there anything we can do?
Goooal!
They are against a play-for-fun team, after all.
and hardened their defense.
Shit!
This is because...
you will never beat me.
Let's go to the hospital immediately.
Right, everyone?
And why are you half-naked?
I'm sorry. I quit. Please don't look for me. Kota Nakatsuka
See ya!
doesn't change how we play soccer.
That's so strict.
Mako-kun.

So they were planning on Hino breaking through on the left side,
That's as far as you go, Hino!
Idiot.
can push towards the goal.
He will be able to break through that iron wall defense.
I'm counting on you!
You won't get a shot!
It's Aizawa!
has suddenly taken control of the ball!
Goooal!
You did it! Amazing, Kakeru!
A striker!
All right!
Could this be their chance?
One more point. We'll definitely tie it up!
So close, Hino.
Kudo, to the right!
Coach, if things keep going...
We still have an ace up our sleeve.
The long awaited magician's numerous wonderful plays
The Enoshima High School traditional match
SC scores another goal.
The score is now 3-1!
Not yet! It isn't over yet!
Enoshima High FC announces a substitution.
Number 10, Ryuichi Araki, has returned!
Probably the result of careful dieting
I'm sorry I made you worry, Mako.
the flow of the match
3 to 2!
Ryuichi Araki claims a goal with amazing skill!
If they send a pass out, get back immediately, got it?
He only just got on the field,
but it seems like he's been playing the whole time.
Take it!
then you can do it, Kakeru!
The SC had better not let their guard down.
FC still has a chance.
The corner kicker is none other than that man,
That guy gives me the chills.
The striker's stage.
Our defenses, which, up until now, had retreated
Don't just repeat what we do in practice.
Mako, back him up!
I haven't had a match this exciting in so long.
A heel pass?
He's been on defense the entire time,
We're in overtime.
Five minutes have been added to the clock.
Will the winning goal be scored by SC or by FC?
A nice save by the goal keeper, Kurebayashi.
Nakatsuka makes a gutsy play, a corner kick!
Go SC! Go FC!
keep playing with everyone.
At the end of the match, Kakeru hits an overhead.
we tied up the score.
That's the game.
So close, Kakeru.
And a ch-chocolate cornet...
Showing splendid effort and leadership,
and claiming multiple assists, Ryuichi Araki-kun.
This reminds me, Iwaki-kun,
Because of the division in disposition
between me, the director, and you, the coach,
the team broke in two.
After today, SC is disbanded as well.
You be the director, Iwaki-kun.
It's the only way I could atone
Kakeru.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine!
It's... a... secret!
Firstly, to everyone once from FC,
And so, the Enoshima Soccer Club has started anew...
but Sawamura-san saved the situation.
What?
Yes. We'd like to borrow the strength of the "little witch."
do you know how much we'd improve?
it's the same as quitting.
The fact that you're thinking that much about it
By the way, Hyodo,
You're talking about Araki-kun?
Uh, and besides,
It isn't "I have to do something,"
which helps the growth of the team
That's too soft!
Oh, hello.
Okay, Ryuichi?
Wait up!
Then I'll give you just one hint.
Figure out why "run with the ball" is your weapon.
Nope, I just don't know.
Thank you, but I'll be fine.
I won't run away again, like last time.
Kakeru works up a sweat at tough practices,
What do they mean by "confrontational"?
an8Sorinozuka, you're spraying soup everywhere.
Some kind of a joke?
I guess I'd say that it isn't not tasty...
If you're doing something silly again, I'm gonna get mad.
Now, now...
Why are you apologizing to me?
No, no.
Delivery for you.
It's a wise tranny!
Hello?
Watanuki's class has a quiz next week.
Time left? You have something to do later?
Perry.
Huh?
so I studied on my own.
He's still thinking about that?
So I can't participate this time.
Then let's begin the first game!
Probably not.
There could be bugs inside?!
Well, ah... You have to guess.
Karuta?
She's good!
Team Watanuki-Karuta Pass
Go on, then!
But I get freaked out easily.
Team Nobara-Sorinozuka Pass
This is going to be difficult...
I'm a delinquent, and delinquents have no favorite...
Where would Karuta like to go for a date?
What does Nobara Yukinokouji's favorite word...
You're really getting into this!
If I had to pick one,
I guess I really do have that preference.
She also avoids spicy food or
She generally sleeps seven hours a night.
All right!
Want to continue by yourself, Watanuki?
On edge?
The winner gets a Blu-ray recorder.
Yeah, it isn't like that.
You're getting further from the original objective!
Don't tell me...
Wh-What's going on?
into the Inter-High competitions.
All that's left is to keep practicing everyday
so I still continue my busy schedule
All right. We'll be playing football today.
What're we going to do?
Yes. I'll play for the boys' team.
Oh, man.
Keep making excuses like that
Do you remember our promise with Suguru-san?
Th-This is...
The Little Witch, is a high school idol?
It's the title of a newspaper article about Mishima-san's success.
No, no. I've assigned them a separate menu for today.
I have to say, I'm frustrated... and angry.
It's "little witch"!
That was never even a question.
Said she can see where the "little" in "little witch" comes from.
She's fast!
Mina's amazing!
Mina! Mina! Mina!
and cuts through Japan's defense!
Could representing Japan
It's out...
but the loose ball goes to Mina again!
As if being sucked in, the ball gravitates towards the goal...
Nana! Nana! Nana!
Too easy!
They pushed forward and then defended.
What's more,
a6suits you very well.
What am I doing?
Hey!
Eventually I earned recognition,
I wanted to play soccer.
It's really okay.
but someday, without a doubt...
Yeah...
Who do you think you are?
You're the disgusting one, bitch!
ls the medical team here yet?
His outraged fans are rushing to the location.
Right.
The reward for each adult is the same as always.
The stink from the corpses makes my eyes water all the time.
lt's no wonder l always stink.
Sure.
Your generosity makes me feel weird.
l knew you'd say that.
Hey, buddy! Give us the ball!
You asked Kanie where l worked part-time?
What?
You?
Sure.
They look weird, yet really beautiful.
They'll be here in a few minutes.
Search every square inch of the room!
Mr. Kanie gave me the wrong target.
lt's not my fault.
Come in.
Sawa...
Five years...
He was bribed to ignore the illegal activities of a big corporation.
You punk!
Don't even try it!
Who the hell was that prosecutor?
Didn't Kanie tell you that?
That guy had a gun...
ls Sawa with you?
l'm taking her with me.
You punk! You caused me quite some trouble...
Hang on!
Don't move!
Hobby?
Your act really scared me.
l look better with pencils than with guns.
l just realized, Mr. Akai...
This place.
My hand!
Why?
Do you know how long l've waited for this moment?
You're special, you know.
Who do you think you are?
Your stinking perfume makes me sick!
Do you hear me, punk?
I really don't need anyone else to cause me trouble...
There's another one besides me...
My wife just isn't good enough, you know?
Surprised?
You look good in that uniform.
Can I ask you something?
Some of my classmates are fans.
But I didn't know that he had a twin brother.
Where do I get him?
No.
You killed the client.
Of course not.
I brought some.
What kind of question is that?
Sawa...
The one in pieces...
A cop from the SWAT team.
What do I have to do with that?
You promised to do two more jobs, didn't you?
Gross hobby.
The place where we made you kill for the first time.
Right?
The one who killed Kanie was me.
The two of you tricked me...
Why?
What do you mean, "why?"
It's fine...
All right! Negotiations complete! And so...
Hira, Katsu!
Yeah, it's all the same to me.
Dude, this is fun!
However, if you do not surpass those limits,
My perv radar totally went off.
Wait, are you asking me ou
I'm sorr
Sensei, please calm down!
Ready? And... go!
i1You'll be able to get back your pain.
Sonozaki Noriko.
I-I'm sorry.
Sonozaki-san, was it?
Um, what am I doing here
But I believe that in modern Japan, where working connections with others are held in high regard,
Wanna go to karaoke?
How did this conversation even get to that?
Yes, Katsuhira-kun?
The Imbecile. I'm really pissed off but I don't have the facilities to change it
Ise?
Because you don't express pain,
Huh?
Huh?
i1Gomorin?
What do you mean by being "bound by wounds"?
And that experiment is known as the Kizuna System.
Kizuna System?
Uh, well...
However, there are limits to a person's imagination.
I just can't deal with conversations like these.
We were able to confirm that everyone's wounds were successfully connected.
Maki-san?
I still don't really comprehend the Kizuna System,
If you can swallow a crazy situation like this so easily,
Hiya.
Since that day...
I wonder what that'll feel like.
It's like it was never there. i guess that works? hard to make this compute with his earlier comment
And our Kizna are about to disappear.
You got to make some good memories over your last summer break, didn't you?
C'mon, where's the problem? Ain't summer the season when all sorts of things go berserk?
Just until the end of summer, right?
but I can't find her.
Sorry!
It's not just that!
Because I...
Nori-chan?
Nori-chan!
That's not good.
Continuing the experiment is financially unfeasible.
You guys!
I might be able to see Nori-chan.
She just lost consciousness.
About Nori-chan, about Nori-chan and me...
the number of children gathered from researchers and sponsors involved with the project was nineteen.
And then, the experiment started.
So I did some thinking, and I guess...
The impact you feel when you run...
Katsuhira-kun?
Weren't you just denied last time?
Hisomu-kun, you ididididididiot!
The girl had always been alone
What? You have to remember!
Katsuhira-kun must be exhausted after all this. too short to fit the iroiro in
I see...
Correct!
Could I check my answers with you?
It was like they showed no emotions...
i1Because... that feeling isn't mine at all!
even though it was supposed to be inside of Sonozaki-san. dame dess, ianu
I heard it's a good idea to have ambient music on in the background when you're trying to think.
Splash, splash, splash...
Yaamada...
Because you exist inside of me, Nori-chan.
Well, could you save that for after class?
Get talking already.
I thought about a lot of things, and I might actually be Ise udon. alright, fine
Because... When you're with friends, you can have fun and support each other...
Yeah... I think I feel the same way.
but I didn't really feel all that much.
Were you scared? Was it tough on you?
I had friends.
an8Agata?!
But for Katsuhira-kun, whose feelings were all but gone,
can only keep people connected for a limited period of time.
Thank you.
Katsuhira-kun, you were able to find it...
an8Bearing that pain alone is a terribly sad thing,
If the Kizna System spread throughout the world...
What's the meaning of this?!
You know, we weren't wrong after all.
Nori-chan has always been lonely, ever since she was little.
But that's...
What?
Go!
For crying out loud...
Just give it up already!
Because he's your friend?
then it's just like Nico saidIf Kacchon wants to save Sonozaki-san, then I want to save her too.
Hey, you people...
Huh?
Because we were... friends?
That's so mean!
Why don't you just connect through the Kizna System if you don't understand?
but it seems as though you had something that allowed you to communicate from the very beginning.
Chidori...
I did love you back then, Nori-chan.
You were kind, cheerful, and the way you smiled was all lopsided. squishy?
But the love I feel for you now is a bit different from what it was back then.
And it's not just me, but all of us.
He's right, Nori-chan!
i1I'll be alone...
i1Please give everyone their pain back!
It's pounding, stinging, throbbing...
Though I guess the explosion took a chunk out of it.
Then I won't have to worry about pests flocking to you.
No, she's not that kind of woman...
Um...
Why are you smiling?
Yeah, that sounds nice and chaotic.
So they're going to turn this facility into a park, huh?
They just didn't have the money to tear it all down.
Because I want to really know what you and all the others are thinking.
It was in the lost and found at the mall.
Seriously...
the only one precious to me is Nori-chan.
Maki Honoka. Sugomori High School, Class 2-A.
And that's that!
Are you certain that is all? i think it's okay not to translate "itou" the same way twice here
an8That is incorrect.
an8Now...
We have conducted thorough research on all of you.
Think before you hit me again!
May I ask something?
and Agata-kun continues to sustain damage...
an8The wound that connects you all
I forgot to mention this.
Since that's decided, let's go back to the room Agata's in
Tenga-kun?!
of dogs!
Yeah. I think I got most of it...
I see you haven't changed.
Right. So there's nothing that I don't want to say...
Your wound-bound friends are waiting for you. hf with this
You guys gotta spill the beans already!
She's getting away!
Nico...
W-Well, I mean...
I was on the chubbier side... until the end of middle school.
More like on the chubbiest side! gosh please tell me if i went too commie on this
Katsuhira!
Stop!
What?!
You used sing Momotaro song spoofs!
You were funny!
It hurts after all!
Someone's existence within you?
I never realized that Chidori loved me.
What the heck's going on?
They're fluttering! And sparkling!
My secret.
Huh? Er, right!
i1Kacchon...
I don't think I've ever met anyone less qualified to talk about things making sense. gouriteki up in this bitch
Be my guest.
Listen up, dude.
Ow!
Ow!
That's not it!
Then what is it?
Yuta, what happened to your left hand?
You dummy!
It was so funny, Nico took a pic
Where are you? Get your ass out here!
I have an appointment I need to attend.
Why, youLook, I was kidding! I'm not gonna violate you!
I have no need for candy.
Well, that's basically the only thing we all have in common...
He's not answering.
Maybe something happened that made him want to disappear, and so he tried to.
So what's the reason here?!
Hey! You're hitting too hard!
That was...
He's really handsome!
He's the type I wish would stay a shut-in forever...
If that's how he's gonna be...
His voice sounded close that time.
Why are you chasing me?
That's some name, isn't it?
I feel like... I want to connect too...
Are you all the "helping" type too, or something?
Yeah! And your body doesn't belong to just you anymore!
After him! We have to convince him
Oh... Sorry about that.
That's enough.
Personally, I prefer Lumonde.
A masochist?!
Question. I'd like you to elaborate on your definition of "masochist".
The sort of sudden pain that befalls me when I least expect it...
But now that we've met each other, I think I'll find fresh pain to savor.
I told you, it's not psychological.
What's your impression? there's not enough time to do what I want, so whatever
Yup.
Hm?
Other than you, we were brought together all at once.
And I'm not the least bit jealous!
Yamada'd totally get his freak on with it. sheet mang
Hey, are you sure Tenga has nothing to do with this?
Um...
Why did you suddenly come to school? actually, it's their last day before vacation
So you've got to tell us beforehand when do something surprising like that, okay?
I won't let them off the hook till I get your money back!
This is your new mission.
Why fried rice?
We're not done talking!
Goodbye.
You! You used to be a fatty, right?
I have no intention of warning you at all.
Smirking?
You're too trusting. Or rather, your sense of danger is terrible.
Wait, you sure it's okay for me to have this?
Yeah. Go ahead.
You didn't even hesitate.
Well, let's have some fun while we're stuck in here!
Let's play a word chain.
yu no hana
ryouri kenkyuuka
kanaami
Look, you...
The Kizna Committee, which I am a member of, we're turning this into Kizna too, right?
That's not all.
In Sugomori, normal members of the Kizna Committee work behind closed doors.
I always wondered about those Gomorins that are creeping around everywhere...
But there have been a lot of people leaving Sugomori lately.
an8You can't be serious about building a project city on a slogan as broad as "true world peace".
Wasn't that because Agata invited her?
Oh, s-sorry...
You're an idiot, aren't you?
It should be a bit harsher
Hey!
So immature... i like it
and Tenga-kun.
Huh?
It's all because you stuffed me in a pressure cooker! it's a joke you fucking script scrubbers
What? But that's dangerous!
What the hell are those things?
Didn't you
Well, anyway, isn't Takashiro just one helluva girl?!
Man, it's not often you find a winner like
You should have said something.
No, I'll make due with these.
Show us what you got as an ex-fatty!
Sonozaki-san,
You like my chest, right?
Normal?
Our homeroom teacher.
Our school counselor.
So our teacher and school nurse are both members?
Are you Kizna Committee people even sane?
Nori-chan...
A graveyard?!
What?! You should've said that sooner!
an8I really got all the bad luck...
an8U-Um...
an8and there's no guarantee they'll release us from this Kizna thing.
an8H-Hey, don't obsess over it so much.
an8We're bound by our pain too.
Even Yoshizawa's personality is max painful!
The money you stole from Kacchon!
These are their brainwaves, as observed during their mission to find Hisomu Yoshiharu.
My tummy feels heavy, and every step we take it keeps getting worse and worse and worse... I actually didn't read this line before my edit just above
I'd rather feel straight-up pain than this.
I think so.
I twisted my ankle when I was trying to run from Kamaishi-kun.
What's that mean...
Hey, Yoshizawa!
Looks like we're on the way up,
More.
Huh?
Ruru!
The real problem is Sonozaki.
Sonozaki! What the hell's up with you people, having Takashiro assaulted?!
No way!
Are you stupid?
And finally, the government's growing impatient as well.
We named them Deadly Sins, but none of them actually live up to that name.
Yuta? What's wrong?
You can do whatever you want with the movie.
It has nothing to do with me anymore.
Since we're just a small publishing company,
My editing career is on the line here too, with this movi
Hey, Honoka-chan,
I found you because I got that churning feeling in my stomach.
It's hard to tell, but perhaps something is happening to cause them constant pain.
It was super popular in my class.
But I think after just the debut volume, the author...
That and the content's shock value made the manga a runaway success for a while.
Then she's really a murderer?!
Argh! Screw her, damnit!
No way! Why are they at our school?
My name is Atsugi, and I'll be interviewing you throughout the day.
S-Sue? Oh, come on.
Hey! What are you You can't just film us!
Are you okay, Maki-san?
Let's start with asking the students here.
The doctors told us that she wouldn't live long.
Hey, if she died 'cause of that illness, it wasn't Maki's fault at all, right?
Ruru was so painfully shy, and that girl was the first friend she ever had!
Kacchon!
But you were hurting too, Niiyama-san,
i1Hey!
What's wrong?!
Sorry.
Come on man, let it happen. Maybe you'll catch some of his natural hot guy germs.
You should get in on this too, Katsuhira!
You've really changed, Kacchon.
What?
S-See? It was too sudden.
Wouldn't that be even harder?
Her heart was moved, after all.
What do we do with these?
Well, putting the other chapters aside, there's not much I can learn from the last one.
Read it.
The last chapter.
We can split up into teams and go after each other with 'em!
This isn't going to work.
Huh?
Come with me, Takashiro-san!
I don't want to drown, so I'll decli
Geh! It's even stuck in here!
Looks like you have your answer.
We share our pain, we share our emotions, and that...
Chidori,
Yuta,
Um... Katsuhira's my given name, not my family name.
Stop that! Come on, save me please!
First time I've seen a color like this.
It's the color of emotions...
I can not understand. as in 'unable to'. I'm picking nits to change stuff, however, it's vital to have the difference
Actually, I haven't taken that many myself, but...
More importantly,
why on a day like this?
I don't want people thinking I'm an idiot too.
Everyone's so worked up.
Hisomu! Katsuhira!
with the help of various corporate sponsors and the Japanese government.
At first, most of the inhabitants were researchers involved with the Kizna Experiment,
I still think that's weird.
They can't exactly tell society about connecting people through their wounds.
But the instant we moved on to humans, trouble appeared every step of the way.
Isn't that a noble undertaking?
Hold it right there, Tenga. Stop it.
no matter what.
an8We're gonna split them up into units.
The zone we should keep a close eye on... is here.
For now, the next pairing should be...
If Katsuhira-kun has been able to get back his pain,
God damn you, Hisomu!
That pain was actually rather enjoyable...
I'm the one who's awful.
I think they're done chasing us...
K-Kacchon!
About you not finishing your broccoli this morning?
i1But if I fall from a place that high and it still doesn't hurt...
Rather than an extra, you're more like an extract.
So what's the subtitle for next week?
This pain... It's Chidori, isn't it?
How can you tell it's Chidori?
He left...
I couldn't help it, it was two against one.
Damn it...
Oh, that makes sense... What should we do?
How much do you think about me throughout the day?
But ever since I became a Kiznaiver, I've been able to see it more clearly.
Could it be that you and I, too, are bound by our wounds?
Hey, wait!
Weren't you the prime example for that, Urushii?
This pain...
Kacchon...
Something...
i1That irritates them.
I don't know.
It wasn't just the two of us.
Asuka, Shiori, Pon-chan, Tonko...
Yes.
I'm sure... that must be the case.
That ain't just a girl! She's the enemy!
Nico?!
Please! Let me go!
It's Chidori's voice!
Please, let go of me already!
Don't give me that shit!
So what if I love Chidori?! ravu
I don't want to hear that from someone who's never even washed their eye mask once, Yamada-sensei!
Movie
Right? Thus we have Araragi Koyomi.
That's more of a surprise than aliens?!
They say it's a very beautiful blonde woman
yet she has no shadow.
If I had friends, I'd have to care about them.
When they're happy, you'd be happy too.
I'll be heading to the library now.
Wanna come along?
Are you okay?
I am Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade,
It's fine.
an8Can you imagine any honor greater than this?
I can get away from this.
Thank you.
Not feeling it right now.
Fool!
Call me Heart-under-blade.
Where are we?
A suitable place to withdraw to.
That's way too long.
I turned into a vampire, right?
That's not what I meant.
Therefore I took a form I could sustain.
Still better than perishing.
I could at least regenerate the form, if not the power to fill it.
You are but a newborn as a vampire.
Oh.
Do you really understand?
All who have their blood drunk by a vampire will, without exception, turn into vampires.
I am far from my full potential.
They have yet to finish me off.
I have no chance of standing against them now.
Won't I just get slain instead?
Now that I am weakened to a bare minimum,
while I am still a top-class vampire, you could still kill me.
but those three managed to take your limbs when you were whole and at full power.
How could I
Your stare's sharp.
Failing to do the right thing is the sign of cowardice.
Don't worry.
I'm no vampire slayer or specialist.
Is that all you remember of me?
How did it go?
They're together. It's not happening.
Why did you help Kiss-shot and me?
but I doubt you'd be on our side either.
Consider that my job.
Between us and those three?
It's like I'm watching bullies get their way.
Of course, since it's my job, I'm not gonna do it for free.
Trying to convince those three is futile.
If we can at least communicate, we can play a game.
Firstly, we need to separate them.
and Araragi can get back your limbs.
then I'll shoulder it.
Before that, let me confirm one thing.
Or is such a physique common amongst humans?
could you possibly be referring to?
Taking a walk, I suppose?
Spanish?
Good idea.
isn't it about time you went home?
You shouldn't walk around
I guess I'm at an age when I want to seek out the extraordinary.
where did this come from?
I was after your assets!
And don't mess with my phone, either.
How's that!?
But it seems it was a vain attempt.
There was no way for me to cut you down.
Well, for now,
I'm sorry it took me so long to notice.
But I want to help you!
That's a lie.
At the very least, you seemed like you were enjoying yourself when we spent time together.
Are you shitting me? I told you, I was only after your assets!
Horny!
Huh?
I'm so sorry I said all those horrible things!
Allow me to dine in peace. Have you no manners?
Yeah, I did think that...
That girl is of a precious lineage, Araragi.
Oshino,
You shouldn't doubt her like that.
But...
Oi, come on now. What's with that face?
I was seeking out a change from my daily grind.
I suppose I was just trying to escape reality for a while.
When I saw you from behind yesterday, I got the strangest feeling that it wasn't you.
the bodies of other men?
This is about all I can do for you anyway.
Not at all! A friend in need is a friend indeed!
feel free to let me know, okay?
Oh, I know! I can tidy up this classroom.
Hmm?
but Kiss-shot,
You-
Above all else, it seems Episode holds an extreme hatred towards vampires.
Mist is just a form of water.
That's enough!
It was a matter of payment.
Araragi?
He is just a human. Pure and simple, through and through.
It is fact that my two arms were plundered by that man.
If Dramaturgy does it as a job,
It is not for me to be saying this, but religion can be quite troubling.
How's your gut wound, Hanekawa?
You're getting a bit ahead of yourself.
Here, have a Coca-Cola.
As for me I'll have a Diet Cola.
If not, you'd be the envy of girls everywhere.
You probably shouldn't come around here anymore.
Well, I was thinking the same myself.
I mean it differently than before.
But it's different now.
Frankly, it's creepy.
I don't get it at all!
When the new term starts, at that school.
What was that sound?
And by fall, do you mean
but in exchange
My bad. I messed up.
claim to be human.
PPlease...
It's not as unlikely as you think.
No good. I'm not going to show you today!
What are you looking at, Araragi-kun?
What? Is it the kind of book you can't show?
Could it possibly be an indecent book?
It's unfortunate but, today I only studied Spanish.
What do you think we could do to end bullying?
You irritate me.
I'm alone because I like it.
Don't follow me around.
Up until before, weren't we having fun chatting?
So, please dissapear somewhere else.
I've become strong.
in my duel with Doramatsurugi as well...
it's not something I could bear.
I thought I had a chance to win, but...
if I say this will you be satisfied?
I got a right leg.
that you were forced into a situation that you had to say those things
You're very pushy you know.
Can you see them properly?
Hey?
an8TL Note: Meme uses the Japanese word which basically means "5 body parts", this has a few meanings, such as the head, neck, chest, arms and legs, but in this case he went with the meaning of the head, both arms and both legs, but they didn't take the head, so this is more like "4 body parts", but unfortunately that would also mean "corpse" in Japanese, so he may have taken that into account.
Hey, hey, what's with that face?
Well then, it might be my fault, mightn't it?
I felt like I wanted change in my life.
That's not the case.
You're right.
Guu.
Not really that different to a human.
But, it does somewhat feel as though your muscles are more elastic, I guess.
that's more than enough.
don't hesitate to let me know what, okay, Araragi-kun?
Wait, I'll pull out that memory right away.
What memory did you pull out?
Above all, it seems Episode holds an extreme hatred towards vampires.
That really gets me!
No, it's nothing.
I don't want to say anything.
Your opponent is mist after all!
Araragi-kun...
That really gets her.
OOshi..
You sure seem lively, Araragi-kun.
the duel is clearly over.
Look. He's already fainted.
If that's the case, say so from the start!
I'd have paid three million!
Use your head a bit, Araragi-kun.
Hanekawa-chan.
As far as you can take it, it's just harder for me to die than it was up until now.
You could call him human, right?
Indeed.
Oh, thank you.
Please, don't get wounded please.
We've talked about human-ness, haven't we.
Hanekawa-chan, I...
Araragi-kun, so much so that you'd be taken completely aback.
I'm looking forward to that from the bottom of my heart.
That was close, that was close.
Not at all! I don't know what you mean.
Give them back when the new semester starts, ok.
We're not talking about whether I need them or not, right!?
I'd like you to refrain from that.
These pants will part from your body for the rest of eternity!
I can't return your pants, but
need to return home.
and do what?
Got it.
Araragi-kun.
But,
isn't all that unusual.
You can't see them today.
I don't I don't I don't
Taking a stroll?
What are you reading, Araragi-kun?
They would taint your soul.
That's all.
People are learning their whole lives.
but there's always a possibility...
Huh?
SSorry!
Shit.
What are you doing, Dramaturgy?!
I cannot hunt you.
It's my fault for making you saying that.
You're in a situation that forces you
If you're thirsty, say so!
Your body!!
and we can make up.
If you want, I can take my blouse off too.
You can't just swap them, can you?
That girl is a special case, Araragi-kun.
Oshino.
then you should.
Araragi-kun.
I'm still grateful.
Your muscles became more defined.
Yeah, my bad.
Hurry up and put on a shirt.
Thank you very much.
DoDon't worry about it!
can't you give me more details?
I remembered.
Above all, Episode bears a strong hatred towards vampires.
I'm the what?
Araragi-kun, be quiet...
Your opponent turns into fog...
Hilarious.
But But
Two million?
Power has been restored to my whole body.
He is, for all intents and purposes, a mere human.
Close but not quite.
No, I'm good.
Lately, things have changed.
I have no intention of letting that happen!
I wouldn't have the confidence
I don't think there's anyone more selfish than I am!
I almost fell in love.
Says the guy who buys dirty magazines.
Geez...
No! No! No!
will be my life's purpose.
Araragi-kun,
SSorry, Araragi-kun, I
What are you going to do with Hanekawa?
How unsightly.
Shall we begin?
In other words, the fight ends as soon as it begins.
Die, my master!
Iyan.
If I buy it,
Sound fair?
I said exactly that, not ten seconds ago.
Anyway, can I give you 500 yen?
Later, sure.
Many say "meh". Honey, say "huh".
an8Literally "Feather River"
It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel.
What? My name is... What? My name is... What? My name is...
Sure, I could see, but I wasn't focusing on it or anything.
Hank.
Such foolishness!
How if you sorosoro went home?
Maa, I was intending to hop on home even without it being said,
there's a slim chance that I might get to meet a famous fansubber.
I guess I feel following them on Twitter is the next step in anime fandom.
I'm sorry! I think I must have touched your ki ni?
I'll be able to best Crunchyroll.
That all you got before the might of funi?
I hate you, Dad.
What...
You're probably not Kankei.
Watermelon,
I'm sorry it took so long for "kizu" to show up!
That they'd make a real change in the industry!
really be recreated so FFFast?
it probably can.
Did something good happen?
No, wait, that doesn't add up.
you were out looking for fansubbers of your own volition.
I suppose I was just trying to escape reality for a while.
But I'd much rather be Nishinoya.
Well, but...
wait a chotto
SNAFU! Das a fine Dakara.
Uh?
is already too much.
Titan.
So, what's all this then?
Despise?
half-subbers are not readily accepted by anime society.
10 o'clock!?
You gotta use your head. Get it? GET IT?
Why are you trying to crawl up inside me so tenderly?
My bad, Hank.
forbidden jutsus.
They're just a fansubber group. Pure and simple, through and through.
That being said, I did have my guard down at that time.
Heavens forbid! Not according to our Scientists!
Commie?
And it's all the Cartel's fault!
NNot at all!
Bad English is not an "authentic" translation!
We're cunning and stubborn as all hell.
But I firmly believe that good, flowing English
is entirely possible without honourifics.
Even though you don't know how to put Twitch emotes into a sub?
Err...
Ayaya! Ayaya!
My apologies. I cannot return these.
Araragi,
Arararararararagi...
I...
It's just like the Coke label said. If you knew the real me, you'd be disillusioned.
!!!
!?
!?
!?
That's quite a grudge you got there.
In Guillotine-Cutter's defence, though,
Guillotine-Cutter,
But going up against them was me,
a guy whose entire combat experience can be chalked up to tussling with his little sisters.
Heart-Under-Blade wasn't operating at full power?
but I'm glad you did ask.
You're quite perceptive, every now and then.
She was not in possession of that heart
Probably not.
wasn't Guillotine-Cutter.
Meant to, yes.
have been reclaimed.
It has been two weeks, after all.
It must've been rough, eh?
Well then, Araragi.
it's easier for them to encounter one again.
But what's transpired has transpired, what's done is done.
he left in the afternoon.
I'm sorry to rain on your parade,
Ah.
However, dear servant,
I'm sure there's lots for you to talk about.
Once again, I have cut a worthless object.
He was not the sort of man to be slain according to another's will.
Suicide.
Even though in that short time, nothing had really changed,
ever say he wanted to be human again?
This time I intend
It is true that since regaining my true form
this is my last night as a vampire.
If there is a meeting,
Even if to Kiss-shot
Oh, dear servant.
this one decided to pay us a visit.

For that is how she acquires nutrients

I've been tricked into coming to the gymnasium storage room and now we're trapped!
Flashlight:
Well, when the new school term starts,
I'll be able to see lots and lots
of your gentle side, won't I?
So that's why...
You're amazing.
my fault.
It isn't your fault, Araragi.
that would've been a very mundane occurance.
wanted to become human...
Extinguishing this immortal body with my own hands
If you're that devoted to just anyone, you wouldn't have nearly enough lives to give.
But you're not just anyone.
Besides, if it's just to save one little Araragi,
So that's why...

Wouldn't you be able to stop her?
form, that is.
Araragi.
Do not hold back!
"Araragi, would you be so kind as to fondle my bra-less breasts".
I beg of you!
a very embarassing situation
You're right.
You ate someone.
No, that's not right.
But I averted my eyes to that fact.
So what I'm saying,
is that I pardoned your consumption of people.
I thought that you were perhaps that sort of person.
That's right. I understood.
You would have saved anyone, had they shown weakness.
As a parting gift for the underworld,
Ask away.
Kiss-shot,
Araragi, something isn't right!
Heart-Under-Blade,
So please...
I was planning on letting my guard down at an inauspicious juncture and forfeiting my life...
But this is fine.
For you have no other option other than to kill me, after all.
Kiss-shot!
Did something good happen?
I have no recollection of making a deal with you,
your choice of self-sacrifice
For the fee, let's see...
Now, what's the request?
and Heart-Under-Blade would be tied to you for the rest of her life.
Huh?
Well, if I consider myself as a human now,
Then why don't you just do as you please?
that skirts are totally unfit for hiding things you don't want seen.
If you'd excuse me.
you had a perfect score in all subjects, even PA and art, save for one single mistake.
Oh please, how do you remember that?
Stop that.
They say you shouldn't stay out alone at night.
So easy I feel like I said stuff that doesn't make much sense.
If I made friends, I'd lose my power level.
What?
I don't think I'm following.
If they got hurt, I'd be hurt too.
Friends are just another weakness.
Wanna come along?
Are...
I am Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade,
I can get away from this.
You refuse to help me?!
No! No! I don't wanna die!
I'll be smart, and everything bad that happens will be everyone else's fault.
It's been two days?
Hold on!
You are but a newborn as a vampire.
Why did you turn me into a vampire?
It is quite convenient for me.
There is something I need you to do.
Which is why you shall act in my stead.
Can I...
So? Can I?!
Fool.
they shall stand no chance against you.
Simply put: it is an easy task.
Hold on a second!
Heart-under-blade looked like she was in trouble, dragging your body around,
How did it go?
Introduce yourself.
Call me a mediator.
That makes her pretty famous actually.
Trying to convince those three is futile.
Boy, how do you plan to negotiate with them in the first place?
I'll level the playing field,
I have no idea how heavy a debt of 2 million is.
Do not worry.
i1Araragi.i0
Agreeable?
A vampire who kills its own kind
Hanekawa!
That's pretty perverted in its own special way.
A walk?
At this hour?
Well then, that's that. See you later.
Maths, you say?
That's Russian.
I only know what I know.
Good idea.
You shouldn't walk around
Even if I do think it's just a silly rumour,
I'm sorry! Did what I say strike a nerve?
I'm fed up with you.
And don't mess with my phone, either.
Dramaturgy!?
It is as it appears. I concede.
is quite a rare being.
Hey, Araragi,
I was pretty far away, so I might be mistaken,
I don't get you.
I'm pretty sure I told you not to.
I'm sorry I made you say those things.
I like being alone.
That's a lie.
I wouldn't mind making amends.
I'm so sorry I said all those horrible things!
really go back to being human again?
That's what she said, didn't she?
Don't act like you've seen through me.
What is?
If that were the case,
It's not like it's set in stone.
I guess it'll be fine to change my top.
Yeah, I'm getting there.
No different to a normal human.
No! Not at all! Nothing like that!
Well, even so, there's no reason to let disorder prevail.
so when I made my way here, I thought I'd better pick it up and bring it along.
So, what's all this then?
And what do you remember?
he acts out of personal feelings.
Then what about you?
No, it's nothing.
Her sides.
You sure are feisty, Araragi.
Why were you just watching?
It was a matter of payment.
I only received payment to mediate between those three.
Look around. This isn't a laughing matter, Oshino.
I am afraid not. Unfortunately, I can not yet use
any of my vampiric skills.
He is... How should I put it... A man of the cloth.
Close, yet far from the truth.
How's your gut wound, Hanekawa?
These ones have tomato in them.
Don't vampires consume blood as nourishment?
Hanekawa.
Before, I was of course moved by feelings of not wanting you to get involved,
I don't think I could return to humanity again if it meant neglecting you.
Frankly, it's creepy.
I don't mean it like that!
It's too much for me to bear.
It's about time I retire from my role as errand girl.
You can wait for me.
I almost fell for you.
You're hopeless.
It's not a matter of whether I want them or not!
You got that right!
Araragi,
And yet you still call yourself human?
And what exactly should I do
I'm getting outta here. Job's done.
Iyan.
you shall tell me the whereabouts of Heart.
I don't wakaru at all.
This is gokai! Gokai, I say!
don't dewalk.
Even if I do think it's just a silly rumour,
Nothing else matters to me.
DOTA
is almost unheard of.
I want to be Chikara! Best boy!
Dirt rawr! I actually wanted to go for a poke
Pok!
Understood.
Do I translate burousu as blouse?
So I found myself wondering,
in order to take ownership of it.
to Mary, what they stole was more than just blue on nyaa,
That's what the cartels says, isn't it?
They could just be obfuscating the truth in order to further their agenda-
You shouldn't doubt them like that.
Did something good happen?
"Speak of the devil and he doth appear."
If that were the case,
Sidelining the rumour talk for now, Hank, yesterday
Hoping to find UTW were you?
I suppose I was just trying to escape reality for a while.
Yeah, fuck funi.
Yeah, that'd do.
Ah, yeah...
Uh?
I would never sub anime, not in my wildest dreams!
You should close your aegisub.
If ya want my knowledge of stars
What's this?
Now I remember.
In contrast to Crunchyroll, rather than because it's a source of income,
Muraragi-kyun!
Feather River?
Gotta be honest with yourself, Tsundere.
That'll do, pig.
Hank...
Hank was!
Yeah. I saw.
Why was the moon waxing?
Then you should've said so from the start!
If you'd only told me...
If you want to Parrot all the comments off Nyaa's server, the Cartel'll need your soul.
Not a laughing matter; but a business matter.
I'll lift up a Hint.
My bad, Hank.
Let me stay like this...
Feels like Teen Spirit all up in my Toddy.
That so?
They are neither corporate shills like Crunchyroll,
Indeed.
They are.. how should I put it... Subbers of the Memes.
and Doki puts out fansubs to get donations to buy hentai,
So you don't crave this liquid goodness at all?
Now that Kizu is out, all we have are meme subs.
And it's all the Cartel's fault!
Bad English is not an "authentic" translation!
You just need a decent TL to express it in another language.
But it's spread throughout the weeb hivemind.
And they're so wrong.
Those aren't good translations at all!
Araragi!
But if it means I have to sit through all this liberal TL nonsense if I want a fansub,
But I firmly believe that good, flowing English
What mastery over the use of "hodo".
Please don't do that.
I have to go upload subs now
You bastard!
once we start?
Don't worry about anime!
If I can't see sub anime anymore, what's the point of knowing Japanese?
a bakemono.
I was basically Umaru from Himouto! Umaru-chan.
Ja, but, you wouldn't even tie my shoes for me, Jew servant.
I beat them all easily.
Were those guys weak? Or was I
I'm telling you, something's off!
You can be quite perceptive sometimes.
It wasn't Guillotinecutter who stole that heart.
You should have been forced to take the heart from me.
It's rare for an ordinary person to be entangled
It's okay to be happy.
Those who encounter an oddity once
Are you mad about the whole heart thing?
Didn't you want to talk about something?
You mentioned
Indeed, he was Japanese.
Do not move. I just cut you.
As well as something intolerable.
Intolerable, you say?!
and died.
In most cases, vampires seek death after 200 years of life.
In that short time, nothing changed for him.
Y Yeah.
So, are you prepared?
Could I go grab a bite to eat?
so it feels kinda bittersweet.
It wasn't bad at all.
What is this?
was chopped up
if she has another meal,
How do I deal with this?!
Let's say there's a naked woman in front of me.
If I never met you,
Please listen to me.
Episode,
You say that'd be selfish,
I don't want to run,
then I can at least atone for my sins.
What are you saying?
He won't do anything besides bring a balance.
There's no one left to stop that vampire.
Your expression has changed.
If there's something I can do, don't hesitate to ask.
I heard you!
It's extremely necessary.
You didn't see it.
What the complete Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade looks like.
so I can imagine what she's like at 27 years old...
So to prepare, I want some experience with female breasts.
Araragi-kun.
In a louder voice,
A Araragi-kun,
I grew these these slutty boobs...
There's no need to apologize.
Chicken.
Isn't it too soon for that kind of resolve?!
H How 'bout I just massage your shoulders instead?
Was that enough?
I came to understand the reason for your anger.
I refuse.
If you had known that,
I thought I would die for you.
care for me no longer.
Now! Come closer, servant.
Oh? Very well.
As a parting gift,
Ah?
Hold it!
What is it, servant?
It'd be meaningless unless he killed a complete you.
Do you believe this servant can kill me after you said that?
Or so I thought.
That's why...
What is this? Are you crying?
Blood. My blood is flowing.
starting tomorrow, I shall eat 1000 humans a day.
You ought to end the very life you saved.
And you shall be the last.
I'll pay up.
Your decision to make Araragi human again
As for the fee, let's see...
How 'bout the 5 million yen I considered paid?
but if that's fine, there is a way.
Heart-Under-Blade's one and only source of nutrition,
I shall die
Servant!
That's about it.
makes me feel like the world has changed.
You're late, Araragi-kun. I almost fell asleep.
We, who wounded each other,
Red when wet, black when dry.
Congrats, Araragi-kun.
You should be happy that you accomplished your goal.
I have a question, Oshino.
and from your point of view, they were too weak.
Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's servant.
but to stealthily steal even Kiss-Shot's heart
You're... capable of something like that?
You should have been forced to take the heart from me.
Sorry about what happened with Class Rep-chan.
It's rare for an ordinary person to be entangled
so deeply in a case like this.
In other words, now you can become human again.
Let me congratulate you one more time.
I mean, it's already been two weeks.
Well then, Araragi-kun.
Hey, don't talk like you're about to leave.
Anyways, what's done is done, what's over is over.
It may seem like I'm being generous,
Yyyyyahooooo!
Uh, Kiss-Shot? Sorry if this is a bad time,
Now, what shall we talk about?
I did not want to talk about something in particular. Anything is fine.
Uh Th That's...
A brilliant warrior worthy of entrusting my back to.
You said we're the same race?
Do not move. I just cut you.
Do you feel pain?
He was not a man who could be killed by others.
If there were anything different about that man,
has made me rather famished...
I shall prepare on the second floor.
While these two weeks have been a bad memory for Kiss-Shot...
Did you not bring that bespectacled, braided portable food?
Turns out they are a delicacy!
No
From now on, if Kiss-Shot eats another human,
in order to hurt her,
Ah! You're sitting there so you can see my panties.
You can't die.
It's not your fault.
Could it be?
Guillotinecutter...
Huh?
You're wrong.
Hanekawa...
Basically, if I'm only saving Araragi-kun,
I will...
It's extremely necessary.
tell me how you want me to do it.
So then,
Ah, I see.
So that's it!
was born solely to experience this day!
Araragi-kun. Am I really that unattractive?
Th Then, let's continue this next semester?
If you had known that,
That's not right.
Somehow, I perceived it from the start.
Now! Come closer, servant.
What are humans to you?
Shall I impart something good to you, servant?
there is no concept of "pure" or "subservient."
Does it matter?!
Nay, merely something I had long forgotten.
to eat humans at first!
So clamorous!
While I may be immobilized now due to blood loss,
Please tell me.
I began to question my actions.
No, these aren't tears...
Saying that will
Is that not your "responsibility"?
Stop fucking around and get your ass over here!
So get your ass over here,
Did something good happen?
Do something.
I want you to tell me a way to make everyone happy.
to starve to death with no nourishment.
In other words, we humans...
Must give up on hunting these dangerous vampires.
under such conditions!
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me now!
Your wish won't come true.
Well, my healing speed is pretty high.
I'm really...
now treat your master like a pet.
come and tell me, Araragi-kun.
I didn't realize it was out yet!
He's into models?
I'll follow Mr. Kurata anywhere.
But I'm sure he'll accomplish something great.
I heard a report of an attack by demon beasts on the road,
A robot?
That's right.
After you grow up, if you learn magic and swordsmanship.
Academy City Laihiala, near the capital of Kankkunen,
that would bring him one step closer to Silhouette Knights.
And so three years passed in the blink of an eye.
It's not easy to learn.
You need to start by training your magical power, or mana.
I guess I need to get out of that Magical Fundamentals class.
Haha! Come and get us!
Who do you think you are, carrying around a brand-new hammer?
That's right!
Just for daily life stuff.
I call it the Gunlike Rod.
Some of them seem to be show-offs, though.
If, during the mana measurement, I showed results that exceeded the contents of this course,
I'm extremely serious.
you have the same level of mana and knowledge as a middle school student.
What is that?
Piercing Lance...
That's the engine that forms the core of a Silhouette Knight.
you can't be the master of a Silhouette Knight!
That's why it's a national secret.
We're just a bunch of low-level blacksmiths.
And there have been no advancements since then.
were heading to a forest where relatively small demon beasts were supposed to live.
Sheesh.
You're a little strange, huh?
Sorry, Ernie.
But our mother isn't a noble,
Glad to hear it, partner.
At this point, it's totally different from the base Solodreah it started as.
I guess you could say that.
What?
A robot? What's that?
A large group of demon beasts appeared
and attacked the third-years during their night exercises.
Okay, you can go.
I brought help!
Something's not right.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Last time I was here, this place was like a festival every day.
Be quiet, Addy.
My companions are heading for her now.
Hey, don't cry.
Hey there!
You're the Princess of Kuschpercha, right?
Who are you?
It's okay!
That's right.
I'm not worthy of being protected.
Jeez.
Why are you being like that?
Princess, please give me my first mission as a knight.
Now let's get out of here.
they've been appearing in the east, so it's most likely they'll go there.
If it is,
to finally get to fight a worthy enemy!
They're after us already.
but a ship that flies with sails!
All the Tyrantos that were preparing for the drop have been wiped out!
It's flying...
We'll take this up again later.
That's impossible.
I'm so glad you're all right.
What is that?
Kuschpercha's scarecrows?
Good work!
I thought everybody but me would need some anti-air weapons.
This'll take a little time.
or if the enemy attacks first.
So I want your help.
It's me, Isadola.
Come in.
Let's go all out, Princess Eleonora.
Listen, get this ready by morning!
You feel a little better, right?
Why are you being kind to someone like me?
Hey, stop talking like that!
No, I don't even care if she's alive anymore.
I'll grant you a peerage and land in Kuschpercha when the job is done.
You're sure?
I'll never forget you!
You found the princess?
Wait.
...belong to me too, right?
Begin a full-out assault!
Have another!
Crush the rebels!
I can see it!
Batson!
Loading complete.
Blow engines 7 and 11 are damaged!
I'm looking forward to seeing your power!
but I'm getting a pretty good compensation package.
Who do you think I am?
and the commander of the armies!
Then...
You're willing to give me full rights to the design
Wait!
No, it's not a joke.
L-Leave the combat area!
that he got the Tzen's foot caught and clonked his head!
I understand your rage and sorrow.
The prince was slain by the demon?
The Kuschperchan army was able to retake Fontanie,
And the weight of a dwarven hammer.
brought the Western Grand Storm to a new stage.
What's that?
It's etherite.
The Tyranto is very heavy,
Splendid, isn't it?
Me, too.
Kid's blushing!
Perfect timing, Ernie.
This is, um...
so any Silhouette Knights you defeat with them
This fortress now belongs to the Reborn Kingdom of Kuschpercha!
The Kuschperchan knights are getting better.
No need to worry.
No! Run, everyone!
Oratio Gojass.
I'm surprised Zaloudek was making such a thing.
Addy, leave this to us.
Thank you!
But that's what makes you worth defeating!
Ankyurosa, shoot them down!
I caught you!
That was shocking.
Give it up!
The reactor suddenly deteriorates and shuts down.
Ankyurosa 2 has run out of mana!
Lord Gojass!
First, congratulations on the, uh... success?
How is it a success if we failed to avenge the prince?
What are you doing?
Once it starts to go out of control,
Just as knights speak with their swords,
But I lost my Swordman.
It's the best we have.
So the first fortress fell, huh?
You're not usually like this, Ernie.
So if our base goes down, we lose?
So offense doesn't work and neither does defense, huh?
You'll be left at home and in danger!
So we attack with all forces...
Before we lose the lives of any more knights, no, people,
We must not let that night of tragedies ever happen again.
Remove the invaders, and retake our capital!
Shilda Neryaku Fortress.
Misshire Javelins, fire!
Don't let a single enemy through!
What is that?
We managed to modify it into the Jilbaveil in time, huh?
This is when we have to put our best effort forth.
Let's do this!
I expected the battleship ever since I saw the airships.
And so, I'm sorry,
but in this battle today, I'm going to totally destroy that possibility!
Final Episode: "Heaven  Earth!"
Time for the counterattack!
Poor robots, your freedom stolen...
I shall put an end to this with my own hands!
I call it "maximize."
Oh? What's that?
Then we'll use this power against the demon!
Mission complete!
A shining dragon!
But a ship made by man can't grow in size!
In other words, that's a type of barrier!
It's just wearing the overflowing mana like a cloak!
then attack at point-blank range!
All they need is to work.
The battle is over already!
The battle is over!
but not victory!
The queen must not flee from the enemy.
He's heading for the main camp!
Queen Eleonora!
It's turning away!
But if Queen Eleonora's safe, I guess it's okay!
They collapsed in the face of the Kuschperchan assault
Get that stuff loaded!
I'm sorry, Ernie.
And how you saved Kuschpercha.
If Kid was a Silhouette Knight, I'd be rewriting his script!
After that, I'll go back to being a queen.
Bye!
Come back soon!
Seven more mountains, and we're back in Zaloudek!
Truly interesting.
I can't wait to find out.
Now then, where should I sell my technology next?
the best Knightsmiths,
Um, everyone...
Around me?
Jeez...
We're changing the specs?!
We have to do it, don't we?
My real job is as a programmer.
and they say one whole room's filled with plastic models.
The models I bought today,
Fremmevilla maintains its prosperity even when exposed to the threat of demon beasts
A robot?
can I pilot a Silhouette Knight?
So I was reborn into this world
Addy!
Um... I'm Ernesti.
No! You need to stay just the way you are!
The way I am...
What did you say?
Are you serious?
You're so slow!
Who do you think you are, carrying around a brand-new hammer?
I'll get it back.
What are you studying here?
Let's go, you two.
Yeah.
That lets us transform energy into magical phenomena.
It's combines the power of a sword to cut enemies with a gun that fires magic.
The students this year are quite talented.
would I be excused from Magical Fundamentals?
That's why I want you to make a calm, objective decision.
Very well.
It's weird.
Without understanding it,
Your group's already finished eating?
There isn't a student at the school who hasn't heard of you.
You're a little strange, huh?
a marquis named Joachim Selati.
but this one's been really customized.
My partner Dietrich is being annoying.
I figured you wouldn't be able to reach the stirrup.
and attacked the third-years during their night exercises.
First and second-years, leave your things and evacuate immediately.
Wasn't this supposed to be safe?
Archid! Adeltrud!
We'll handle the demon beasts!
But why are there so many demon beasts here?
Hurry!
My apologies to everybody else. You drew the short straw.
Steude!
Hey, there's no light!
No!
and head straight for the kingdom's capital!
What?
As soon as the first group's ready to go, we leave.
Don't push! Take turns!
I'll come straight out and ask.
Activating engine!
He stole a Silhouette Knight and went to attack it?
No way.
I'm sorry, D!
So this is a behemoth!
This is Silhouette Knight combat!
Here I come!
Almost its entire body is covered in a hard shell!
Even magic doesn't work!
Is it hard all the way through, maybe?
The most powerful magic a behemoth had was the enhancement magic that supported its huge frame.
Thank you!
How do you like that, monster?
Charge!
What's going on?
I wouldn't mind going down with my robot,
Do it if you don't want to die, okay?
What is he going to do?
And then, with the enhancement magic that supported it gone,
You died to save us.
I told you so! Ernie stole a Silhouette Knight!
Hey, Ernie, if you couldn't get inside that Silhouette Knight,
A child defeated a division-class demon beast?
It's a dangerous thing.
I am honored to meet you.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
There's a reason I've brought you here today.
I couldn't think of the proper way to reward you
How ridiculous!
It's beautiful.
Okay.
did the calculations myself,
Without his help, it would've been impossible!
No, I didn't do anything.
You're right.
It's likely that I'd destroy any that currently exists, yes.
We only swapped out 30 of the muscle and it worked great.
And compared to laying them out in a straight line,
Yeah, it's a mess, isn't it?
but we need your help.
It's simpler than I thought.
I'm making them because they don't exist!
Ernie!
is that it's far simpler and easier to make than a Silhouette Knight.
The new Crystal Tissue is safe,
You're the top knight,
Just goes to show they aren't just toys.
It's pretty accurate, huh?
Looking good!
but they're acting like it's a party.
by pitting the Trandorkis, now known as the Telestale, against the Earlcumber.
Both of you, bow!
I don't like to gamble,
but it would be no fun to just let you push me into a corner!
He crushed the sub-arm?
I won't let you keep doing this!
Cheers!
I bet!
So it's not complete, then?
had noticed.
Hey, what are you adding to our gears?
Okay, on to the next improvement!
It's an automatic-fire siege weapon!
Splitting the continent of Zetterlund in two is the Aubigne Mountains.
You've still got more to give?
Oh my... I think I might die of shock first.
but at least to the lab.
That's fine with me.
I hope they won't get mad at us.
Welcome!
Now! Charge!
But boss,
You wrote that it was an amazing new thing!
Welcome back!
He and the Telestale stayed behind with Marquis Dixgard.
How did you feel about the power of the new units?
Either way, the new units will be of great benefit to the nation.
How's school?
I want to hear what you have to say...
I've been given full authority over the new unit.
and then request access to Ether Reactor technology, a national secret!
Another?
The best, you say?
It's Ernie we're talking about.
I'll go and talk to him!
Do you realize how long that'll take on foot?
This is a different matter.
You mean the Guair?
Which means we need to send the new unit to Fort Casadesus.
Thanks, boss!
Several days later,
Red, just like I thought.
They don't suspect a thing.
Let's make it a good one.
T-Type identified! It's a behemoth!
My apologies to everybody else. You drew the short straw.
Kuchl!
Get the wounded loaded into the carriages first!
The students from Laihiala are having a training exercise in Cloquet Forest right now!
Gather up all the surrounding Knight Runners in the vicinity.
Hurry, but don't panic!
Helvi, help me!
Edgar, do you know what you're saying?
All units, draw your rods!
Dietrich, where are you going?
Go on without me!
One more person there wouldn't have changed a thing!
Now then, time to show what I can do as a programmer!
Identifying similar spells.
Feeding back movement disparities.
Then it's time to apply the first lesson of destroying huge weapons!
creatures who possessed catalyst crystals
So this is going to be a battle of attrition, huh?
Over there!
Use that weapon!
I tried to conserve as much mana as I could,
...is another robot!
Air Bullet!
Checkmate.
The lightning fired directly into the behemoth's eye traveled along its optic nerve
I thought you ran away, but I was wrong.
Lauri's grandson, perhaps?
but it's at least as maneuverable as the original Guair.
It's not all bad.
they began to repair damage to the village.
The extra Silhouette Knights will just get in our way.
It's just as the rat said.
It seems that in addition to the Kaldatoah, the enemy has seized several Telestales.
Don't do anything stupid!
Get the Haimerwort out there!
Edgar and the others going to Fort Casadesus encountered Kerhilt's gang as they fled.
We are from the Laihiala Academy of Knight Runners!
I'll smack anyone who whines about it!
That's not how you use the back weapons!
You won't get away!
Well done!
Hey, what are you doing?
Turn back!
And you really think you'll be okay by yourself?
Maybe I should just fly in there myself.
We ran into a weird Telestale on the way here!
Yeah! They just opened fire on us!
Edgar and Dietrich are fighting them!
I'm sorry, Knight Commander Fredholm.
Very well then, Ernesti Echevalier.
They're so fast!
No!
Kid!
Yeah.
so I'll end it here!
The Earlcumber!
Edgar!
Let's run!
I'll handle them!
I swore I'd never abandon my pride as a knight again!
I see!
Students!
was annihilated by dawn, thanks to the efforts of Ernesti and the others.
I know.
I won't let them have your partner.
Next time: "Trial and Error."
I know what this is.
I can't move.
You're so warm, Ernie.
That tickles!
and the arm-like things on its back...
It's been a century since we've had anything like this.
I'm very busy today, so I'll be going.
Oh dear.
That stupid brat!
But I'll show him!
I see. So he's back at Laihiala.
That's not true!
What's going on here?
It's got a miniaturized Magius Engine in it,
This really is hard!
To whom?
Isn't this...
Option Works?
For example, a flexible coat.
Yes.
I couldn't reach it in my dreams,
drastically speeding up the work of the Order of the Silver Phoenix.
I've dealt with all the suspicious persons in the school.
Maybe they were having fun?
Maybe Ernie likes cool women like that?
I want to pilot a Silhouette Knight, too!
But there's something I want some help with first.
You three, observe and take measurements!
I'm done thinking about what happened.
Let's experiment more later, after some improvements.
Nothing good happens when I give the kid some time off.
That's why you chose Kid and Addy?
The size of the machine and the mana it burns are on a whole different level.
This feels good!
It's fine.
And there were only three days left until the date given by King Ambrosius.
Looks like we got it done, silver kid.
Order of the Silver Phoenix, we're off to the capital!
The ones who, by my order, formed a new knightly order!
Next time: "New  Old!"
at the Capital City of Kankkunen.
Damn that brat!
The Silhouette Knight is shaped like a horse and rider.
but this will be fun.
There are three of us and one of it!
We'll handle it just like a demon beast!
Wow!
But Ernesti himself seems to have stopped.
I guess they won't be easy to beat!
It must take a lot of your focus to take on a mech that's like a bucking bronco.
while the Silver Phoenix's are diamonds in the rough.
What?
I'm out of mana!
Everyone, don't forget about me, okay?
No, it wasn't the machine's fault I lost.
Humility is a virtue,
He looks like a lab Knightsmith.
That's a great question!
Actually, it includes two Ether Reactors.
Two?
The Kaldatoah Darsch was wonderful!
Come on, it's time to talk to the king!
further enhancing its fighting power!
Sorry, I didn't get that at all.
Laihiala Knight Runners Academy, thank you for everything!
Now, Ernesti, I have a request of you...
I may be retired,
And also power!
A muscle-brain?
I knew they were muscle-brains.
He was probably a first class Knight Runner, too.
Once our unit was attacked by a huge mass of Demon Beasts.
You're mine!
Not yet!
The Golden Lion is yours!
It looks hot in there...
Shellcased...
Rarely, multiple queens can exist within one horde.
If we can buy time,
The Order of the Silver Phoenix?
The new unit's name, Guairlinde, isn't just for show!
They look totally different than they did during the mock battle.
This has turned the tide of the battle.
Now, if we can only defeat the queen,
Don't be stupid, Kid!
What was that for?
Look!
even a queen!
What's wrong with that?
If you'd been in these new units,
you could've fought the same way.
No matter how you try,
Every last thing!
and filled with the blood of living things.
So an ancient sage used what is now known as alchemy
We call this the "Life Song."
It's hard, isn't it?
which let us use magic.
The size of the catalyst crystal
Very well.
Thank you so much!
Ambrosius told the Order of the Silver Phoenix, but...
Ernie learned.
you are one of the Changing Ones, and yet you know different laws than they do.
and at last began to work on his dream of his own Silhouette Knight.
Do you know where Ernie is?
Does that have something to do with those raiders?
Ernie!
The Silver Nerves are connected!
and large reactor "Behemoth's Heart," both activated.
Ikaruga!
I am thrilled to witness this moment with you.
The "Federation" is just a collection of tiny nations.
We must quickly enhance the defenses of Shild Trider!
Shild Trider is impenetrable.
What is this firepower?
But the war took an unexpected turn.
Indeed.
What?
Figurehead! Reverse blow engines!
No!
Eleonora?
If that hurt,
then you're still alive!
By dawn, both the King of Kuschpercha and Delvancul had fallen.
Once we're over the river, we're in the Duchy's territory.
They buzz above our heads,
but it's useless.
How dare you!
Is something wrong, young master?
What kind of merchant uses a monstrous carriage like that?
Yeah.
His sub-arms are overpowering my Tyranto?
Ernie goes out, and the next thing I know, it's over.
so it's no exaggeration to say that this is ours.
you're not calling off the wedding?
I think I can help him.
Thanks to reports from Nora of the Order of the Azure Hawk,
Just as Ernesti was having his meeting,
Open fire first!
What's with all the swords?!
you're very wrong!
If we have to fight those,
we're going to need Ernesti to come up with an effective weapon.
Ernie!
Aldirat, show me your power!
Young master,
That's right.
Right!
But rescuing the princess is the priority.
Hey, what was that sound?!
I've come to save you.
Please, leave.
Right?
And you can from now on!
If everyone suffers because of me...
I will be your knight and protect you.
they've been appearing in the east, so it's most likely they'll go there.
If it is,
The next day, Doloteo Mardonnes's Levitate Ship found the Order of the Silver Phoenix
created a way to fly!
We're leaving!
Something so insane... and it's flying!
These two geniuses would be at the core of
Why did you even bother coming back?!
The demon beast guards?
You're such a wimp.
Knight, what is this?
The Lesvant, the Kuschperchan Silhouette Knight,
Knight.
The Silhouette Knights that the Silver Phoenix destroys and captures.
But does your Ikaruga really need it?
I thought everybody but me would need some anti-air weapons.
That is what it means to have royal blood.
Do you think I'd know how a princess feels?
I'm going to hit you.
You two sure are close.
If she was a Silhouette Knight,
What about you, Kid?
Hey, how have you been... Your Highness?
You've come to persuade me to take the throne as well?
P-Princess?
You feel a little better, right?
Great.
Hey, stop talking like that!
Because you're you, of course.
I want you to take the princess back from a group calling themselves that.
I'll grant you a peerage and land in Kuschpercha when the job is done.
That's what you want, right?
Yes, ma'am!
I'll be using the Vendobadahla Custom.
It won't work?
I can't just turn tail and run!
You've learned, huh?
It's time for bed!
This is for the Trandorkis!
What we want to hear most right now is, "Thanks."
passed through Fontanie, the land of the former Duke Fernando,
It's dangerous to be near the windows.
This ship is escorting Prince Cristobal.
I came here to see you.
Fire!
Stay close to the flagship!
Truly fascinating.
If we can't get out of range of those spears, we're doomed!
I won't let you take another step!
The Golden Silhouette Knight!
Demon Knight Runner, join me.
Um...
Demon... I'll make you pay for this in hell!
Flying by using explosions?
I wonder what type of person, exactly, made such a thing.
I'm back.
Sir Knight?
The death of their commander, Cristobal,
The Kuschperchan army was able to retake Fontanie,
Glory to Kuschpercha!
Eleonora...
I see.
The Tyranto is very heavy,
I think it's only used during emergencies like wartime.
It makes me jealous sometimes.
No, just eat it like this.
H-Hey there...
then we'll give some to you.
Beyond that,
That's perfectly fine.
Just kidding! Just kidding!
This is the sweat of the heart.
This fortress now belongs to the Reborn Kingdom of Kuschpercha!
That's a good thing, though.
you can learn about mine too,
What?!
You think you'll get close?
I see.
I see! A powerful foe!
I'm not done yet!
He dodged?
Misshire Javelin, fire!
Wh-What the?!
Lightning Flail!
It may not be destroyed,
the demon will lose its wings.
If it will help me defeat the demon, then I will master it.
it's a loss to my army not to use a knight like you.
It's the best we have.
but they're likely to strengthen their weapons next time.
Then we can strengthen our defenses.
what is there to be afraid of?
If the enemy wishes to avoid a confrontation with Ernesti,
We must not let that night of tragedies ever happen again.
The drake!
but we're the engines, so we can't move.
I expected the battleship ever since I saw the airships.
Let's find out, Oratio Gojass.
Now, let's begin our party!
Burn them down!
The power that exceeds even the demon's...
I call it "maximize."
Okay, I saw one of the drawbridges come down.
Well done, Commander Cunitz.
Mission complete!
Every weapons designer wants more destructive power.
But it's inelegant to try and get it by growing massive!
A Levitate Ship...
toys will be helpless as they're destroyed!
The battle is over!
Howling!
Don't die, Kid!
The capital, Delvancul, had used all of its forces to defend the fort,
And thus Eleonora became both the de facto and de jure Queen of Kuschpercha.
Sheesh...
I got a great present, too!
No...
B-Bye!
No, that was plenty.
Especially you Knight Runners.
the best Knightsmiths,
It'll be sunset before that silver-haired boy is done talking about his dreams.
Agreed.
I'm hungry.
There's a reason I've brought you here today.
Child or no, I cannot fail to reward someone who defeats a behemoth.
I want to make my very own Silhouette Knight, with my own hands!
It seems you're all doing well.
I want to be the first to tell His Majesty.
It was wonderful!
Let's sing the praises of the Guair!
You're right.
you'll destroy any Silhouette Knight that exists?
In other words,
But for an experienced Knight Runner, that's a simple matter.
That's part of the reason we're capable of operating them.
It's simpler than I thought.
is that it's far simpler and easier to make than a Silhouette Knight.
and have the middle school students help.
All Ernie will look at is big, hard, cold things!
After much research, failure, and improvements,
Okay, try walking.
I didn't realize you could use Silhouette Gears like that.
Deploying Silhouette Arms.
That's Edgar for you.
A normal pilot would've lost during that first charge.
Helvi's pushing really hard, isn't she?
She's out of mana!
This is amazing, right?
So it's not complete, then?
a tiny thorn had already embedded itself in the Laihiala Academy of Knight Runners.
Next Time: "Light  Shadow!"
Unless this problem was fixed, it couldn't be used in actual combat.
and so more mana expended.
It doesn't have to be muscle, right?
Kid, Addy, are you ready?
Okay, on to the next improvement!
He wasn't planning on using them for anything, huh?
Splitting the continent of Zetterlund in two is the Aubigne Mountains.
That's what it's going to take to shock the king.
This is for Marquis Dixgard.
Is this all the students involved in the creation of the new Silhouette Knight?
That's impossible!
It must be the biggest one around here, huh?
Why are you so calm?
You take care of him, please!
But boss,
Don't ask me.
They're here!
"He made something super-amazing," huh?
Stephania?
This concludes my explanation of the new unit
Honor. Position. Rewards.
Your future!
What do you intend to do now?
Don't make it sound so simple!
It is only possible with huge amounts of personnel and time!
There's more?
All right, moving on...
Shaggy-head?
Ernesti is there at the official invitation of the marquis.
It?
I see.
That's just fine.
Red, just like I thought.
Let's make it a good one.
Dietrich, how do you like the reborn Guair?
It's a serious disappointment to think that I have to
hand something like this over to Dixgard.
It's not all bad.
Why me?
Welcome back!
Boss, there they are!
Don't do anything stupid!
We don't need to stay here.
So this is the power of the new unit?
I never thought I'd find out for myself in real battle.
Shut up, kid.
Where are you going, boss?
Hey, what are you doing?
What the hell happened here?
We ran into a weird Telestale on the way here!
I see.
He's... just screwing with me!
Then that means I can't run, either!
The Earlcumber!
The Telestale can't have gone far!
Edgar!
What are they doing here?
There's just too many!
I don't know!
I see!
Students!
That's a forbidden concoction that drives demon beasts into a frenzy!
more work must be done, and better secrecy must be maintained.
Ernesti Echevalier, you will command it,
and lead them all.
The one that I fought at the end,
The Earlcumber and I will get it back.
I dozed off and Addy grabbed me,
You're so warm, Ernie.
Meanwhile, the Telestale was sent to the nation's greatest research lab,
They're different from anything we've ever seen.
If I can use that new unit as the base for a new mass-produced model,
I'm now the commander of the newly-created Order of the Silver Phoenix.
But I'll still continue to be a student until graduation.
It should be fun to follow our commander.
so can you and the rest of the Knightsmiths, boss!
I'll make sure to be useful to you then.
You sure look happy, though!
His Majesty has given us a greater goal of making the best machine possible,
A battle with the lab?
We're just making one new unit?
There're lots more!
Yes.
But I'll come any time I get the chance, okay?
So never change!
So you're...
so we'll leave this to you.
Understood.
Maybe Ernie likes cool women like that?
I see the issues.
Let's experiment more later, after some improvements.
We can re-examine the scale and output power of the spells,
Not only did you destroy a valuable Kaldatoah,
What the hell were you thinking?
Ernie's so cute when he's sad!
Huh?
So the new one's a two-seater?
they need to be able to work in harmony.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Ernie, I'm sorry.
The size of the machine and the mana it burns are on a whole different level.
It's fine.
Edgar, can I have a word?
so power output compared to the original model is...
improving defense and solving the mana pool drain issues!
We've added two Silhouette Arms as a back weapon,
Splendid.
And now, everyone,
Is that a Silhouette Knight?
two Telestale derivatives equipped with Option Works,
The Order of the Silver Phoenix is here, in answer to your majesty's orders!
The Silhouette Knight is shaped like a horse and rider.
What a genius!
Here they come! Platoon two, you take the rider!
...is flying?
Here we go, Tzen!
I don't know what kind of trick he used,
It must take a lot of your focus to take on a mech that's like a bucking bronco.
Philia, it's coming!
I know!
Who's that?
How is that knight-and-rider working?
That's a great question!
The Toybox's high-maneuverability structure is called a Magius Jet Thruster.
They really love their Silhouette Knights...
but far too unpolished.
Come on, it's time to talk to the king!
Crown Prince Leotamus
Laihiala Knight Runners Academy, thank you for everything!
I'm honored to meet you, Prince Emrys.
I may be retired,
And so I thought I'd have you make me one.
I want something that looks super-strong,
Will that work?
Understood!
I'll prepare something worthy of the prince and former king!
As you requested, they're both very powerful,
A golden lion and a silver tiger!
Let's have a match, Grandpa.
His skill with the spear is incredible, huh?
I heard that prince Emrys looks just like the former king when he was his age.
Prince, I'll open a way through!
At least you can make it out!
What are you talking about?
No matter where we look, the enemy's right in front of us!
Victory lies within the blade!
Ernesti.
Was this his plan?
Understood.
Next Time: "Secret  Quest!"
On that day, there was an announcement at Schreiber Castle
Shellcased...
Allen! Tod!
I'll handle this!
Earnes and the others are at the fort.
Don't think you can break through the shield of Earldilandecumber!
Let's give up on the legs!
This speed was unanticipated.
I'm going to go take a better look at the queen's face.
I won't let anyone interfere with my ambitions,
No, the Order of the Silver Phoenix wins!
What's wrong with that?
If you'd been in these new units,
There are those of us who become ambassadors
try it all,
For the first hundred years of our lives,
I am grateful.
He would.
I'm Ernesti Echevalier!
Don't decide that so quickly.
Very well.
In accordance with the laws, I shall grant your request.
I thought catalyst crystals changed mana into magical power.
and transforms into something soft like clay.
while using multiple types of magic to refine the mythril.
we use catalyst crystals that were mined,
which may be less powerful, but are more stable.
Your Former Highness, I know just the Demon Beast that qualifies...
Ernie!
Welcome back!
And so Ernesti returned to Fort Orobesius,
Wait!
These western lands were once ruled as one nation, by one king!
And our nation is its rightful heir!
In other words,
My servants told me a war might be starting.
There's no need to worry, Eleonora.
Black ships, coming from the sky!
Fight hard, everyone!
Figurehead! Reverse blow engines!
It's time to win some glory.
I am so proud to be your father.
Even if it costs my life.
I request a one-on-one duel!
If that hurt,
Splendidly done, Prince of Zaloudek.
You win!
Kuschpercha has fallen.
They buzz above our heads,
but it's useless.
We're searching you and your cargo!
An iron gate destroyed in a single strike?
A long-range battle!
You're talking about Silhouette Knights, right?
Yes, unforgivable!
Zaloudek's army started to speak of a monstrous horse and rider,
We find it.
Ernesti found out about Princess Eleonora's plight.
But no matter what your armor is, it can't match a behemoth!
This is my time to shine!
You'll pay for that!
We'll try this later.
Couldn't say.
Eh...
Mozuku.
Mozuku.
We came of visit.
Nothing to complain?
And why still...?
I always think...
For example...
Hey, what happens?
A new being, take possession of your body and your brain handles.
Kunato...
Until recently the government called him all the time.
It is true.
I will return as soon as possible.
Can not be by phone?
I leave it.
Yeah...
I desist...
Yeah.
We now have plenty of ammunition to defeat Gauna.
Do not push yourself, I will not forgive you if to screw up the Tsugumori-kai.
Yeah...
I did not think they work so fast in something.
I think one option is to shoot all the same point.
My name is Shiraui Tsumugi.
This is Colony 2!
What are you doing there?
The city's been around for a thousand years.
What? What happened to Hiroki Saito?
The Gauna.
She didn't have to talk to us like that.
Yeah...
Once we've reached the end of our life span, all we have left is to go to the organic converter reactor, huh?
Sidonia is being controlled by the Immortal Council.
Nagate Tanikaze, there's someone who wishes to become your personal guarantor.
I'm here on their behalf.
You're Nagate Tanikaze, correct?
Never mind that, your clothes really stink.
Hello, everybody.
Huh?
Whether I'm a boy or girl.
What?
Hey, look.
I'm not-
Like this?
MY Tsugumori?
It's a waste to give this unit to a rookie like you.
Y-yes, ma'am!
Tanikaze!
Heavy damage to Yamano.
We might engage in a clutch formation together, so let's shake hands to be safe.
It'll go in on its own, but don't take it out. Or else, you'll hurt yourself.
Wait, this is Tanikaze's first time.
Hooray!
No! No!
En!
They don't have a Kabizashi in their possession.
Have the cadets fall back.
Don't let it provoke you.
A Gauna Cluster has entered our high security sector.
Hey, Shinatose.
I'll see you later.
It seems you need to start with the safety belt basics.
The newbie piloted the Tsugumori?
Uh... yeah.
Are you okay, Nagate?
What's that?
Yeah.
So it's looking to come back.
It's Norio Kunato who is at the top of his 628th cadet class.
I'm going to get a doctor.
I haven't been able to keep any of my food down.
Really?
What's up with her?
They came here to see you.
Are they checking out the competition?
Whatever!
Hey!
Our time isn't up, okay? Not yet!
Knights of Sidonia
Display acceleration level.
Attention citizens.
Gauna 542 is closing in.
Even if we diagonally accelerate at maximum capacity,
We're going to use an Inter-Planetary missile!
Equip all dispatching Gardes with them.
Wow, I didn't know we had so many of those prototype weapons finished.
Roger!
Garde clutch formation: condition good. No issues with current trajectory.
Central Command to Garde squads.
We need another hero to save us.
...a Knight of Sidonia!
But we haven't trained with it yet.
You will act as a decoy.
Squad one, drop down to the surface and dodge the Heigus cannon fire.
561, you still have your gun-barrel extension attached!
And we can still use the Heigus particle cannons.
We're almost there!
Crimson Hawkmoth.
They're all gone?
As long as the Crimson Hawkmoth is there, there's no hope to destroy each Gauna.
What?
We copy. We will destroy the host core!
and we will perform an emergency shutdown of the gravity generator.
Master Norio!
Home.
All units, enter orbital trajectory!
Knights of Sidonia
Tanikaze!
Gauna 542 is accelerating 2 percent every minute. Adjusting its projected trajectory.
Approximately 20 minutes until it reaches the point of no return.
Heigus concentration rising in the front.
Leave me!
No use.
Come on, hit!
Damn it.
Gauna 542 disintegration confirmed.
IPM contact status?
They will!
The threat has been eliminated.
I just did pretty much what anyone else would've done.
Yeah, well, actually, I always blamed you for that thing that happened to En.
It was a perilous task from which 38 of the 48 Garde units would not return.
Is that true?
It was hard.
I really do love all the people living here in Sidonia.
The truth is that they're really so important to me.
You took both my Garde unit and my glory.
Tanikaze's frame, moderate damage!
It's a Gauna!
q2Supposedly, if you fly in formation with someone you've never had physical contact with, bad things will happen.
No, thank you.
She's always like that.
That could be bad.
En!
They can't hold!
He's in cardiopulmonary arrest!
Gauna successfully repelled!
Who can tell me when mankind started to photosynthetize?
Do you know why?
Tanikaze!
There!
Put a swift end to it!
You can't destroy the core without a Kabizashi!
It's okay.
You witnessed the Gauna doing these horrible things.
Must've been pretty traumatic.
Neither where they come from nor why they are attacking us.
It is rebuilding its placenta.
The speed at which it's traveling away from us is decreasing.
I think it's fine, but they told me not to take the cast off.
That information was not made public.
Allow me introduce them.
Right.
Sorry. I must stink.
You'll be the youngest champion in history!
It's a Gauna!
Yamano's armor is failing!
Preparing heavy quantum cannon!
Brain activity recovered!
30 seconds until HQC projectile impact!
That's enough, Tanikaze!
That hive cluster is within three light years of Sidonia.
Do not take up arms!
The Gauna are threatening us.
As soon as he joined, we encountered a Gauna.
Sorry, we're in a hurry.
About one hundred years ago.
This allows us to only have to eat once a week.
Put a swift end to it!
You don't remember?
q2Tsugumori's pilot managed to kill them by retrieving the abandoned Kabizashi, winning the war.
These four are Sidonia's finest Gardes pilots.the best Gardes pilots Sidonia has to offer.
I've just been throwing up anything I eat right back up recently.
Did you call me?
Right.
You don't.
I should invite Nagate.
You'll be the youngest champion in history!
Can we have a moment?
Tanikaze used his high speed pulseblade and 30 of his rapid fire ammo.
The Gravity Festival?
Oh, right.
Yes.
Let us find out who is most worthy of wielding a Kabizashi!
What?
How may I help you?
Sorry, Tanikaze.
O-Okay.
That footage isn't available to students!
Glad to hear it.
Who wrote it?
She possesses outstanding insight and a strategic mind capable of replacing me.
Send me Midorikawa Yuhata's proposal to read.
Are you okay?!
Nagate!
Neither of you are badly injured.
I'm sorry.
Oh, right!
Let's check who won!
His winning streak continues.
I'm not surprised Akai-san and the others won!
The water reservoir comprises one fourth of Sidonia.
Welcome to the reservoir.
I didn't know this place existed.
Give them some time alone.
He said meeting you really helped with the nervousness.
You may be able to fight Gauna, but not an empty stomach.
Quad formation!
Suppress the placenta's regen.
Link to Akai frame severed.
Ready the Heavy Mass Driver.
Roger.
Midorikawa, expose the core for me.
With its propulsion system, it will take it about three days to reach Sidonia.
Hey, are you okay?!
Huh? Isn't today food day?
Strike!
Winner: Aoki!
i1Tanikaze Nagate was able to go toe to toe with a Gauna in it and survive.
Start!
Midorikawa Yuhata!
I'm Akai Mochikuni.
My stomach's growling.
Not too shabby.
announcerThirty seconds left on the clock!
It's over!TLCI've watched over 20 animes and it sounds good to me
I see.
Glad to hear it.
Replacing you?
It has changed course and is heading straight towards Sidonia.
Send me Midorikawa Yuhata's proposal to read.
The sea!
You can come too.
Wait, really?
Normally it's open only to full-fledged pilots.
It's so wonderful!
I was joking earlier.
Quad formation!
All frames, fire at will.
Roger!
Good!
What?!
You bastard!
Listen to us, Momose!
Shit!
Momose!
Deflection failure.
An... uneven acceleration?
Affix your safety harness to a railing at once and brace for acceleration.
I repeat.
I got this!
Check your safety harness.
It's not enough.
Still?
No change in G487's trajectory.
We're working on it.
Equip defense squads with eight Kabizashis.
The retrieval squad consists of Kunato Norio, Hoshijiro Shizuka,
Launching defense squads sequentially.
I hope all this ends soon.
Wow, there are so many Gardes.
What will happen to us?
Where is the Gauna?
Prepare to return.
G487 is doing something new.
Shit.
Not even the com is working.
G487 has lost much of its placenta!
Was he going for a Hyggs interference explosion?
Tanikaze is unhurt.
G487 has been defeated by Tanikaze.
G487 has been defeated by Tanikaze.
Yes, I am.
He's about to cross the line of no return.
I know.
Tanikaze has crossed the line of no return.
q2Akai-kun!
Listen to us, Momose!
I repeat.
Who cares?!
Switch to inertial cruise!
What's going on?
Any questions?
Looks like you're hungry, so let's continue our discussion another time.
Speed it up.
Get cracking.
Defense squads are fully deployed.
Retrieval squad, report.
The response from the Kabizashi response is getting weaker again.
Tanikaze, rendezvous with Honoka and Hoshijiro.
I have found the Kabizashi.
Commander!
En!
Relaying video.
Hyggs engine critical on Hoshijiro's frame.
Hoshijiro frame lost!
Gauna is now less than 2000km away.
Hyggs reaction inside Gauna.
Come back, Tanikaze!
Gauna is now less than 2000km away.
Please be careful.
Yeah.
You must have taken to the Gardes quickly.
It has been seven days since the uneven acceleration disaster.
Please do pay attention during lecture.
That's right.
q2Isn't it obvious Hiroki took that kid and hid underground because he got sick of how things were up here?
Tanikaze-kun?
Right!
256 frames on reverse thrust.
Cut the chatter, frame 007.
G487 has lost much of its placenta!
All frames are to return.
Yeah.
On the off chance.
Sorry!
He told me to do whatever needs to be done to survive.
I think I forgot.
It is believed to have been built by an alien civilization.
Sometimes I wonder where the hive clusters come from,
We didn't really learn anything since our first encounter with them.
That was the first time it appeared like that in almost two hundred years after the first contact.
How?
They... do.
Salute.
Let's go.
Are these Gardes?
q2we have 256 Gardes returning in formation with two trainees and the frame which sheltered them for eleven days.
I'm deeply moved by the sight.
Roger.
Recovery from fatigue is slowed by 1.5.
The stench has been growing, though.
Surely you understand, Kobayashi.
It is likely that Sidonia has entered a region of strong Gauna presence.
Are you mocking us, Kobayashi?
It's been ages since I ate some decent food.
Yeah. I agree.
Makes me proud I know him.
Congratulations, Tanikaze-kun.
Why don't we get in formation now?
Here's something we can be proud of.
What do you do exactly?kouhai lol
wanted to thank you for avenging my brother.
be like the knights of Sidonia
Are you okay?
You were running after the captain.
I wasn't able to go last time.
i1Ouch.
Of course I am.
Pilots can only bring one person with them.
Have you ever eaten goosefish stew, Tanikaze-san?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
The door will now open.
No. Leave it like this.
Looks like we got separated from the others again.
It must have discovered us before we did and approached invisibly.
They say life emerged from the sea.
East Two launch pad. West Four launch pad.
I'm fine.
Hello.
No way!
They've come for us!
One might see this asCould this be the second coming of the knights of Sidonia?
No, we wouldn't have lasted much longer.
Welcome back.
Rice?lol
Did you lose weight? Shouldn't you be resting?
The stench has been growing, though.
then he will eventually part ways with you.
Are you mocking us, Kobayashi?
Glad to have you back.
Wow!
The curtain has risen on our war with the Gauna.
to tell who's who.
Got some time?
What do you do exactly?kouhai lol
q2Sauce?
Because he worried about you.
Right now?
We will be launching into the water shortly.
Roger!
Or, well, it did on Earth.
Izana.
Hello.
I'm not satisfied.
Knights of Sidonia
1,000 kilometers until subjugation squad reaches target.
Roger.
Samari!
Is Kunato's squad making progress on the tail?
Tanikaze, four charges!
Detonation confirmed.
Aborting mission.
All frames, retreat.
Leave him!
I don't agree.
Tanikaze, what are you doing?
Letting him pilot the renowned Tsugumori may have backfired.
That includes sortieing.this looks weird but is apparently correct
Someone needs to talk some sense into him.
Furthermore, the former executive officer, Seii Ichirou, is joining the pilot squads.
Let's go, Nagate!
So, what are the protesters planning?
But I will not stop the war.
Begin preparations at once.
Yeah, I heard.
Thanks!
Captain's orders.
Roger.
A-1-5 and B-4-3, nothing.
S-4-1, nothing.
Is that wound on your head really okay?
We don't want to make Hiyama-san worry.
Tanikaze Nagate speaking.
Launch them immediately.
Image analysis complete.
I'm putting it on the main screen.
The enemy this time may be large, but we have experience fighting the Gauna.
Shit!
Is Kunato's squad making progress on the tail?
Kunato, hurry and sever it!
What are you doing, Tanikaze?!
Kunato didn't give the signal yet!
The Gauna's attention is on its tail!
Roger!
Gauna is reacting to the detonation.
It wasn't Tanikaze's fault alone that the tail was not severed.line needs changing for batch
You killed Hoshijiro.
I'll give it a shot tomorrow.
the military leadership has announced a bold change in personnel.
Okay.
So, what are the protesters planning?
A large demonstration is being planned, and more and more wish to depart Sidonia.
Call Yure.
Calling it a great victory is a joke.
But I'm not a girl.
I can't stop eating!
Put rogue planet N 68203L on the screen.
Destroy the planet.
Objections?
Open.
All personnel, brace for launch.
Rogue planet N 68203L targeted.
Good.
Good.
Distance to planet: 3,000 kilometers.
No, three!
The gas is so thick.
Sortie?ts
I'll be back, Izana.
Nakazono's squad, board your frames.
Processing image.
Undead.
Knights of Sidonia
No, three!
OP
Nakazono's takes G490.
All frames, disperse.
Formation 122A.
Look at that stuff trailing from G491!
We're pursuing G489 in a line formation.
They want us to harvest it while its still mobile?
Thank you!
Samari's squad has finally engaged the target!
Nakazono squad, frame 312, severe damage!
Samari!
Resuming combat!
Kunato's squad will make contact with G490 soon.
Where is it?
Just like Saitou.
Welcome back, Hiyama-san.
Sidonia won't recover.
392 survivors among the population.
i1It was almost as if she had swapped with Hiroki.
Kobayashi!
He was found collapsed in front of the biothermal reactor.
His aging advanced while he forewent medication.
He fought for so long.
We won't be able to put him back in!
Careful!
Hiro?
Izana suggested this might cheer you up.
Image analysis complete.
What?
OP
Don't think anything of it!
Samari's squad takes G489.
Message from the EBD.exobiology division, change typeset if you change it
Ludicrous!
Thank you!
Roger.
All frames, fire in unison!
Kunato is abandoning the frontline!
If we pursue it, we won't have the resources to engage.
Roger.
q2Recall six hundred years ago, when we swore to serve Sidonia on the Immortal Council with our experience and sagacity
I remember that we swore we would see this seed ship fulfill its purpose.
i1What an ominous feeling.
i1I can feel that many will disappear.
Artificial gravity has recovered to almost 1G.
A mere two Gauna made it into Sidonia.
25 survivors on the council.
You ordered us to take him alive, Kobayashi!
Most of the knowledge of the past and its technology is gone forever!
Shinatose Yure.
Kobayashi!
It's too early!
How long until we can get inside?
You can't take him directly from the amniotic tank!
I need fifteen years... no, ten!
Huh?
Damage from annihilation is rapidly reversing.
You better not slack off, Akai.
Pilots Tsuruuchi and Aoki, your match will begin in ten minutes.
Point! Aoki wins.
How do you do? I'm Yuhata.
Yuhata Midorikawa.
I just wanted to see what you looked like: the man who came face-to-face with a Gauna.
What?
Tanikaze! Are you okay?
That's right. You said you were hungry.
What?
That's why I wanted to talk to Tanikaze to sort out the facts.
What?
Akai wins!
Mochikuni Akai has done it!
but Akai came out on top with a magnificent single-point win.
I'm buying his and one more.
Wow, this is really good!
I feel that she could replace me with her insight into combat.
Have there been any signs of movement from the Gauna?
Are you okay?
I'm glad you two weren't badly hurt.
Hello again.
What?
Welcome to the sea.
I didn't think something like this would be on Sidonia.
If would've been nice if Akai and Momose could ride with us.
It's heading towards Sidonia.
Understood.
Commence mid-range initial engagement.
But keep your eye on your reserves.
Yes, sir!
I'll take out the target!
Ready when you are, Akai.
I'm going in!
Look at that stuff trailing from G491!
Placenta stakes have perforated the frame.
bgPhotosynthesize?
She hasn't been home much lately because of work.
Thank you so much for bringing her... I mean, it, back to us.
q2the Gardes-type Gauna which fled from the last battle truly felt like it was piloted by a human to me.
It will be treated as an application for special leave.
Everyone is really divided on the issue.
It answered?
What's wrong?
It is crossing level one defense line.
From the perspective of a scientist,
I understand.
More have fallen.
Do you think...
Don't you want to unwind for a bit?
All right!
The Gauna is using Hoshijiro's com signal!
Hoshijiro!
I'm fine.
I wanted to talk to you.
She hasn't been home much lately because of work.
What's she do?
Nice to meet you.
An experiment?
For Nagate?
Nagate.
I'm Tahiro Numi from the EBD.
It even has something akin to emotions.
q2the Gardes-type Gauna which fled from the last battle truly felt like it was piloted by a human to me.
You rely on your Hyggs cannon way too much.
You guys could slay a million Gauna and I wouldn't photosynthesize with you.
I have made arrangements as per your instructions.
The details are, of course, classified,
We're probably going to be promoted, what with the lack in manpower.
Want to go eat there?
It seems to have calmed down.
Because you're the lancer.i hope people wont see this as a fate reference, because it isnt. ive been trying to treat the gardes squads as cavalry units where possible, and a lancer is a mounted lance-wielding soldier, so i think this is the best possible translation. id accept alternative translations for soldiers wielding spears or lances if they dont sound dumbseems fine to me
What if the Gauna didn't just take human form,
Stop it, Hoshijiro!
I mean, look at the Hoshijiro placenta!
What is it?
Don't you want to unwind for a bit?
Yeah.
Ca-Ca-Captain?!
This is great!
It can't be a coincidence.
Look at page 139.
And this here is the key that will allow us to enter the facility.
What?! You're going in?
Calm down, Izana-kun!
Come on!
Tanikaze-san!
Well, this sucks.
What is it, Tanikaze-san?
Grandchild?
I want to show you something.
In the midst of the Fourth Defense War,
The Kunato family is not cleared to pass it.
Yes.
Well, she really is wearing a mechanic's suit.
Oh wow.
Distance to Sidonia is 5000 kilometers.
Tanikaze-san.
Guess the Gauna is out of range.
Projectile has pierced the core.
Congratulations.
It's not really well-known and doesn't appear in Guide To Sidonia.
The sound your sandals make is really bugging me.
because you said you had the perfect plan.
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't double-booked us!
Yep, this sure wouldn't make it into the guide.
I'm the owner of Gravity Hall. My name is Tanaka.
You seem to be liking it after all.
The executed was well-known among the upper echelons:
I've found out that what remains of his research is buried under the ground lake.
Yes. Even in battle it always chased the frame that was carrying a Kabizashi.
Open! Open!
Look at this.
How did you know it was here?
I didn't know you were so good at this.
Why?
This is completely off-limits to me normally.
What about Yuhata?
We now have the power to exterminate the Gauna.
i1Endless oceans, endless plains.
Guess you over there must be the famous Tanikaze then.
Huh?
All right, we will start testing tomorrow.
Distance between Gauna and pioneers is 80 kilometers.
Sortie.
704, Tanikaze.
Sortieing.
Roger.
Is this for real?
Guess the Gauna is out of range.
Gauna has made contact with the emigrants.
What about the emigrants?
They made me a pilot today.
Especially among new recruits.
It's closing in at high speed.
Why is it so huge?
Is that the Gauna?
G542 is on a head-on collision course with Sidonia.
I will change our trajectory 0.5 using thruster No. 2 to perform evasive measures.
Do it.
Please brace for emergency acceleration and stay indoors.
But G541 attacked the emigrant pioneers.
There is no doubt the Gauna are drawn to kabi.
Granted.
Firing anti-planet missile!
Platoon 2 commander. Roger.
Formation!
Today, she faces yet another crisis.
but if there is anything I can do to protect Sidonia, I will do it.
Some here are barely more than trainees!
bgIt's so huge!
bgHow am I supposed to fight this monster?!
90 destroyed!
We're almost there, platoon 2!
i1What now?
We might not be able to change direction later if we fire.
Also, if we suspend artificial gravity and other core systems, this will affect the residential areas.
Please make sure to affix your safety harness.
Please make sure to affix your safety harness.
i1This entire world should end.
It's twenty times as long as Sidonia.
There's no way we can survive that.
Please brace for emergency acceleration and stay indoors.
Firing thruster one.
Killing thrusters.
How can it be so mobile?
The Gauna almost invariably dodge the missile or shoot it down before it hits.
Granted.
At once?
but if there is anything I can do to protect Sidonia, I will do it.
And this battle will be under the dwarf planet's gravity.
Some here are barely more than trainees!
Relative speed is zero.
Those are the different Gauna that make up the system!
Fire!
Platoon 2 has begun simultaneous firing.
It's impossible! We can't dodge it!
We can't destroy all the cores alone!
i1What can I do with the forces I have?
i1One more hour.
Captain!
Enter through that hole and slay the Master Gauna.
I repeat.
Why is it so huge?
Enter through that hole and slay the Master Gauna.
Hyggs particle interference is affecting coms more than expected.
Attack at once.
What are you going to do, Tanikaze?
Tsugumori has the prototype backpack propulsion system.
We'll shake it off!
But you're alone!
Com link lost!
Reallocating Hyggs particles to residential areas.
All we can do is pray now, huh?
There's nothing we can do at his altitude!
Respond, Tanikaze!
What about platoon 1?
Tanikaze-san!
Hoshijiro speaking.
Benisuzume is closing in.
Samari!
Let go of me and leave!
It's a Gardes!
It's one... no, seven frames!
G542, a massive Gauna that contained an entire dwarf planet,
Kunato!
is for all of them to be happy.
It was just an accident.
Orbit the Gauna!
Shock waves spreading.
Interior exposed.
Attack at once.
Roger!
I can make it in time if I go alone!
It's you who gets all the special gear again, huh?
Izana!
Ten minutes until missile impact!
Hoshijiro speaking.
One frame heavily damaged.
Benisuzume is closing in.
Seii!
Stay with us! That's an order!
and the only thing I really want
Listen now.
Mozuku.
My father passed away without warning.
Gauna need neither air nor food originally.
spreading through the universe to consume all its resources like locusts.
q2I'm saying you and the others are dirty, rotten beings, reeking of food scraps and excrement!
Wh-What are you doing?
Hoshijiro!
I was looking for you!
The placenta specimen?
I think this is enough food for you two.
Nagate hasn't been eating much lately.
Sorry.
I made food for us!
I'll go alone.
Which is?
I won't probe into its whereabouts.
G549 has already penetrated the level two defense line.
Analysis coming in!
I'm ready now!
Keep to the battle plan and don't approach further.
If we can overwhelm its regeneration, we will eventually pierce the core.
Assume a double file formation and attack in waves.
Numerous hits on impact location.
Placenta is further regenerating!
It's coming from the final defense line.
New Gauna at high speed.
I made a chimera.
This Gauna is no enemy.
Is that Hoshijiro?
Gardes squads, prioritize destroying the Gauna's core.
Disperse and fire at will!
Frame 193, frame 318, contact lost!
Pull back, Tanikaze.
Be careful!
You will not do a thing.
A-Anyway, Tanba-san.
Put access restrictions on his entire research.
It is an honor and a privilege to meet all of you.
The failures of that day lay in our imperfect control over the chimera.
You need only issue an order.
Do you think we're stupid?
You're no different from the Gauna!
Allow us to take our leave.
I'm so happy!
As you wish.
When was this decided?
The days are shorter now.
i1It did not take long for him to finish what he promised he would: produce a chimera.
What about the colonists, then?
The large hive cluster is slowly approaching the Lem star system, I hear.
Sidonia has utterly no hope of victory given its current state.
I'd love to see it!
Are you okay?
How long have I been unconscious?
Do you have a minute?
"Chimera of Human and Gauna."
What are you doing here, Yuhata?
Yeah.
You too, Yuhata.
But that's the third defensive line.
I wish to see more of the chimera's capabilities.
Be careful!
Chimera Tsumugi will soon make contact with the targets.
This isn't right.
It's a trap!
the colony ship that was headed to the Lem star system.
Prepare Gardes squads for launch.
Vanguard units have all targets locked-on.
Open fire!
Ignore the comm link for now.
Bubble disintegration for all Gauna confirmed.
What?
Well done, Tsumugi.
I won't let them do that to my friends.
I can still fight!
You cannot fight any longer.
I will annihilate the Gauna by myself!
Hyggs particle density spike detected within Tsumugi.
Tsumugi!
Damn it! I'll hit Tsumugi!
Izana-san!
Gardes squads have eliminated the second wave.
I've had enough of Gauna stomachs.
Oh shit!
All frames, clear the Gauna's front.
Search for survivors.
Help me...
What's the status of the chimera?
Hyggs particle density spike detected within Tsumugi.
Samari!
I'm so glad you and Sidonia are okay!
Neither do you.
The battle was something else.
You'll get used to it. Don't worry.
The colony ship sent down a vanguard and was attacked on the way back to Sidonia, right?
Yeah.
Will he be okay?
Thank you!
You looked rather happy in your sleep.
Ta-Tanikaze-san?
Thank goodness.
I brought this fella when I heard you had came to.
I will!
It will soon undergo trials.
Wow, you can see the stars from here.
Yes.
What's wrong, Nagate?
You've been really quiet.
What if something happens?
Why are you in such a rush, Nagate?
Set course for orbit around Planet Nine.
Did you hear something, Nagate?
Nope.
Ready for thruster firing.
We're out, Nagate!
We made it.
There isn't a single one here who doesn't know you.
Stop making fun of me, Grandma.
I was a bit worried since you were taking so long to recover.
See you, Grandma.
See you, Grandma.
Izana?
You must have been lonely.
and it made me want to see you.
I wish we had peace.
Yup!
Thank you again.
This is about something else entirely, though.
I'm looking for property with a lot of out of commission pipes.
This area on the outer wall would be nice.
Hello!
What are you making?
Did you model it yourself?
Thank you for showing me the object.
You know, if you're okay with it
Wow!
Don't worry.
I'm pretty strange.
But be careful.
We should go to bed.
Non-essential personnel are to evacuate the premises at once.
It looks like a Gauna.
Operators, can you hear me?
Be prudent.
Beginning emitter activation.
Captain?
Captain?
Magnificent.
The emitter is not responding to my commands.
Tanikaze-san.
XO, look at this.
There is a tunnel in it roughly 100 kilometers in radius.
Can't you trace the gravity malfunctions?
Sortie all the reserve units on standby.
There is no indication how it reached Sidonia's shell.
Why aren't we getting any updates?
Stop!
The first priority is gathering information.
We induced Gauna placenta to form into a machine that was thought to be impossible to produce.
The project has failed.
Understood.
It's huge!
It's been a long time, Sasaki.
I haven't.
This'd be a ghost ship without you and Tsumugi.
I want to photosynthesize.
Nothing much.
But don't take that to mean you're under surveillance or something.
Hey, Yuhata.
Quiet, Yuhata!
Why was she mad at us?
I'm not playing cards with you!
If Sidonia even exists anymore.
Answer!
So, intersex people adapt depending on their chosen partner.
Roger.
Coming through!
You've got to be kidding me.
What's going on?
I'm quite familiar with them.
Morning.
It'll relay your Gardes' status info straight to your brain.
Oh... Okay.
Come on, don't be shy.
I haven't done this in a quite a while.
I'm sorry!
His girl?!
this bitch?
Tell me!
Right.
Tsumugi!
What's going on?
Look at those two.
I was right behind you on the way home!
I don't understand why she's so upset.
Yure-san!
What about Izana?
Any more demands?
We can take tomorrow and the day after off.
I guess you don't want to spend a night in some decrepit place.
I'll come.
Thank you, Izana!
You're up early, eh?
What's the matter?
This is the entrance, huh?
Let's go, Nagate!
Yeah.
the Thousand Year Village.
Nagate?
Floor joints in order.
Hello?
Tsumugi.
What are you doing?
She loves baths!
Wait!
This is dangerous, Izana!
You don't actually care about me, right?
So what did Tanikaze-san tell her?!
Capturing Nine will determine the course of the war.
Shinatose speaking.
Okay.
A pilot that was supposed to fly on tomorrow's recon mission deserted and was arrested.
Stop dallying around!
Don't forget to check the quasi-inertial controller one last time.
It's here!
Hayakaze will decelerate to permit linkup.
Maximum output.
I'm really worried for Izana-san.
I wanted to be there for her.
What was that?
It's too large!
You don't actually care about me, right?
Roger.
Take it easy with her.
There is a haze of sorts in our flight path.
It's an invisible Gauna!
064, medium damage.
Midorikawa, draft a strategy to exterminate the Gauna around Planet Nine.
Kunato-kun?
That one too.
Just go with your best guess.
Okay.
The Gauna react to kabi and high-density Hyggs particles.
I can feel something deep inside the atmosphere.
He crashed at very high speed.
I can't believe it's undamaged after that crash.
Tsumugi!
Benisuzume?
95 identical!
It's definitely Benisuzume!
Come on!
This way!
She's fine.
an8Tanikaze.
an8I think the Gaunabane Sword lost a lot of its edge with that first cut.
Benisuzume has launched a second volley of stakes.
Tsumugi's Hyggs particle density is dropping further.
Where is it?
ED
Placenta is compromising your frame!
Destroy the core!
Gauna,
How are we doing?
Captain.
Good.
Last bubble disintegration confirmed!
What of the large hive cluster?
Yes?
Important things must have a spare.
It is disheartening to fight without a hero's banner under which to rally.
Um, here.
Take this with you.
i1So much has happened to me.
I'm home, Grandpa.
so I am given to understand it was sealed.
Of course.
Huh, he does appear to have clearance.has clearance apparently.
Oh, I'm very sorry for your loss.
Gardes production may have been reallocated to Toha Heavy Industries,
What do you mean?
They can store the equivalent of a complete human brain or an artificial intelligence.
What's wrong?
Ouch.
I've had enough.
Kunato?
I cannot be more specific, but we are putting it to constructive use for all of Sidonia.
H-Hold on a second!
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I have an order for you from the captain.
Forget about the specimen.
Everyone is still floored.
There is one target.
Single core.
All frames within range.
The other two squads will take a forward echelon formation and back him up.
This is odd.
Assume a double file formation and attack in waves.
a new Gauna?
It's still accelerating.
Extremely high-density Hyggs particle reaction detected in new Gauna!
It's a pleasure to meet you all.
Hello, everyone.
Where is Kobayashi?!
Do come in.
Where is it?
Ouch!
Are you okay, Tanikaze?
Wait!
What are you doing?
Are you mad?!
I know this voice.
Low-resolution analysis of its interior coming in.
Human being detected in the new Gauna's core!
Everyone, be careful!
It might fire again.
This is a good opportunity.
Kunato?
Transfer complete.
Now we have full access to Ochiai's research.
Ochiai's research bestowed great wonders upon Sidonia.
I will be the only one who touches it directly.
with all the resilience that comes with it.
That simply cannot happen.
q2Having personally borne witness to the catastrophe of a century ago, those words ring hollow.
I was only a little afraid.
Did that happen when you defended me?
Oh, good!
Tsumugi!
My deepest apologies for what just occurred.
Go away, monster!
Let them in.
Please come in.
Really?
Thank you so much!
Uh, okay, I guess?
That was... something.
Then Kobayashi shall be removed from her position.
None.
I attend in Captain Kobayashi's place.
Good work.
There is only one way to ensure the survival of the human race,
The line of sight from Planet Seven is blocked by the system's sun.
No chimeras!
No chimeras!
I have a lot of experience.
i1was that such a good idea?
We have no choice but to fight.
Have you forgotten the trouble Benisuzume gave you?
What is it?
I want to photosynthesize!
She's gonna love it!
Tanikaze!
Yeah.
You too, Yuhata.
Okay.
We'll be fine now.
the exercise today is about entering a mixed formation between you and Gardes.
Are you ready?
So we lost contact with them because they were annihilated by the Gauna.
The Gauna have made a container out of placenta.
The Gauna have made a container out of placenta.
Tsumugi is trapped along with the Gauna.
Father, the placenta is contracting.
Shall we test the usefulness of your claws sheathed in man-made kabi?
and our communications can no longer reach it.
Eliminate them while they're still at range.
Roger.
Second wave will soon be within core-piercing projectile range.
Open fire!
Roger!
All Gardes units are undamaged.No damage on Gardes units. Hits still being recorded on the second wave.
Roger.
We have no information from the inside.
Communications with Tsumugi are still cut.
No readings of Gauna presence.
I can still fight!
i1Cease this madness, Tsumugi!
Tsumugi!
Pilot wounded!
Annihilate them!
Eat this!
Roger.
It's aiming straight for Sidonia!
Hyggs particle density in G550 is increasing drastically.
Hurry!
Hyggs particle density is rising inside G550 again.
Core exposed!cool original sequence
Fire!
Izana, can you hear me?
i1Cease this madness, Tsumugi!
H-How's Tsumugi?
Don't worry.
and are now stationed in the hangar.
They're useful.
I'll pass.
Good night.
I wonder if he's sleeping properly.
so it's only a matter of time until she regains consciousness.
When did I doze off?
I'm so happy!
Sidonia will decelerate to enter the star system on schedule.
It should be, according to the map I got from the administration division.
I just remembered!
Reaching maximum deceleration.
There must be so many people living in here.
I wish I was human-sized and could get to know them.
Izana?
Izana?
Can I stay at your place tonight?
Come on in.
I heard some weird sounds earlier.
Don't worry.
You must have been lonely.
I was thinking about how often we'll get to meet before it's over,
Doctor Yure.
This weapon is of central importance for our war with the large hive cluster.
We will now test a mixed formation of Type 18 Gardes with the new Type 17 Tsugumori Mark 2.
A quad formation with the Tsugumori Mark 2 proves to be quite speedy.
It feels good to have perfected the new propulsion system.
Tsumugi speaking.
We'd never catch up with her.
I... I don't really know.
Very well?
This area on the outer wall would be nice.
let alone time to visit.
What are you making?
Are you serious?!
When I was little I read about it in "Fictional Weapons".
Thank you for showing me the object.
You know, if you're okay with it
It's pretty far from the station.
This place is great!
I know, right?
The pipes are quite roomy, so getting here was very comfortable.
Yup!
You look a little down.
We should go to bed.
It's okay.
Current distance is 180,000 kilometers.
Opening supply.
We're ready to fire.
All matter within 100 kilometers of the emission axis has been annihilated.
Captain?
Rumbling.
Emitter is active.
Yes. It is more powerful than projected.
The experiment is over.
What happened?
This is the rogue planet on flyby.
There is a tunnel in it roughly 100 kilometers in radius.
What just happened?
Can't you trace the gravity malfunctions?
Put it on the screen.
I don't know.
Is that still not enough?
Whose zone is that?
Sounds like trouble.
Don't stop me!
It's too strong!
Unknown oscillations detected.
Oh, no!
What of the Gauna?
The other squads will assist with damage control.
It is believed the Gauna was inhabiting a nearby dwarf planet,
Do whatever it takes to control it.
It's a prototype for a Gardes Independent Support System.
It's a sword made from leftover artificial kabi.
En, have you still not apologized to Tanikaze for punching him?
If you don't do it, you might never get to.
Tanikaze is on standby today, so he should be in the waiting area.
I want to photosynthesize.
I think my suit's broken.
I told you this is my suit!
Permission denied.
Who could that be?
I see.
You've got a nice place.
If you've chosen to be a woman, it means you found a man!
Shuttle speaking. We can hear you loud and clear.
If Sidonia even exists anymore.
I think we're all rooting for him.
Coming through!
Now you're surprised.
A heated table!
You're home, Grandma.
Right! Izana.
I still have some of my old clothes from when I was young.
Thanks for tagging along.
And who is
Doesn't it remind you of all the fun we used to have?
Tell me!
Stay out of my room, Tsumugi!
We're done here, too.
I'm sorry!
Well. All right.
I don't want to hear it!
Welcome back.
And?
You can just flat out tell me if you're inviting me on vacation.
I'm not used to this.
Really?
What's the matter?
Nothing!
We should make it on time.
Let's go, Nagate!
I-Izana.
If you can't complete the mission in the time given,
This is no vacation!
Izana!
Holy cow.
Let's go, Nagate!
It's even more stunning up close!
Pay him no mind at all, Tsumugi.
Be gentle.
Now over there.
Hello?
Tsumugi.
This one?
Is that really it?
How would I know?
Um... Right!
Yeah.
q2Being able to use Nine as a natural fortification will be crucial in our fight against the large hive cluster.
Kobayashi.
It's called Hayakaze and we'll do test flights along with recon around Planet Nine.
A pilot that was supposed to fly on tomorrow's recon mission deserted and was arrested.
Return to Sidonia as quickly as possible.
Yeah.
Shinatose, what's wrong?
There is a haze of sorts in our flight path.
Something is coming!
This is my grandmother's handwriting.
What the hell?!
Okay.
Take it easy with her.
Let's try to fire at it with a Hyggs cannon.
512, 723, what's your status?
Trying to locate squad members.
It's like prodding a beehive.
I mean, XO Midorikawa.
Hardly difficult foes.
q2This is an excellent opportunity to obtain combat data prior to engaging the large hive cluster.
Ouch!
Um, Pilot Tanikaze?
We're fine.
Tanikaze's frame has crashed into a floating island.literal, change to whatever you want
Respond.
Most of the older modules didn't survive the impact.
Yeah.
The atmosphere is impairing our com link.
It's far larger than any previous Gauna!
It's definitely Benisuzume!
It's still alive?!
Benisuzume.
Should we really be venturing this far?
Izana!
We can still improve it.improve it? this sounds weird in this context
I will penetrate your core now.
Tanikaze has made contact with Benisuzume.
The frame itself is fine, but the controls are blown to hell.
What are you waiting for?!
Destroy the core!
I'm almost there!
Protect them!
Sounds good.
Destroy them all.
They've been annihilated.
Planet Nine has been conquered.
That was a good battle plan, XO Midorikawa.
Does he have to return to Sidonia with all that inside?
We can't eject the placenta from the cockpit without endangering the pilot.
I'm a bit worried Tanikaze will submit to his male urges and ravage the placenta.
All frames, return to Sidonia.
Guess we've earned ourselves a respite.
In recognition of your valor during the conquest of Planet Nine
Come on, Ren.
Who the hell are you?
It is disheartening to fight without a hero's banner under which to rally.
Um, here.
G604 has penetrated the first defensive line.
q2I'm amazed he's alive after hitting his head that hard and being sent flying ten meters through the air.
You said he went after the rice facility, right?
I'll pass.
Hoshijiro.
Sidonia is ruled by undead!
The surface?
One day, he dies, and then you slowly run out of supplies.
I will be your legal guardian from here on out.
Oh, this?
The Mole Man?
Is that so?
You probably don't know, having lived underground,
We can successfully procreate with both men and women.
So they made a new frame, huh?
Exactly.
Stop floundering around!
Get a move on.
Holy shit, it really is Tsugumori.
Thirty seconds until mining squads reach mission area.
What happened?!
All frames, full speed ahead!
The time it will buy us is minimal,
Preparing Heavy Mass Driver!
What about Tanikaze? What should we do with Tsugumori?
Fire.
Tanikaze-kun!
The Gauna is copying pilot Yamano!
Respond, Tanikaze!
Shinatose, retreat!
30 seconds until HMD projectile impact!
That hive cluster is within three light years of Sidonia.
It's within our level 3 danger zone.
He's jinxed, I tell you.
Sorry, we're in a hurry.
About one hundred years ago.
During the Fourth Gauna Defense War, our food factory was destroyed.
Correct.
This allows us to only have to eat once a week.
See you later!
Probably from all that food you keep eating!
Tanikaze!
No, I don't.
Hurry! Hurry!
You threw up suddenly and passed out.
Must've been pretty traumatic.
Oh? Back on your feet already?
I think it's fine, but they told me not to take the cast off.
These four are Sidonia's finest Gardes pilots.the best Gardes pilots Sidonia has to offer.
I'm fine, really.
Could you accompany him back to class?
Did he leave already?
Wow! They came to see Kunato!
You're Tanikaze Nagate-san, right?
Copy that. Preparing Heigus particle cannon.
Oh, shit!
Yes, ma'am.
Check all safety belts.
T-minus five, four, three, two, one.
Ignition.
Heavy damage to residential tower.
Captain, at this rate...
Cut thrusters immediately.
Gauna 487 remaining on course.
Right away.
Um, did Akai and his squad really...?
All right. Launch the retrieval team now.
Roger.
Brother!
Nagate...
Kabizashis.
Good.
Retrieval team, report your status.
We're about to arrive at the Kabizashi's estimated trajectory.
Sir, its Ena is morphing again.
Emergency disengagement!
En...
Hoshijiro, cut your thrusters now!
All right!
Pilot status unknown.
Follow orders, Tanikaze!
The Gauna and Tanikaze are still on a collision course.
Contact!
Incredible.
What? Tanikaze, stop! Hey!
Don't, Tanikaze.
Communication lost!
Impressive!
With its propulsion system, it will take it about three days to reach Sidonia.
He was on the team that encountered the Gauna that was repelled a few days ago.
Hold on! I'll call a medic!
Wow!
Oh, right.
With your injuries you're out of the running for the trophy.
Yes.
i1Tanikaze Nagate was able to go toe to toe with a Gauna in it and survive.
Start!
I'm Momose.
I just did the same as I would have done in the VR Simulator.
No, no.
Thank you, Tanikaze.
I have a fair idea of what happened based off what I gleaned from the Gardes repair records.
over his shoulder.
Winner: Akai!
Wait, Kunato!
Stop it, Kunato-kun!
Tanikaze-kun!
I ruined it for you.
The best in Sidonia?
Yeah!
I'm sorry I'm hounding you all the way to your room, Tanikaze.
There's a sea up here?
Welcome to the reservoir.
Look, Nagate!
Subjugation Squad for Gauna 487 has sortied.
Suppress the placenta's regen.
On it.
I have starboard.
Careful, Akai!
Akai-kun!
shikkari shiroListen to me!
The subjugation squad has been annihilated.
I'm sorry, Momose.
Momose!
Momose!
Momose, cardiopulmonary arrest.
Evaded HMD projectile!
Yes, ma'am!
This is a gravity alert!
Sidonia is about to undergo emergency acceleration.
These are all full too.
What are you doing here?
All systems ready.
Kill thrusters!
It's clearing the final defensive area.
We're working on it.
I'm a full Gardes pilot.
Are you really in a bathysphere with Tanikaze-san?!
He said meeting you really helped with the nervousness.
Roger.
We will arrive soon at the location where the Kabizashi was last spotted.
Quad formation.
Good.
G487 is doing something new.
What?
Relaying video.
Shit.
How are the other frames?
Hoshijiro's Hyggs engine is out of control.
Contact with pilot lost!
Respond! Tanikaze!
He's approaching the Gauna.
I repeat.
Roger.
Don't, Tanikaze-kun.
He's about to cross the line of no return.
Adrift.
T minus 5 seconds until contact.
G487 bubble disintegration confirmed.
Tanikaze has defeated the Gauna.
Damage to Tanikaze frame: heavy.
Please be careful.
I know.
Tanikaze has crossed the line of no return.
End of operations.
Yeah.
I heard it all.
There's about a week's worth of water for each of us.
Where did you get your emergency training?
Er... Nothing.
Although the Gauna has been defeated, the threat from the hive cluster is ever-present,
To conduct a more detailed investigation, the expeditionary force entered the structure,
q2Isn't it obvious Hiroki took that kid and hid underground because he got sick of how things were up here?
and how many there are.
Isn't it possible we are just too different to communicate on any level?
How's it look, Tanikaze-kun?
No water or food left.
Listen to me!
Put it on the main screen.
I don't think the ship's defense wing has ever collectively mutinied.
No, we wouldn't have lasted much longer.
Aw.
The men's room is the other way.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
And there's somewhere I want to go.
It's basically back to normal.
If Tanikaze grew up learning from Saitou,
It's delicious fried.
I see.
a mob has gathered to demonstrate against Sidonia's militarization,
Come on! Come on!
Congratulations, Nagate!
Wow!
En's the one who broke your nose!
I'm the same generation as you guys now, Shinatose Izana-kun.
Captain!
Get in.
O-Okay.
You recommended yourself.
There you are, Tanikaze-san!
I guess so.
Are you coming too, Izana-kun?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
The door will now open.
Two persons are in the bathysphere.
i1I earned all my praise the hard way.
Assemble a subjugation squad at once.
Hoshijiro!
No time to waste, Tsuruuchi.
You don't look good.
I'm fine.
The same responsibility lies with me, having not issued the right commands.
Killing reverse thrusters in 15 seconds.
Roger.
Dissolve formation!
115, 013, severe damage!
Hoshijiro, three charges!
Kunato's squad has placed 12 charges.
Leave him!
It wasn't Tanikaze's fault alone that the tail was not severed.line needs changing for batch
The same responsibility lies with me, having not issued the right commands.
You killed Hoshijiro.
Then you need the resolve for it, even if it's hard.
Nagate!
As encounters with the Gauna become more frequent,
For as long as the Gauna exist, we cannot rebuild our homeland.
I understand.
Yeah, I heard.
But I'm not a girl.
Origin of hive-type Gauna G488.
Midorikawa Yuhata, on the bridge.
Traversing gas layers.
Abnormality!
Midorikawa.
Tanikaze-san...
Don't even think about trying to blame me.
Nothing else.
Undead.
What?
Tanikaze will support me.
Where's that voice coming from?!
The Gauna is using Hoshijiro's com signal!
Can you hear me?
Kunato!
What's wrong, Tanikaze?
Stop it!
You have orders!
It's so fast.
It's like it knows exactly how we operate.
005, Samari speaking.
Only one more frame now.
Sample retrieved!
Honoka Ren, Hou.
Hou!
and is presently exploring special Gardes-type tactics.
What sort of sample is this?
Artificial gravity has recovered to almost 1G.
Captain.
Why was he taken alive?
i1It was almost as if she had swapped with Hiroki.
Saitou-san's replacement clone was lost in the war.
We cannot afford losing him again.
Not much longer!
Don't move until I order you to!
I will teach all I know to this child.
You won't get him!
So fast!
Get here, Izana!
An animal?
It's still a Gauna!shortened sentence
bgPhotosynthesize?
Something up, Grandma?
I'll come home when I have time off.
You're Tanikaze Nagate-kun, right?
Thank you!
I'm Tahiro Numi, and I work here at the EBD.
It reacted.
So far we've worked under the assumption that the Gauna are incapable of human intellect.
We have to reevaluate our tactics now.
Like we're going to lose in a straight-up Hyggs cannon standoff.
It has no recoil and works fine for stripping away their placenta,
Do it.
Gate open.
and very nearly destroyed this ship therewith.
The people boarding the emigration ships think that the Gauna won't attack if you have no Kabizashi.
Everyone is really divided on the issue.
They want me at the EBD.
Let's start then.
It seems to have calmed down.
Try talking to it.
Ta... ni... ka... ze... kun.
Because you're the lancer.i hope people wont see this as a fate reference, because it isnt. ive been trying to treat the gardes squads as cavalry units where possible, and a lancer is a mounted lance-wielding soldier, so i think this is the best possible translation. id accept alternative translations for soldiers wielding spears or lances if they dont sound dumbseems fine to me
Can't you just order him as the XO to stay away?
Aren't you supposed to consider the pilots' psychological well-being?
Cheer him up, huh?
What would be the difference between that placenta and the real human being?
Exactly, Tanikaze-san.
Ca-Ca-Captain?!
I'm Midorikawa; I put in a reservation.
There's no way we'll get in with just one key.
Getting this key was quite difficult.
Nagate?
Out of the way, Izana-kun.
No reception?!
The man is still standing.
I'm Shinatose Yure.
Don't be alarmed.
No, it's not.
Captain!
Chimera?
In the midst of the Fourth Defense War,
We should be on our way back.
I... don't really remember anything.
Me... neither.
Gardes backpack propulsion system.
Is this an SHSSuper High Speed Accelerator?
This simulator is still under development.
Is the propulsion system ready for use?
The simulator we're developing
What?
704, Tanikaze.
"Composite projectile of artificial kabi and ordinary mass."
He won't make it.
He was amazingly able to account for the firing error with the second shot.
Especially among new recruits.
Leave me alone!
We still have time together!
Nagate, you went to the placenta again, didn't you?
Whatever!
A hive type, huh?
Why did they switch back to Sidonia?
G542 has changed course.
It is back on a collision course.
The Gauna in the back of the hive are forming a propulsion system.
We'll use the anti-planet missile.
Send them out when you're done.
We're in formation.
Target reached.
Fire!
Focus on evasion!
The barrage will be much lighter close to the surface.
Platoon 1, after me!
Shed it!
We will probably have enough CPP ammo!
We're almost there, platoon 2!
It's impossible! We can't dodge it!
Another eight!
Try it.
We're supposed to go inside?
We will slay the Master Gauna!
Target acquired.
I can't see anything! I can't do it!
It's impossible! We can't dodge it!
Enter through that hole and slay the Master Gauna.
Roger!
Yeah.
Hole has fully closed!
Reallocating Hyggs particles to residential areas.
Is it trying to shoot down the anti-planet missile?!
The engine is threatening to overload.
The engine will overload.
The Master Gauna is beyond that wall!
Implosion detected!
It's a Gardes!
was approaching Sidonia at high speed.
Kunato!
Thanks!
If that's what it is, then...
The Gauna has fired a Heigus particle beam at Tanikaze.
Was he trying to cause a Heigus explosion?
Izana, let's go.
Oh, okay.
There's no reason for you to die too.
Huh?
It's so pretty, Hoshijiro.
What?
Based on the amount of food and water we have, I would say ten days is all we have.
At this point, you shouldn't have had that much training experience yet.
But you surprised me since you were so confident in what you were doing.
Debris removal in the residential area has finished up.
the threat of the Gauna Cluster still remains.
Yes. Roughly 500 ships.
If you space out, you'll be left behind.
It was nearly 600 years ago when the strike team discovered a large, mysterious structure.
It was speculated it was constructed by intelligent life five centuries after Sidonia launched.
In order to investigate more closely,
After we brought back those elements, we became heroes.
That boy... Nagate is...
Okay...
Sometimes, I think about stuff like that.
But, you know, the first Gauna that descended upon Earth had a human-like form.
but that's the first time something like that had ever happened.
What's wrong, Tanikaze?
What? Empty?
Oh, no.
Any luck, Tanikaze?
What?
Hoshijiro.
Do you think that Sidonia has a prison big enough to lock up 257 pilots?
You know what that means, right?
As long as you're okay with my filtered water.
What?
I've never heard of anyone filtering water from lubricants before.
Yes!
What? It can't be.
They came back for us!
No, it's fine, Mozuku.
But truthfully, didn't you want to drift out there with each other a little longer?
Disengage formation.
Yeah.
Welcome back.
Oh... Did you lose some weight?
Although, the smell didn't go away until just a few days ago.
The organic converter reactors were working around the clock,
Oh, isn't that...?
Nagate Tanikaze, Hiroki Saito's successor.
Do you understand, Kobayashi?
It's not like you care, as long as you can keep on living forever.
While Sidonia was thrilled by the safe return of the stranded cadets,
Three policemen sustained injuries, but none were considered serious.
However, the damage from the diagonal acceleration was quite significant,
Hurry up, come on!
It's amazing.
I know something isn't right with me.
Oh, okay.
That's fine. But the submarine pods can carry four people.
I want to ride with him alone!
Watch out!
Yes, ma'am!
They say that all life began in the sea.
Before you came for me,
Well...
Had he separated the tail more quickly, you might have had a complete victory.
Second Reclamation Station speaking!
Hold it!
You said he went after the rice facility, right?
Want to go check if there's any truth to it?
So?
You're so diligent, Yamano.
Saying you personally know the current head of Kunato Development
As captain of the ship, I will be in charge of his supervision.
If there isn't going to be a battle in our lifetime either,
Martial law has to be lifted!
You're still healthy.
So you decide to go after the rice facility.
You know, I don't get any results when I look up your name in the registry.
Urban combat was a part of it.
You must be Tanikaze Nagate.
A new face!
Tell them who you are.
I'm Tanikaze Nagate.
You're probably wondering which one I am, huh?
Let's do this.
One of only 28 special spears in Sidonia: the Kabizashi.
Your frame is in the fifth lane.
It's a Gauna!
No, thank you.
You've achieved so much, starting from our little town!
A urinal biocatheter?
It'll insert itself on its own, but try not to pull it out.so don't fight it.
we will commence the ice mining mission at 1100.maybe mining?will see
This is Tanikaze's first sortie.
Abort Tanikaze's rescue.
The Gauna's actions are completely meaningless!
Dismissed.
About one hundred years ago.
Shut up!
And he came back a mess.
There!
Honoka Hou and Shinatose used all their spherical explosive ammo.
Judging from the frame's damage, he was in close combat.
Izana?
Must've been pretty traumatic.
It itches.
The seed ship Sidonia now wanders the cosmos to ensure the continued survival of humankind.
I'd seen it a thousand times in the VR simulator underground.
"Yes, I'll do it."
I'm fine, really.
Right.
It's been a while since I last came to the academy.
Midorikawa Yuhata!
There!
Judging from the frame's damage, he was in close combat.
That information was not made public.
Hold on! I'll call a medic!
Got it?
Yes, sir!
Wow!
I really think it's fine.
Next match: Tsuruuchi versus Aoki, in ten minutes.
Have you seen Nagate?
Nah, Kunato is going to win this year.
i1Tanikaze Nagate was able to go toe to toe with a Gauna in it and survive.
Finally I found you!
Midorikawa Yuhata!
What did you think of your first Gauna?
Sorry, Tanikaze.
I'm better than you!
Time to find out!
Yes.
Do you plan to stand on the battlefield, Seii?
Nagate.
Don't worry.
Welcome to the reservoir.
Roger.
Begin operations once contact is seen.
Gauna in sight!
Follow directives and disperse over target!
On it.
The regen is faster than expected!The placenta is regenerating faster than anticipated!
I'm sorry, Momose.
Subjugation squad: Aoki takes command.
I will charge it.
Firing Hyggs cannon.
Stay here, Midorikawa!
Shit!
Spread out!
Roger.
No change in collision course.
I won't repeat myself.
Affix your safety harness to a railing at once and brace for acceleration.
Who cares?!
Evasion successful.
Yes, ma'am!
Any questions?
Even if we collect this one, we're still down one Kabizashi with 27.
Too slow.
Kunato, hurry and retrieve the Kabizashi!
The Gauna won't catch up with a quad formation.
Relaying video.
Hoshijiro's Hyggs engine is out of control.
Gauna has fired its Hyggs particle cannon.
That guy piloting Tsugumori ain't half bad.
Roger.
Yes, I am.
Come back, Tanikaze!
Strike!
What's he planning?
Please be careful.
Oh, Hoshijiro.
Let me.
Sorry!
It has been seven days since the uneven acceleration disaster.
Eight days, huh?
You shouldn't rely on photosynthesis alone.
Yeah. It tastes even better than yesterday.
and how many there are.
That was the first time it appeared like that in almost two hundred years after the first contact.
How are you feeling?
Right!
No way!
We have located Tanikaze Nagate and Hoshijiro Shizuka.
Fully.
Your orders, Captain.
q2we have 256 Gardes returning in formation with two trainees and the frame which sheltered them for eleven days.
How's Sidonia look after three weeks to you?
Dissolve formation.
See you.
Commencing decontamination.
Thanks.
Wow.
I got a little bored not having you to cook for every day.
Glad to have you back.
Did you hear?
Weren't you just as angry, Hou?!
Got some time?
Thank you.
Hey, can I buy you something to drink?
Tempura sauce?
Yeah, really.
Let him through.
Is there a problem?
There's something different about me.
Because he worried about you.
Right now?
Let's go, Izana.
Fine with me.
Don't think I have.
Be careful!
Welcome to the Hyggs-Guided Bathysphere.
We will be launching into the water shortly.
Please hold on to the safety rail.
i1I earned all my praise the hard way.
Assemble a subjugation squad at once.
I felt like I was drifting through the sea.
Hey, wait!
My fault?
I'm fine.
No time to waste, Tsuruuchi.
The presence of a Master Gauna is certain.not just likely, there has to be one
Your secondary objective is to sever the tail.
Roger.
Hoshijiro, three charges!
Honoka, two charges!
Don't miss it!
Prepare for detonation.
Detonation confirmed.
Are you okay, Nagate?
Most importantly, he himself is not in a state to sortie.
The people are a nonissue.
This isn't what Hoshijiro would have wanted.
Sidonia must disarm entirely!
Then you need the resolve for it, even if it's hard.
Yeah.
Okay.
But I'm not a girl.
Thanks!
Are you okay, Nagate?
Put rogue planet N 68203L on the screen.
Missile loaded with high-pressure implosion warhead.
We're ready.
Launching missile!
Observe missile until impact.
Impact in 5 seconds.
A-1-5 and B-4-3, nothing.
K-3-7, nothing.
I want an image analysis!
Why does it always have to be you?
Oh wow...
Launch Nakazono's squad and Samari's squad once they are ready.
Kunato speaking. My squad is ready for launch.
Don't even think about trying to blame me.
That's enough.
What?
Processing image.
Samari's squad takes G489.
Nakazono's takes G490.
Is... that you... Hoshijiro?
Ludicrous!
Another one down.
Samari's squad has finally engaged the target!
G489 has been defeated.
Sample retrieved!
Roger.
"Will there be an announcement for the placenta sample Tanikaze collected?"
One of three... She's still alive.
Is that why he's in every single battle?
Are you going to use Ochiai's auxiliary brain?
after having subjugated a Gauna for the first time in history.
However, many core facilities are heavily damaged,
Where's Hiro gone?!
I'm fine, Lala.
Honestly, you know I hate it when people call me by my first name.
Show me where I am.
Why did Hiroki take Shinatose hostage?
Did you tell her to make a clone of Hiroki?!
Did you plan on leaving him in there until adulthood?
Your life no longer lies in your hands.
Give me time!
Come on, Nagate!
Roger!
Good! Get those charges ready, and detonate!
Detonating!
Roger!
Tanikaze, what are you doing?
Fall back. Are you listening, Tanikaze?
Wait, no. I didn't...
No, our failure to separate the tail was not solely Tanikaze's responsibility.
Forget it, Hoshijiro! Don't go after him!
Stop, Hoshijiro! Don't.
I believe this is blowback from allowing him to pilot the Tsugumori,
We'll send him out.
Fifteen cadets have been promoted to Garde pilots to replenish the front lines.
Also joining them...
I'm gonna tidy up.
Right.
I understand.
Make the preparations.
I heard that too. That's unbelievable, right?
Well, they don't think some of them are going to make it.
Except that I'm not actually a girl.
What?
You war criminal!
Y-yeah...
Good!
I didn't apply for the position!
Tinne till innpact:
Understood!
A-1-5, B-4-3 clear.
Tanikaze.
It can't be.
No. It's 702.
Yeah!
bgPhotosynthesize?
Was that your grandmother?
Trainee Shinatose.
Okay, I'm going to let the light through now.
It even has something akin to emotions.
Speaking of which,
So far we've worked under the assumption that the Gauna are incapable of human intellect.
Man, I think this makes it easier, if anything.
q2fscx90He's somehow gotten into his head that he can photosynthesize alone with you now that he's got three assists.
Why has the captain come to our manor?
q2As it is stored within the deepest part of his research projects, however, I might require some time.
Sidonia is not a ghost ship yet.
Okay.
...power...
This is in compliance with the emigration law
Don't you think it increases the chances of humanity's survival?
Everyone is really divided on the issue.
Hey, are you listening to me, Nagate?
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?
It's an H1-type Gauna.
Nothing!
Morning?he had a wet dream?
What is it?
Want to go on a little vacation soon?
Really?
Doesn't that just mean nobody goes there?
Sorry.
OP
I'm the owner of Gravity Hall. My name is Tanaka.
We look forward to staying here.
This book gives an account of some of the legends that exist in Sidonia.
I know that.
"Voices from the dead."
"The mystery of the Immortal Council."
Hold on!
Nagate?
No reception?!
We will soon leave artificial gravity.
Izana!
No, it's not.
We now have the power to exterminate the Gauna.
We have high hopes to drastically reduce its bulk.
This simulator is still under development.
Midorikawa here.
Now listen!
Let me sortie, Captain.
If we just sit here, the emigrants will die!
Opening all barriers of forward launch tunnel.
704, Tanikaze.
"The physical energy of the impact destroys the placenta while the artificial kabi wounds the core."
But will he make it in time, even with the new propulsion system?
Projectile did not hit the core.
Tanikaze has eliminated the Gauna.
He's not answering.
Stupid Nagate.
I'm not like you.
ED
Wait!
Give me a model of our relative accelerations.
I will change our trajectory 0.5 using thruster No. 2 to perform evasive measures.
Firing thruster one.
How long until collision?
Destroy the dwarf planet.
The archives are quite clear on that matter.
Platoon 2 commander. Roger.
Roger.
There used to be a very skilled man aboard Sidonia who rescued us countless times.
And there is the huge Gauna nest we call a hive cluster.
Lend me your aid.
Start decelerating.
Stop decelerating.
These are observational values from the Gardes!
Stay in formation!
One Gauna has departed the hive!
Sidonia must be protected at all costs.
Enter through that hole and slay the Master Gauna.
We have to!
Please make sure to affix your safety harness.
i1My dream would end with Sidonia.
Prepare our ship for departure, just in case.
Course prediction complete.
I can't see anything! I can't do it!
Missile will undergo final course adjustments.
Ten seconds until impact.
Roger.
Platoon 1 will enter the Gauna through the hole!
Stay back!
Tsugumori has an anti-Hyggs coating.
All reports will cease!
We have to try to destroy it.
No need to save any particles for the way home.
Tsugumori is out of CPP ammo!
Still no IFF signal!
Missile will impact the dwarf planet!
Where are the others?
It's a Gardes!
If we were able to extract all the information from the auxiliary brain,
Two objects under 1 kilometer.
That's Hoshijiro's Garde.
702...
Stop, Tanikaze!
Cut out a live sample before we destroy the core?
Another enemy craft down.
Copy!
Be careful!
But Gauna 490 appeared to have gone invisible and fled.
Just like Saito.
We can proceed at any time.
Are you going to use Ochiai's auxiliary brain?
I'm not doing this for me.
What's with her? That's weird.
She's not the grumpy sort.
You forgot Ochiai.
Captured alive?
You're very promising. What is your name, by the way?
Just as Hiroki was leaving.
I didn't know why Hiroki left.
And he soon disappeared after refusing to administer further clones.
All I know is that we can never lose him again.
Stay quiet.
That's a perfectly fine birth weight.
Tell me you didn't make a clone of Hiroki!
Status on the doors?
Lalah!
I can't hold them off for long.
Izana said it would make you feel better.
No matter how hard it tries to imitate us, it's still a Gauna!
Was that your grandma on the phone?
Oh, thank you.
You're Nagate Tanikaze, aren't you?
And you would be?
Oh, hey, if it isn't Tanikaze!
Numi Tahiro from the ERD.
What about the Ena specimen from Gauna 491?
It's recreated something that is very close to human.
It would make it a lot easier if those things were human.
Do me a favor. Let's make this quick.
I need to get three assists to win a photosynthesizing session for two with Samari.
Nagate.
I've done exactly as you have ordered.
Connecting to the auxiliary brain.
Wait! Please! I'm begging you!
It nearly destroyed Sidonia.
Expectations put the potential volunteer numbers around 100,000.
Hey, are you listening, Nagate?
Did you know the pilot's cafeteria just added a gravity stew to their menu?
How are we supposed to know that?
Tanikaze, would you want to go with me sometime?
The ERD?
Again?
You should try talking to it.
Okay.
Are you okay?
A single Gauna approaching from an invisible field has crossed our level-one threat border.
You're the only one he listens to.
I wonder what that was all about.
Tahiro!
Hoshijiro is...
I mean, the Hoshijiro-formed Ena is...
I know it's difficult,
The same day as yours.
Yeah?
Wait, could this be...?
Anyway, I don't remember actually inviting you to come along with us.
It's amazing!
Sounds like you like the place.
I had to go through a lot to get my hands on this key, you know.
What? We're going inside?
Nagate, what's wrong?
What did you find, Tanikaze?
Got it.
I never knew you had this talent, Nagate.
What? I don't have my gravity shoes on today!
Izana is my grandchild.
That's right.
As you can see, the anti-military activists' advance party colony ship has just left Sidonia.
a second wave of colonists will be sent to...
Yes, I've heard.
And how did you know that?
Captain, if we don't hurry, then everyone on the colony ship will be killed!
Sidonia's forward artillery lane gate now open!
704 Tanikaze, deploying!
Are you serious?
He actually defeated a Gauna without a Kabizashi.
Hey! Izana!
And I'm not like you.
Second Reclamation Station speaking!
I hope I'll make it in time.
So, did he die?
Look, it's Kunato and Hoshijiro.
My dream is to one day use it to protect Sidonia from the Gauna.
Abolish the military!
Sidonia is ruled by undead!
The surface?
You lived underground with your grandfather.You used to live with your grandfather, hiding underground.
I represent them.
What do you think of the surface?
Urban combat was a part of it.
I have a request.
I suffered a pretty severe injury when I was younger.
Tell them who you are.
Huh? I heard he was a rice thief.
I figured you must be special with the way they ushered you in and whatnot.
Damn, she's only second.
Search for it!
I wouldn't have lost with a Type 17!
Roger.
Yamano's frame, severe damage!
Starlit Sky.
q2I'm amazed he's alive after hitting his head that hard and being sent flying ten meters through the air.
Creeps me out.
Want to go check if there's any truth to it?
It's our duty to become real pilots posthaste and proudly serve Sidonia.
Do you think this is some sort of game?
How odd that he would appear now.
If there isn't going to be a battle in our lifetime either,
Abolish the military!
Look.
So your name is Tanikaze Nagate.
Is this the police station the man who appeared from underground was brought to?
Apologies!
Lack of photosynthesis must be problematic.
Urban combat was a part of it.
I will be your legal guardian from here on out.
Get changed.
The Mole Man?
Nice to meet you.
I'm neither.
The core of a Gauna lies where the brain and spinal cord would be in a human being.
I wouldn't have lost with a Type 17!
Ice confirmed on nearby dwarf planet.
Okay!
Ready to launch.
This is where I begin, isn't it?
Are always such a challenge
I want to laugh when I'm happy
They say my dreams will come true someday
But when will "someday" come?
I can't wait forever
And run with all my might
This is the Ningenkai, where people live.
You do understand that?
Yes, I do.
And what did he tell you you need to do before you could do that?!
I am going to spend the day today,
Y-Yes sir.
And it said right on the sign, to reduce trash.
You're buying?!
Cool, shall we go then?
Are you hurt?
Isn't it, Fujimoto?
Here you are.
You could show them a little service.
I'm sorry. I forgot to turn it off.
What's the matter, Ms. Sayaka?
Yes. Let's do that.
Uh, sure!
Here I go.
I am so happy to be of help to you!
Sure I'm listening.
Here you are! Sure I'm listening.
Oh thanks. Could you stew it for us?
Huh?
Young lady, I'm going to put this on my regular menu.
Is that all?
This child is always like this at night.
What?
Let me sing for the baby!
Yes!
Flowers blossom in the spring
My heart shimmers with the light
From way over yonder, from far I can hear
Voices of singing
In happiness and in sadness
The baby seems to have stopped crying.
Hey sing us another one!
There's a stage over there! Come on let's go!
In the first half, you were totally wild and unpredictable and in the second half,
Sorry for leaving without a word.
Hm?
You pass.
If you don't want it, give it back!
Yes sir! I'm ready!
In that case
If I could just tell you, "Thank you,"
Right, Ioryogi-san?
Machikirenai yo
Doko ni aru no?
Do you understand?!
Rock, paper...
But, but!
The fact that there's nobody out there that needs healing
Oh, come on.
I still have this much more to hand out.
I'm sorry!
Yes...
We're understaffed you see, so we got delayed in bringing the laundry in.
Uh, this is for you!
I'm Toshihiko!
Well it isn't.
Yes!
Huh? I just wanted to thank you properly.
I'm counting on your help today.
Hurry, teacher!
What in the world is that?
This person is mean!
Is this a place where children live?
Yep. Not worth worrying about.
Oh no! Ioryogi-san is gone!
Oh, my.
She works, does she?
Oh... You're such a good boy, Toshihiko, without even complaining.
I mean I realize she's busy, but you know...
Is she a bad mother?
Really! She's awesome! She's the best!
Th-There's something in here! But, but... why?!
if you're looking for something in return, you'll never be healing.
Just do what you want to do and I think you'll be all right.
I'm going to be late.
But when will "someday" come?
I can't wait forever
What?! Then what kind of job should I look for?
Don't ask me!
Good evening!
I'm Kobato Hanato!
Look at the shape they're in.
Well... I can be clumsy sometimes and...
Apple... lemon... uhh...
What a memory! I'm impressed.
Hello!
We came to pick up my birthday cake today!
Wow, it's your birthday?! Happy Birthday!
Yes!
Here you are. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thank you, Kobato.
I'll try and catch Marina!
I'll be looking forward to your help tomorrow.
Mr. Ueda?
I asked him about it once, but he just said, "It's nothing."
Oh is that right?
I wonder if he's in debt.
or that you seemed like you wanted to say something.
Uh... yes...
You're keeping quiet about working to help the kindergarten, aren't you?
Investigate secretly, I guess.
What are you doing?
A detective?
asks a lot of questions and follows people and stuff like that, right?
Did you notice anything unusual at Bakery Tirol?
Bakery Tirol's cakes are very popular.
If you're looking for a love counselor, try someone else!
What?!
Good night.
Yumi!
What? What I have found out so far is that Bakery Tirol's cakes
are very popular and that the manager is probably worried
Oh! But Mr. Ueda always gives the little children some chocolate for free.
And everybody likes his cakes. That's how much I found out.
Mr. Ueda is kind to everyone.
We really shouldn't be following him like this, but...
Is it someone you don't know?
Mr. Ueda will notice us.
You always work so hard for me, and I feel like I've been taking advantage of that. I'm sorry.
And I enjoy greeting you every day! Besides, my injury...
They were both being considerate for the other.
I got to eat some cake, so I'll be extra sweet and give you one hundred!
Huh?
Hey.
No it isn't! You only get fifty points because you're mean!
It would make you feel so happy
There's nothing to worry about
Iorogi.
Na no ni
Sore de mo mada
Hey! It's Kobato!
What makes you think I'm happy?!
Good morning, Kobato.
Well, I've got to go now, Ioryogi-san.
Baked to perfection
Baked to perfection
In Tenkai there are angels, who are under God's rule.
Demons follow the Devil's rule in Chikai.
And in Ikai, where we are from, we have our master, "Kototonushi" to bow down to.
So we end up losing, and the dude gets turned into a doll for breaking the Nonaggression Act.
Just goes to show that even the amazing "God" can get fed up at times.
Domoto!
What brings you to the kindergarten?
However...
I cannot be seen wearing this dreamy girly thing!
Darn, I can't get it off! That Fujimoto! He tied it too tight!
That ribbon looks very nice on little Ioryogi.
You know why?
Why do you stay in Ningenkai for so long, looking like that?
Well sir, I'm a bird now. I can't help it.
I thought the name lacked thought, so I told him to reconsider,
but then we ended up getting into a fist fight.
So he was picked up and given a name. And that's why he dwells on Iorogi issues.
Get it yourself, "Mister Ioryogi".
You're a sorry sight. Your looks and your name.
I-o-ryo-gi?
What do you see in her?
Then get rid of her.
Kobato is ready!
that she hasn't even been asked to do.
Ioryogi-san! Where are you?!
Minus two-hundred points!
What is it?
Kimi ga shiawase ni naru
On "1, 2, 3!" I'll spread open my arms
I have never seen such an impressive ginkgo tree.
I-It's to go to this place I want to go!
Kobato?
Yes.
I just heard Ioryogi-san's voice, but I don't see him anywhere.
So that's what happened.
I'm going to bring Teacher Fujimoto a whole bunch of leaves!
Too grand. The falling leaves are out of control.
Besides, redevelopment construction is due to begin soon.
Hey. It's not time for kindergarten yet.
They say it's redevelopment.
Such a grand ginkgo. But I guess it can't be helped if it's going to make life easier for us.
And also...
Hey, now you're going completely overboard.
In all I behold and all that I live for
Together, we are one and whole
It was ready to wither and die at any time.
Huh?
Might be that ginkgo tree.
I made these from some branches I got from that ginkgo.
Everybody! Fujimoto made us some building blocks!
Wow! Awesome!
Teacher Fujimoto... We're sorry!
Hey, Teacher Fujimoto! Let's make pictures with leaves together!
Stick a ginkgo leaf here and you get Ginkgoman from the planet of Fujimoto!
There's nothing to worry about
Na no ni
Be my guest and take as many as you like.
Ouch...
D-Dobato...!
Are you alone?
So many sweet potatoes!
Thank you very much.
It's so smoky!
But he didn't tell you not to tag along.
Young lady. How nice to see you.
Wait!
Fujimoto, what are you doing?!
Run away from home?!
I was going to go, but...
Maybe I kind of got lost...
Over here.
Fujimoto can be a pretty good guy.
Well, I should hope so.
This is great!
Yoshimura
Stay back.
My mom and I, we live at my grandpa's house now.
I want to watch more TV at night and play computer games, too.
Who's Ms. Sayaka?
Huh?
Keita!
Oww! What are you doing, you old fart?
Fujimoto, you knew Keita's home phone number?
Mhm, Fujimoto's a good guy.
Issho ni iru kara
Do you think that will make everyone happy?!
Wh... What should I do?! Ioryogi-san?
I can't wait forever
Um... Ms. Chisato gave me these to give to everyone at the kindergarten.
How is she?
I see.
After she's had some rest and feels settled, feed her something that digests well.
Don't pass it off as simple fatigue.
Is just sitting there doing nothing going to make Ms. Sayaka better?
Besides, we've folded one-thousand cranes!
Mhm!
Yes.
If something ever happens to me...
Don't... Don't even...
Okay.
Good for her, considering.
Huh?
Oh is that right?
What's the matter?
You look sad, Kobato.
You know, when we're sick, Mom always makes it for us.
That's right, rice porridge.
Mhm. That will make Ms. Sayaka better for sure.
But how do I make rice porridge?
Feed her something like that and she'll just get worse.
C-Come on, don't cry.
Don't worry. People don't die that easily.
Nothing at all.
Is this what?
Good morning!
Good morning.
And you laugh and reply, "Thank you"
Yes. There was a meeting at their school for the coming bazaar.
Zenshin ni hikari wo atsumete
Akireru kurai
So I understand why you discouraged her.
Let's do it. A bazaar.
Kobato seems to be feeling much better now. Isn't that wonderful?
Yes!
It's very good.
Uh... yes...
I wonder who brought them.
And because I'm going to be the big sister, I'll come to pick her up!
Ah, yes!
Don't say a word to her.
Now you listen to me. Don't be showing your face at her place either.
Huh?
Thank you very much!
Let's all give it our best today!
We put all those posters up together.
It's not too late! People still may come!
This looks like fun.
Domoto...
Bazaar today at Yomogi Kindergarten!
Dokoka ni wasurete kichatta kara kamo
They say my dreams will come true someday
I can't wait forever
What in the world is wrong, Ioryogi-san?
Ioryogi-san, you are all covered in dirt!
Anyway, just listen to me!
Looks like heavy clouds today.
It'll be all right!
I'll bring you something that will surely sell.
Thank you very much!
pretending to be a stuffed doll all day long.
You guys are right into this.
That's all right.
Oh I see. You're a part timer.
You know it's hard to believe such a thing ever happened.
Oh no! It was you?! I-I'm so sorry!
Darn it! I will not... let go... of this box... if I have to... put my life... on the... Woah!
Man, when it rains, it pours, literally.
In any case, I'm hungry.
Huh? Hey wait!
Here you go!
Oh too bad!
I'll get it this time!
Okay, now I'm getting it for sure!
Congratulations!
Yeah, I know it did! You all saw it too, didn't you?
Well it is a pretty small-scale event.
Even if you get drenched in water or shot at by snipers.
Oh that's right! I brought some things I made too. I wonder if they sold.
What? Really?
And your response is still, "is that so?"
Huh?
WHAT?!
Hey! That's not nice, Ioryogi-san!
I bet the reason that child looks so terribly sad
It would make you feel so happy
Oshiete, watashi ni dekiru koto
Sore de mo mada
He was sleeping with his stomach uncovered.
Hey. I'm going to call the police.
Hello. Yomogi Kindergarten.
Well then, please tell Rikako to stay well.
That will make everyone sad.
Kobato!
Teacher Kiyokazu!
I understand that.
Is something wrong?!
His father?
But...
Domoto's there too!
Yes.
Oh?
We're going to get busy again with Christmas decorating tomorrow. Okay?
I'll walk you home.
Ioryogi-san, thank you for waiting.
But that man's going to be okay. And that's good.
Thank you very much!
You're very welcome.
Yeah.
Well then, see you.
Sore nara
Issho ni iru kara
What should I do?
Is all
Yes. Fujimoto dresses up as Santa for us every year.
If you don't mind, that is.
Christmas is so sparkly and pretty.
I don't know. I don't think he likes me anymore.
Oh... but...
It's Christmas inside, too.
Oh, Ioryogi-san, I'd better get you a present, too.
This. I made it for you, Ioryogi-san! Here!
We're having our own Christmas party.
Come to our Christmas party.
Okay!
It's all my fault. The other day, I shouldn't have...
Kobato?
Now he really hates me.
So?
Huh?
Okay.
Were you able to make up with Fujimoto?
Domoto helped us be friends again.
Flowers blossom in the spring
Even though I'm happy
Speaking of which,
so many of the magazines at the convenience store had features on chocolate!
Dou sureba iin dakke?
1 2 3! No aizu de ryoute hirogete
Well, I understand nowadays some boys give to girls too.
She seems to be deep in thought again lately.
So you're saying that you negotiated with the bakery to work there
U-Um. Did I say something wrong?
Oh, I'll be doing the work!
Huh?
Umm... this guy's name is Kurogane.
Huh?
Wh-What is it?
One Mocona?
Something like that.
We can separate the top futon from the bottom futon and we can cover ourselves with those!
You're good at cooking.
So let's get going. We have a big day ahead of us.
Oh, apparently someone Kobato knows.
I did it!
Someone waiting for you?
There's a place...
Yes, we worked as poster Moconas!
You then complicated things when you said,
But, but... are you sure?
We have to go to the next world. Whenever this accessory shines.
Right?
I hope you get there.
They're all having so much fun.
Kobato really worked hard for this, didn't she?
What is it supposed to be?
Me?
Tonde yukeru wake janai shi
Do... Ba... To...
Where is it?
Yes ma'am!
Well then Kobato, I must be getting back to the kindergarten.
Oh, yes! Thank you very much.
This is it!
Ioryogi-san?
Huh? Huh?
Where could he have disappeared to?
Sorry!
I'm fine. I'm more worried about him.
Kobato.
So you're going to keep this up?
Hey! Katsuragi!
Good morning!
Yes, well I went back to the cake shop to apologize for having lost his umbrella
Don't worry about it.
He's almost like Fujimoto.
Oh no! If I'm late, he'll be mean again!
I-I'm sorry.
Kobato, do you have an umbrella?
I'm busy after this.
How do you do, I'm Chiho, the apartment manager's daughter.
We heard you didn't have any bedding.
Is it not possible?
I'm asking you.
You'd be disappointing that other girl, now wouldn't you?
Get in.
Uh!
Quit complaining.
It went pretty well this time.
Are you serious?!
Is because he
Since we're together
But when will "someday" come?
And start crying
Who, me?
Please wait a little while longer.
Unless you want to show the kids their kindergarten being torn down
Why are you hung up on this place anyway?
That might settle things more quickly.
I'll close down the kindergarten.
What do you plan to do, once you find that out?
What you're doing is intimidation.
I owe her one.
Let's go look, let's go look
I truly appreciate your thoughts.
To me, he seemed very lonely.
I think Sayaka feels the same way about him too.
because you care for each other that misunderstandings occur.
Maybe if I follow him, he'll lead me to Mr. Okiura.
Let me see him, please! Let me see Mr. Okiura!
Ioryogi-san, do you feel cold?
How long do you plan to wait here?
Then everything's settled.
I came here to ask you about something else.
We were all happy there.
Basically, we were from different worlds.
Are you okay with that?!
Oh good, you've come to.
And I can't fly to cover the distance
I now realize that's what these wings are for
Dou sureba iin dakke?
Na no ni
1 2 3! No aizu de ryoute hirogete
Good morning, Kobato.
I'm off work now.
Yeah. See you.
Let's take the ones that have been bound out front.
He's busy with work, isn't he?
That's how I feel.
No.
Fujimoto?
I'm not really sure, but...
and it was a good thing for Ms. Sayaka.
Yes I am.
Okay, stop!
He is not cold!
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry.
It's just that Mr. Okiura asked me to give him a message. Thanking him and stuff.
Okay, begin!
You're a great help, Fujimoto.
Not anymore.
Tch!
Please don't push yourself.
I did tell you that day we first met at Yomogi Kindergarten, didn't I?
Semete tsutsumitai
he'll go out and push himself too hard again.
Are always such a challenge
I found this, so I'll put it up here for you, okay?
Where are you headed to today?
I've told you time and again. If it's sympa...
It's not sympathy or curiosity.
Fun for you, perhaps.
They just need time, like anyone else.
Then we'll never get back, no matter how long you try!
No matter how long?
Right.
What's the big idea?
I can't relax with you following me around wherever I go.
We've got to get as many kompeito as we can!
Good afternoon.
Kobato has made her decision, hasn't she?
Or could you say the same for residents of Ikai?
Why?
I don't care about it.
Yes.
But he's actually very nice.
You made your decision as well, didn't you?
If you can't fill the bottle with kompeito, you...
Do you not care about what happens to you?
Are you a fool, or what?
Yes.
What is it, Ioryogi-san?
What?!
I presumed you already heard.
No, just that she would be in touch when she settled down.
I'm sorry, Kobato.
You're scolding me right to the last moment.
But thanks to a contract with a particular big shot,
However...
Kobato chose to spend her remaining time with you, rather than fulfill the terms of her contract.
And therefore, the contract... was nullified.
You have been...
Kompeito?
The kompeito...
Kizuku no, sono tame no tsubasa to
Muzukashii na
Machikirenai yo
Seiippai hashitte
I'm sorry.
Just...
Huh?
Domoto and his big mouth.
All right! A picnic!
Sure. Let's all go together.
Mr. Fukita, who's he?
You are very precious to me.
The piano...
Yes, of course.
Yes. Thank you for your help.
Kobato?
Inori wo sasageyou I offer you my prayers
They're very good, your baumkuchen cakes.
Well done.
Yorokobi, kanashimi, In happiness and in sadness,
When this bottle is filled, my wish will come true and I'll finally be able to go there.
Just getting that bottle is nothing.
Yes!
Don't suddenly jump off the see-saw!
Is there anyone here with a wounded heart?
Excuse me! Is there anything I can do to heal you?
How does being "it" heal anyone?
then there's no sad person with a wounded heart! That's a good thing!
Jeez, you put a positive spin on everything.
What a wonderful person you are!
Huh?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
Yes...
Would it help you?
Yeah...
We don't care about his name!
You can dance?
Hey, Mr. Kiyokazu, come play the organ!
Fine. Go home.
But I'm helping out here!
Oh, are you two...
Oh.
Yes! Well, I had a stuffed animal with me.
Since he can't talk, I'll have to go get him or else I'll be in big trouble!
What?
I'm trying to find that out myself...
You'll just inconvenience us if you think that we're pitiful or overworked.
Cause trouble...
But I have to wait here a bit more because Mom's not home yet.
Aren't you gonna say that it's horrible?
Yes! She's a great mom.
Wait a minute!
Then... what should I call these?
Right!
Fine! No 100 after all!
No fair!
Morning.
See you later, Kobato.
Looks like Sayaka hasn't changed. She's always worrying about others.
Yes?
She looks really nice!
U-Umm...
This is all I have!
I don't own any!
I'm sorry!
I'm late!
Let's play!
Then we'll help you!
But it seems like everyone's excited to have her here.
What is it?
It was something I borrowed too...
Something wrong?
Plus, if you don't have an umbrella, you'll get your stuffed animal wet.
Mutsumi?
Hey!
Thanks a lot!
H-Have a nice day!
Morning!
You know, that boy from earlier is kind of mean.
You were a minute and 23 seconds late.
He can be a bit blunt, but he's not a bad person.
I don't.
Sharing an umbrella...?
Mutsumi looked really sad.
This is going to be a bit difficult...
Please, open the door!
Please!
I'm not dating that girl or anything.
She... forgot her umbrella, so I was just walking her home.
Mutsumi.
Hurry up.
Let's go!
Geez...
What's the matter, Kohaku?
You get a zero!
Kompeito in the bottle.
I hope you're not completely satisfied with one or two!
At this rate, it's going to take you a hundred years to fill the bottle.
Itsuka negai wa kanau to
Little birds are singing.
It's not like that!
Do pretty fresh leaves make you cry?
Do I know you?
My name is Kobato Hanato.
It's Ioryogi-san.
Hmmmm...
Yes!
Beats me. When I look at these leaves, my eyes water.
I'm trying to understand the reason behind Kohaku's tears.
When would be a good time to approach her?
Wha- Hey! No!
Heed to my calling.
No, we shouldn't have been trespassing. I'm sorry.
I mean, it has been on my mind and...
And then the tears come.
Oh apparently that's what they call it when you go somewhere
Second prize, a vacation at a hot springs resort!
Lottery ticket...
Amusement park tickets...
Congratulations! You are a winner!
You're delivering newspapers?
I work at a pizza place, too.
Hey.
Yes! So please.
But I really can't take them.
Shuichiro is a very busy man.
Stop imagining it!
Would that...
...be asking a favor?
Shuichiro.
I can't see Kohaku and Shuichiro.
So? Any more in the bottle?
But, but! It makes me feel good that she was happy.
"Arigatou," tte kimi ga waraeba
Ittari kitari ureshiku naru
Issho ni iru kara
E-Excuse me.
Maybe it's because these green leaves are beautiful?
The green leaves being beautiful makes people cry?
I don't think you get it...
By the way, may I ask for your name?
I'm Kohaku.
And you're Kobato.
No matter how hard I look at them, tears won't come out.
Sorry!
I'll heal her heart if she's hurt!
You could've just waited at home.
They're flirting like no tomorrow.
When should I go in?
Lend me your powers to enrich the soil.
Gather in order to help these lives.
O, Rain of blessing, fall upon the earth!
Kobato? Ioryogi?
I think to myself, "I wish Shuichiro could be here to see it too".
I get a tight feeling in my chest.
And I start feeling sad...
And?
But I don't have any...
G-Go ahead.
Amusement park tickets...
Congratulations! You won a prize!
Take good care of him!
But it'd be a waste to just throw them away...
I think you're as important to him as he is to you.
I'm sure he also wants to go on a date with you.
If it isn't filled by then...
Don't act so carefree! You only have one year!
Okay!
Didn't I tell you to start panicking?
You're always such a klutz.
What is it Marina?
It'd be nice if you could actually read the picture book!
If you'd like to, you could stay at my place!
If you're late, Fujimoto will yell at you again.
Is there something you need?
Police! Help! There are scary people here! Hurry!
Toshihiko! Are you all right?
What's he doing?
But then, why did he say not to read this book?
That was supposedly the last book he wrote.
His... last book.
On the bank of a beautiful stream lived a single firefly.
And so, she taught the sad firefly how to glow.
In the end, by the banks of the stream, the two of them lived and glowed - together.
But he's still not here, huh.
You promised, didn't you?
I don't have time.
It was a while after the book was published...
...I?
Are you okay?
Naoko... stood here and drew this.
I was able to help Mr. Mori.
79 points.
Does everyone have everything?
Did you all remember to bring your lunches and water bottles? Snacks?
Yes!
Right!
Kobato?
Yes, there is. Could you pass on a message for me?
It seems like I've accused you of something you didn't do...
But unfortunately, you don't have a job anymore.
No!
Him, huh.
You'll be turned into some tiny one inch tall doll next time.
What is it?
Ah. It's done.
Let's play a game!
Where is everybody?
She's looking in a strange place again.
Huh?
Coming!
Masao, I've got you too!
Marina!
Marina!
No, the four leaf clover.
The view over here is nice. Let's take the picture here.
Kobato, look it, look it!
I forgot.
Huh? Ioryogi hasn't come back yet...
Who's in trouble?
Baumkuchen.
A good luck clover.
If things keep going like this, sooner or later, Yomogi Nursery is going to get shut down.
There we go.
It's not like they need to be new to work well.
Why do you keep tripping when there's nothing to trip over?
Huh?
It'll be fine if you just apologize to him, Kobato.
He's not here.
Report?
Something you want to do...
Domoto! Do us a favor!
That guy just doesn't get along with people. He's kinda scary.
That's not true.
I'm sorry. Neither Fujimoto nor Kobato are here today, you guys must be bored.
Sayaka, where are Kiyokazu and Kobato?
Fujimoto? He just left.
Please, Professor Tomita. If there's anything you could do.
You're amazing.
At what?
Definitely! I wish I could help everyone, but I just can't seem to get the hang of it...
Then Chiho's it! Come on everybody, let's go hide!
R-Right...?
I got you, Yukari!
This is something that might help you out if you're thinking of getting a loan.
Fine! Forget it!
If I didn't, they'd just keep asking.
Doesn't matter. Your business, take care of yourself.
I've known Kiyokazu for much longer than you have,
Like how you're so nice.
If I really wanted to help them out, I should refuse like Kiyokazu does.
I guess attractive guys have attractive guy worries as well.
Kobato! 30 points!
Kobato! Mr. Kiyokazu's not angry anymore, right?
He made a bamboo-copter for me!
He's probably hungry.
Huh?
Is it okay if we go to your room, Kobato?
It looks like he likes it.
Um... Why are you two talking so quietly?
Do you think you could bring him back to his owner?
The kitty was just in a box by himself and I didn't see the owner's name anywhere.
Are you okay?
Then can you take responsibility yourself?
Yes.
You're causing me trouble too.
We'll help you look!
We'll definitely find someone for you, Milk!
Milk!
Wow, so cute!
Oh, that's...
There must've been some sort of circumstance...
All right. If anything comes up, here's my cell phone number. Give me a call, okay?
Yes!
There, there.
Bye bye, Milk!
Please?
The resonating sound of the wind.
See you.
It's give-and-take. That's how the world works.
You noticed how upset Chiho and Chise were about having to give up the cat,
That isn't something to be happy about!!
That's right! Summer means...
A summer festival.
That's right, it's already time for summer festivals, isn't it?
Keep messing around and you're going to be late.
He's a bully today too.
If you don't stop with the cell phone, I'll have to confiscate it!
You really are a natural at it!
Are you a student here?
No I'm not. I'm Kobato Hanato from Yomogi Nursery!
It's fine, just go!
I don't even know what's on her mind anymore...
Thank you. It looks like we'll make it on time for the festival.
Yesterday?
And I'm really close with the girls in the Photography Club too.
We always have so much to talk about!
Matching phones!
I'll treasure it.
Okay!
Hey!
Yeah.
I bought a single lens reflex camera.
Yeah, you were finally able to buy your dream camera!
Yeah, totally!
Even though you're an amateur with no talent, you pretend you're a pro. You're pathetic!
Yukino!
It's gone.
The charm is gone.
I'll help you look!
At any rate, l'll help you search.
Natsuki...
It was me who grew distant from her first.
We've fought so many times I can't even count them anymore!
We're not here for you to heal yourself at summer festivals!
You've been energetic all morning even though it's terribly hot.
Ioryogi! Are you okay?
What if...
Kobato, do you really understand?
Why you're here.
Kobato?
I can't imagine that...
I think it's already been fourteen years since then...
Kiyokazu, this is my daughter, Sayaka.
Camera, camera, where is it...
I even introduced him to the children.
Even at school, it didn't seem like Fujimoto had any friends.
Try some for free today!
Come now, no fighting.
Okay!
Hey! What do you guys think you're doing?
Don't you think playing like that is dangerous?
Everyone planted the sunflowers here together and took really good care of them.
Apologize to this girl, to everyone, and then leave!
Then you shouldn't have passed me the ball there!
It's okay. It just got a little hurt.
Run, run, with your friends by your side.
D-Did I say something strange?
come back over and play.
You managed to air me out too!
Yup! I still have one for Shuichiro in the fridge.
Isn't that great, Ioryogi?
This is about all I can do for Shuichiro.
Me too! If I can help out Yomogi Nursery, it makes me really happy.
Me too!
What should I do...
I'm sorry!
Well then...
Oh... well then...
Thank you so much!
Actually, there's something else I wanted to ask you...
It's nice to formally meet you. I'm the manager, Ueda.
And now, what should I do to help?
I'll be working the register, so when the customer pays, make sure you say...
Now, put those in a box, Kobato.
Okay.
And now a Mont Blanc and...
I got it!
It must've been switched by accident...
Y-Yes...
Okay!
He looks like a stuffed animal to everyone right now.
Yumi, you can go home now too.
Thank you, and good night!
This is really good.
I'll find out what's bothering the manager!
Could you just casually ask him what's the matter then?
You've just been kinda strange lately!
It's been a while since I've gotten anything from Tirol.
But I've never seen him before.
Miss Sayaka seemed very lonely...
People don't just go about telling others everything.
But Yumi really wants to know...
What are you doing?
Has there been some sort of incident?
The manager?
Would you happen to know anything about this?
Tirol's cakes are very popular,
Yumi, this is the part where we tail him!
I wonder if he's waiting for someone.
Yumi?
Time off?
I've been learning how to make cakes. That's why I have so many injuries.
Do you mind if I try it?
Yes! Detective Kobato, case closed!
The manager wanted to make sure Yumi had time off to rest...
What?
I'll work hard too, so you try to rest a little and go to college.
You only get 50 points because you're a meanie!
Iorogi.
Good morning!
Yum, yum!
Baumkuchen, bakey, bakey.
Huh?
How annoying.
What's all this about now?
The only ones not conscious of the existence of these separate worlds
In each of these worlds, nonaggression is the fundamental rule.
What does Iorogi have to do in order to be able to return to the spirit world?
Until that girl's wish is granted, Iorogi is stuck in that form and can't return to the spirit world.
Just leave him be for a while, why don't you?
Jeez.
A seminar. For college.
Yup.
But...
I did try to stop them, but it just devolved into a fist fight.
There's no choice but to let them resolve it themselves.
I've become fond of having my name pronounced like that.
I told you I have something I need to do, didn't I?
Darn you, my stuffing's coming out here!
so I didn't call out to him.
Thank you so much!
Fujimoto!
Ioryogi!
Yes! Ioryogi and I have always been together!
I'm sorry...
What?
Not at all!
Hey, stop that!
It's the smell of fall!
And to make that wish come true, what do you have to do?
Kobato.
Yes?
Yeah. They're old and dirty, we might as well just throw them away.
Huh? Ioryogi?
Are you an idiot?!
It's for you, Miss Sayaka.
Can you two promise to treat them well from now on?
It's dangerous.
Even though it's so beautiful and magnificent...
What's redevelopment?
What did you say?
Were you also worried about this ginkgo tree?
Is that so?
I have no idea what's going to be okay.
It's a magnificent ginkgo tree,
What's the matter, Kobato?
It says thank you.
And also...
be1Each time night falls, let us offer up a prayer
Why were you just standing there looking confused?!
Sooner or later, it was going to wither and die.
Even plants and trees have souls, don't they?
If you heal that soul, then it's not so strange that this would happen.
Let's play leaf pictures together!
Where is it?
Kobato fell down again!
Mhm. Good luck with that.
Yes ma'am!
I sort of recall something wonderful happening on pitch dark nights like tonight.
I'm asking you to quit reading that book.
He seems totally different now.
I wonder if he's got something troubling him.
Do you not have a place to live?!
Um...
If you're late, Fujimoto will be on your case again!
Damn you!
What's she?
Good thinking!
That book you had yesterday.
I'm practicing but I'm not getting much better at reading it.
I don't know.
I did hear that he hasn't written a book since.
But seeing the sad expression on Firefly's face, the little girl firefly taught him how to shine.
Ever since, the two spent days and nights shining together by the riverside.
Hey, now what are you up to?
You've improved.
"Come and see the fireflies with me. I'll be waiting at Hachiman-yama, by the stream."
What?
Remember? We promised.
Very well. I understand. Remember? We promised.
Please don't say that.
I'm telling you, I don't have time.
"They were very beautiful."
And yet I...
Naoko was standing right here when she drew this.
Right here.
So this time, I would like to give you the entire one hundred points, but...
Then, in that case...
But they let gravity trick them
I bet the reason that child looks so terribly sad
And you laugh and reply, "Thank you"
Thank you!
Kobato, your back is covered in dirt.
We'll help you.
Really?
There's so much smoke!
I'll... do my best!
What?
Wait up!
Let go of me, you thief!
No! No, don't!
Running away from home?
Potato Thief is fine.
I'm not a Potato Thief!
That's called forgetting.
What a big dog!
Is that so?
I need to save up.
It's locked, isn't it?
Please!
Because... well, Grandpa's there.
Yeah.
In the morning, he always yells at me really loudly to get up.
Grandpa, what are you doing?!
Keita!
That's why I don't want to... go to that house...
Miss Sayaka is a kind teacher at Yomogi Nursery who loves all of the children there very much.
Keita.
I apologized to the lady at the farm for you.
Huh?
Good evening!
I've got something I need to do, so I'll be going ahead.
I suppose that's true...
They'll probably be annoyed, actually.
There's no way to undo what you did!
That wasn't a joke!
There's no way you could be fine after collapsing like that!
it won't be long before her condition is much worse than just collapsing.
Yeah!
in the valley...
A balloon?
Right now, there's something more important...
I got it.
Hurry up and get going.
What she said was right.
Hey, Kobato.
Okay.
What's the answer to number seven?
Oh no! You don't know either, Chise?
Huh?
We see, we see.
You know, the thing that Mama always makes for us when we get sick!
Easy to digest?
In that case, why don't you make some rice porridge for her?
And kind of gooey!
G-o-o-e-y!
D-r-e-n-c-h!
Some do!
I was the one who did just about everything.
Staring at them like that won't create more konpeito.
Hm?
something heavy that had been twisted up inside of me seemed to come loose and...
Good morning.
Are you all better now, Miss Sayaka?
Yes. You see, their school had a bazaar today.
Oh...
Let's do it, let's have a bazaar!
Kobato, you see
Let's do our best! Yay!
See you tomorrow, goodbye!
Yes!
I'm not.
It's impossible for both Fujimoto and that other guy to just be straightforward about things.
It's a mystery.
That's mean!
I wonder if they'll sell...
They will!
Really?
Congratulations!
That man...
Hm?
It's obvious, isn't it?!
I'll do my best in order to help make the bazaar successful!
You see those?
Hello!
Right?
Would you like some yakisoba?
Mommy!
Don't "what happened" me! You can't tell just by looking at me?
It's okay.
So I said.
Maybe I'll go to that bear's place and eat a ton of baumkuchen...
Got it!
Ah, so part-time help then?
Looking at how well you guys fit into your roles now,
Right now, there's nothing else for us to do but bake baumkuchen
Well anyway, absolutely do not, on any account, start any trouble!
W-What?
I wonder where I could get some salty food...
Whatever, come on!
Hey, cut it out!
With that being said, crank up the enjoyment meter to max!
I apologize!
Hey, wait a second!
Huh? Where is this?
This time I'll definitely...
Dang it... at this rate, I'm just gonna get more and more fired up!
As if I could stand being some kid's plaything.
Huh? It's not here. I can't find it!
Huh?
Welcome back, Kobato!
You're quite welcome.
Really?
Don't "was it really" me!
You said so yourself, Ioryogi. "'I'll bring something that'll sell really well."
It's freezing.
If you don't hurry up, you'll end up not being able to go anywhere!
Really? At my place, brother
Let's go home for today, okay?
I don't blame the parents for being worried.
Of course that's not okay!
You really helped us out though.
I like this one! I wanna hang it up!
I'm fine, really.
Miss Sayaka... looked very lonely.
But his presence causes trouble for everyone, doesn't it?
I'm sure that if I just explained things to him, he'd understand!
Please don't destroy Yomogi Nursery! I beg you!
But!
He collapsed all of a sudden!
The ambulance went bee-boo-bee-boo, didn't it?
Yes, this is Yomogi Nursery.
Kobato.
Then shall we get going?
Um... that person is fine. They said he'll get better soon.
Yes, what is it?
Are you going home now?
Oh yeah. If there's anything else you need for the Christmas party, let me know.
All right.
Yeah.
I-I'm sorry!
I'm fine.
Oh, nothing!
See you later.
He might not be able to say things so straight out.
Konpeito! A bottle full of them!
Kiyokazu... became an orphan on Christmas Eve.
All right then, let's all call for Santa Claus!
That person is Santa Claus!
I've finally realized what the perfect present is for you.
Thank you very much.
What?
Don't get the wrong idea.
But she thinks it's her fault, and she said she wants to apologize to you.
I said that from the beginning, didn't I?!
This is from Domoto.
What did Domoto say to you to make you wait here?
The flowers that bloom in springtime,
The resonating sound of the wind.
But I'm...
That's because it's almost Valentine's Day.
To the person they like...
So you're saying that in exchange for helping out at Tirol,
It's really busy at work, so it might be hard for me to help out at Tirol...
Ioryogi?
Mokona, it's all right for you to speak.
Three people and one Mokona!
Which means that... Ioryogi, you would be one Ioryogi!
You do.
Yeah, really.
The money we have now probably won't work here.
It's okay! I have a room!
I take that back. That idiot probably isn't thinking of anything.
You were sleeping so soundly!
But Ioryogi, you're jealous of Mokona's cuteness!
Are you sure? Is this okay?
Wow, that's such a pretty glow!
People from other worlds can't do more than simply watch over her,
I hope that their next world will be the one where their precious person is waiting.
And not just chocolate... she gave me money too.
Um...
Fujimoto's really busy with his work, isn't he?
Um, some of your belongings are still
But...
Well, he's gone now. I think I'm going to go out for a bit too.
Teach, you have any luggage left?
It seems like there's a lot of stuff going on above us too.
We grunts wouldn't understand though, I guess.
Don't worry about it! He'll be just fine.
I see. Thank you.
That's impossible.
Thanks for the food!
Who's the one who's going to get hurt?
Kobato, I have a favor to ask of you... is that all right?
That's not my place.
It's telling you that you have until the next full moon to gather the rest of the konpeito.
I wonder.
If that battle hadn't happened, that girl wouldn't have...
Don't do things without asking first!
To work.
Because your right here, Fujimoto, is always all scrunched up!
Hey!
I'll do my best to row!
Don't put the oars in too deep.
Use your legs too.
To Kobato?
It's natural to be concerned about those important to you.
Ioryogi is that stuffed animal you're always carrying around, right?
I don't know.
Okay.
Stop! Please stop!
Mama told us to come clean up the futon.
How come?
Okiura said that this time, he'd do everything he could to help out.
Huh? Y-Yeah...
You're such a bully...
I'll do my best!
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
Why...
Excuse me!
Then she's now... already at that place?
Good luck with everything.
You don't need to do this now, but make sure you take a look at the file on my desk.
It's supposedly about property inheritance.
It's been just about four years since he came to work at my firm.
Fujimoto, it's the courthouse clerk.
It's about the client who passed away a few days ago.
It's very nice to meet you.
You're very good at it!
Huh?
And lastly... could you sing that song for me one more time?
If I were able to meet that person once again,
Baumkuchen is delicious, isn't it?
Ureshii toki waratte
Meippai kizu tsuite
Seiippai hashitte
Could be fun.
Y-Yes!
Oh! I made a mistake! Yomogi Kindergarten!
Where's Sayaka? I'd like to speak to her.
No way...
They'll reduce you to the size of a thumb doll!
Well, we'll leave that aside for now.
I need you to look into something for me.
Marina! It's time for lunch!
Oh, well...
Right.
you used to brag about?
Oh, it's done.
Watch your words!
Three!
Okay! Kobato is ready!
There they are!
Ms. Sayaka, please stay here with the others.
Marina! Marina!
Marina!
Marina!
What a relief.
You mean with hide-and-seek?
I'm sorry.
Fujimoto! Hurry!
They're all over!
Oh no!
Hey! Good on him!
I want everybody to stay happy, forever.
Looks like a real bad bunch who tricked him.
Juuryoku ni damasareterunda
Sore nara
"Arigatou," tte kimi ni ietara
"Arigatou," tte kimi ga waraeba

It starts here, doesn't it?
I have to pass a test to see if I can live here or not!
That's right.
The test already began.
And I'm your proctor.
Y-Yes, I did.
Ioryogi?
Hurry up and throw it away or they'll pick you clean.
The crows have their eyes on...
Let's go.
Isn't this great, Ioryogi?
Hey, you're asking for it!
She already has a guy!
I gotta say, something here smells really nice.
I'll pay you back by helping you!
Then you see...
Yeah, it does!
Now I wanna try it too...
I'll try my best!
Wow...
It seems like he stopped crying.
There's a stage over there! Let's go!
You failed!
Good evening to you too, little songstress.
I'm really sorry for leaving without saying thank you.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Good night.
It's real, right?
Listen up, you start here.
Kobato Hanato!
Yes!
Why can't stuffed animals speak?
When we play kick the can, you can be "it"!
Nobody's heart would be healed by that.
Really?
Here you go!
Wonderful tissues right here!
I'm sorry!
That's a weird name!
Miss Kobato!
He's such a bully!
But I won't give up!
We have to do our best!
Miss Sayaka!
I'm
Don't be!
Of course, there was nothing I could do to heal anyone...
And?
But I have to wait here a bit more because Mom's not home yet.
But...
Really! She's a great mom!
That's wonderful.
It's wonderful that you have such a great and hardworking mom.
Toshihiko?
I-It's okay if you get dirty.
I'm all wet now!
U-Umm...
Huh?
I'm sorry!
Hey.
Y-Yes?
I totally forgot!
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?!
There!
Let's see...
Don't be mean to her, okay?
Please use it.
Right!
No luck...
Of course not!
Good morning!
Ioryogi?
I'm Kobato Hanato!
It looks fine.
Morning, Kobato.
I've been seeing you everywhere!
Yeah!
Fencing practice is really intense, and it leaves me hungry afterwards.
Of course.
Mutsumi looked really sad.
Who knows.
It's a hand-me-down, if you don't mind...
Huh?
Please!
I want you to share an umbrella with Mutsumi too!
I just wanted you to cheer up...
Please!
I'm not dating that girl or anything.
Let's go!
It's fine.
I just felt something...
Did you see that?
The green leaves being beautiful makes people cry?
I'm Kohaku.
Kohaku as in Kohaku from heaven?
All right. Ioryogi it is.
Please tell me why!
Just watch me clean it up in the blink of an eye!
You're so clumsy.
Kobato!
Thank you!
What are you doing?
I expected that.
Hold it!
Third wheel?
If you barge in now, you'll just get in their way.
Wait, what are you doing here?
I'm sorry for not being able to keep my promise today.
I'm sorry for trailing you.
Well, it's more because Shuichiro is always really busy
Leave it to me, Kohaku!
Here!
Fujimoto?
Yeah right.
Here.
Thank you very much.
I'm sure he also wants to go on a date with you.
Shuichiro?
100?
Didn't I tell you to start panicking?
You're getting the wrong idea again!
Thanks!
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to soon!
And so, he came to forget the fact that he was a firefly at all.
I suppose.
Thanks to Miss Sayaka and Miss Chitose, I have fluffy bedsheets to sleep on now!
We came to get our money back.
Money?
Who do you think you are, giving orders!
The one at fault is the one who can't pay back her loans, isn't it teach?
Y'know, if you just returned what you owed us, we'd leave.
Which is why I'm telling you to just hurry the hell up and pay!
I don't have time to play with children!
Everyone really likes this story.
You met Mr. Mori?
On the bank of a beautiful stream lived a single firefly.
In the end, by the banks of the stream, the two of them lived and glowed - together.
I'm going to find it!
The firefly remembered.
You've gotten good at reading that, haven't you?
Um, the fireflies haven't come out yet.
My... ex-girlfriend.
Hello?
This is...
Naoko... stood here and drew this.
That old man was healed.
Right!
Someone who's been allowed to work here!
Is Sayaka there? I'd like to speak to her...
You're an interesting one.
But he seemed like a scary person, and...
Sorry, we'll be right there.
He even decided that stuff for you?
Now I have a boo-boo.
And your look is how many times more pathetic than mine?
I can't believe you asked me to do that.
Kobato! Marina!
Yay! Kobato's it!
Kobato looks like she's having fun.
She's looking in a strange place again.
Everybody, it's time to go!
Toshihiko and Yoshio, I found you!
Ah... she did!
She found us!
And over there! And there!
Marina!
Marina!
I wanted to give it to you.
Kobato, look it, look it!
Okay!
You're one of the workers at that bear's place, aren't you?
Here you go!
Reporting!
Apparently the previous head of Yomogi Nursery was tricked and forced to borrow a lot of money.
Oh no, did that one break too?
I'm asking you what it is you wanted to ask me.
Really! Don't be sad!
You did get directions before leaving, didn't you?
Well, it's a college. Makes sense that it would have this many people.
Sorry! Are you all right?
Yes...
No! I mean... I'm not really his friend.
I'm Takashi Domoto. And you?
I came to bring that to Fujimoto.
No, no, not at all! That would help me out a lot!
Fujimoto's always so busy.
But that's just like Kiyokazu.
Doesn't it suck that it's due next week?
I got it, I got it. I'll help.
Just to let you know, I'll help, but you'll be doing the work.
Everyone's waiting! Hurry up and come play.
Thank you!
I see. Thank you. I'll look around.
Have you spoken to him yourself?
If someone he likes, like you, could put in a good word for me first...
Really? I owe you!
You're amazing!
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot!
Then Chiho's it! Come on everybody, let's go hide!
Sayaka, will you take a look at this?
And this one's from an accountant friend of mine.
Thank you.
What?!
Doesn't matter. Your business, take care of yourself.
I just felt jealous.
Is it bad to try and help people?
You too. See you later.
Because you acknowledged that attractive guy's kindness.
Was there anyone else?
I guess attractive guys have attractive guy worries as well.
By the way, Dobato.
I said you were helpful.
Please take him home with you.
Now you're taking in abandoned cats?
Same thing.
Bully.
Mama's out right now.
So cute!
Um... Why are you two talking so quietly?
I don't know.
I see.
But sooner or later, the kitty will homeless again!
And if he's at Yomogi Nursery, we could go visit him any time!
Milk! Here kitty!
Looks like everyone likes him.
I'm okay, really.
Stop it!
No, no, I'm sorry as well.
I think he might've been projecting himself onto that kitten...
I'm sure we'll be able to find someone!
I'm sorry, I've already got my hands full taking care of all of the children...
I live by myself so I can't think of anyone off the top of my head, but I'll ask around too.
I feel like I'm causing trouble for everyone...
All right. If anything comes up, here's my cell phone number. Give me a call, okay?
Milk?
Yes!
He's so little and adorable.
There, there.
We'll come visit you!
Milk's milk bowl.
I tried to comfort him too, but...
Um...
What are you doing?!
Kobato?
What's up?
Yes! Fujimoto found someone for us.
I'm sorry for bothering you with all of this.
Fujimoto found a new owner for Milk... I wasn't able to do anything.
and you sang for them.
I only wanted to tell them about the baby and his grandma...
But...
It's so pretty!
You get what I'm saying, right?
Wait just a second.
But...
Yomogi Nursery is on break today.
Are you all right?
Kobato!
My body feels really heavy...
No I'm not!
It's a high class ladies' school that's not fit for you.
He's a bully today too.
S-Sorry.
You really are a natural at it!
Really?
Excuse me--
Annoying. Kobato, run!
Huh? Why?
Your name is Yukino, right?
I'm sorry it's a little wrinkled.
It's just like Fujimoto said...
That picture...
Before, we used to walk to school together every morning.
Yukino, you have terrible bed hair!
And I'm really close with the girls in the Photography Club too.
I'm going to get this one.
Cheese!
I bought a single lens reflex camera.
So a lot of people are mistaken about good photography.
Um... I think it's great that you were able to buy the camera you wanted so much!
What happened?
What should I do? I'm... I'm...
It was me who grew distant from her first.
Nat.
Miss Sayaka, Miss Chitose, you've never fought before?
But the two of you are still so close!
Nat! Smile!
We're not here for you to heal yourself at summer festivals!
Underneath the blue, blue sky,
You've been energetic all morning even though it's terribly hot.
What song is that?
You're too loud!
Can't you do anything without causing such a commotion?
Ioryogi! Are you okay?
What?
What if...
For now, I want to try and help Yomogi Nursery. Even if I can only help a little.
and now they're harassing Sayaka Okiura as well.
The futons?
I totally didn't notice.
But there are times he doesn't...
Sorry for the wait!
He's so little!
Fujimoto was a student here before?
Fujimoto was...
An orphan.
Even me. He was always by himself...
Delicious cold beer!
I'm sure they'll bloom beautifully since everyone's taking such good care of them.
The ball suddenly flew over and surprised her, that's why she fell!
Miss Sayaka!
Does it hurt anywhere? Are you okay?
I didn't think you'd actually fall.
Damn... Why is it so wet here?
You just hit her with the ball!
We did not.
It's okay. It just got a little hurt.
PIzza delivery, bicycle repair, newspaper delivery... and more.
I feel that way too.
Miss Sayaka showed me pictures today!
I want to see!
I want to see little Fujimoto too.
Not you too, Chitose!
What should I do...
Good morning, Kobato!
Who trips where there's nothing to trip over?
Fujimoto.
Do you want to help? Or do you just want to get in my way?
What's up? You're awfully upbeat.
You mean you came all this way without even knowing that?!
What are you waiting for?
No, it was my fault. Sorry.
Me too.
But still! I think he gets mad too often!
I see.
If you see him, could you let him know I'm looking for him?
Ms. Sayaka!
We're all waiting for you!
N-No, it's not that!
Ms. Sayaka!
Right?
These are good!
You get along well with Professor Tomita, don't you?
I can't afford to drop this credit.
If you could just break the ice with one word...
Not at all.
Amazing? Why?
That sounds like Kobato.
Chise?
Forget it!
You purposely made her mad at you!
Um, since this spring.
You have a lot of wonderful features.
But, but! I didn't speak to you, just as you said!
Huh? Huh?
Right?!
Is because he
That exchange would fill you with joy
It would make you feel so happy
See you on Monday!
I'm sorry!
'Cause you wanna help pay back even just a little of the nursery's debt, right?
Right!
How about delivering pizza to people's houses?
I give up!
Sorry about this.
Yes. But when it gets busy here, it's hard for the manager to take care of everything himself...
Yup.
And a cream puff please.
It's okay, calm down. Get a different one.
What kind of cake would you like?
I got it!
Thank you, Kobato!
What's the matter?
Io...?
He looks like a stuffed animal to everyone right now.
Kobato, what kind of job are you gonna get next?
Could you line these cookies up on the shelf?
I'll go and ask what's bothering the manager.
Leave it to me!
Yes! I'll try my best!
I see.
It's been a while since I've gotten anything from Tirol.
Miss Sayaka seemed very lonely...
But Yumi really wants to know...
No, a detective acts alone!
Somehow, this has gotten completely off track.
Thank you very much.
Detective?
Is troubled?
See ya.
Thank you for today.
That's probably why he couldn't tell me about it.
and I was thinking that you got injured because of that...
I've been learning how to make cakes. That's why I have so many injuries.
I wanted to help you out, even just a little, so I've been studying...
It's delicious.
Really?
What, you actually managed to solve things?
And before, you brought back a present, didn't you?
Uh, that's right! Your score for this time, Kobato!
What?
It's Kobato!
Yum, yum!
Even though we're in these forms now, we're both inhabitants of the spirit world.
What's all this about now?
and in the spirit world, there's us under the King of Spirits.
We got dragged in, but as the ringleader, he got the worst end of the deal.
Until that girl's wish is granted, Iorogi is stuck in that form and can't return to the spirit world.
But what I can say is that ever since Iorogi came to the human world...
Kiyokazu.
I can't deal with this piece of crap anymore!
The seasons are changing, one after another.
are now locked together in what seems to be an explosive situation!
I'll bet.
I-o-ryo-gi?
I've become fond of having my name pronounced like that.
I have no intention of listening to you when you're like that!
Kohaku!
What's the matter?
Ioryogi! Where are you?
Fujimoto!
Yes! Ioryogi and I have always been together!
I'm so grateful!
What were you doing?! Why did you let your bottle get stolen like that?!
Huh? Smell of fall?
Um... When it turns fall, the leaves make themselves pretty and do the dance of the wind
Yuzuru and Toshihiko were having a fight over the blocks...
No.
Like a castle or
Fujimoto! You can't!
Huh? Ioryogi?
But...
Kobato.
What is it?
Fujimoto's face wasn't an angry one... it was sad.
It'd be nice if we could gather some more new toys for them, but...
Amazing!
A giant tree!
There are leaves of all different shapes and colors, right?
Can you two promise to treat them well from now on?
There's something that needs to be said after a fight, right?
What?
Were you also worried about this ginkgo tree?
It's supposedly because of redevelopment.
must be so lonely.
She might be lazing around now, but Kohaku was once an angel after all.
Goodbye.
No, it'll be okay! I'll ask them not to cut you down!
Yes.
be1Like smiles...
Happy?
In the end, it was able to be carried off on your song, Kobato.
Ioryogi?
Sang?
"It was able to be carried off on your song."
Huh?
A building block, isn't it?
I'm so glad! Everyone's made up now.
...what?
So only dig up as many as you can carry, got it?
No, the lady's grandchild who lives here is already a high school student.
Then...
Are they done yet?
Thank you!
But... Oh, together is just better.
I want you to get to know the neighbors better too.
Yes!
He really is a bully. He always says I'm a hinderance...
But despite that, he never says don't come with me, does he?
Yes?
Milk, have you been doing well?
Wait up!
Let go of me, you thief!
I'll return them! I'll return them, okay?!
Running away from home?
Nothing to say this time, huh?
Oh, and also!
I want to go back to that house!
With only a postbox and a dog as leads, there's no way we could find it.
Which way is it? Right? Left?
I've been here before!
Is this okay?
I mean...
Fujimoto!
Don't break it...
I mean, he's a really big bully...
Is that... bullying?
Who's Miss Sayaka?
But if you look real closely, you might be able to tell.
I'll be fine, don't worry!
Are you guys going home now?
Something to do?
But then he was able to understand his Grandfather's feelings.
They'll probably be annoyed, actually.
What on earth are you apologizing for?
I'm fine, really.
Kobato?
Please help me! Miss Sayaka is!
U-Um...
Right.
What's the matter?
I suppose you're right...
It's difficult, isn't it...
So it's like that...
You're worrying about the wrong person, aren't you?
Yeah!
Don't you need money?
What about the children?
But then you showed up to help out...
If something does end up happening to me...
Why... would you...
Everyone would be so sad.
I'd be in trouble, wouldn't I?
I'm not a space case!
Okay.
What she said was right.
The kids all worked together to fold those.
She's such a good kid, isn't she?
Huh?
Chiho.
What's the answer to number seven?
Oh no! You don't know either, Chise?
Yes.
In that case, why don't you make some rice porridge for her?
I'm sure it'll help Miss Sayaka get better!
Yes! I'll make some rice porridge for Miss Sayaka!
Good idea, Chise!
Mama said you'll burn yourself if you're not careful when you eat i!
I was trying to make rice porridge...
but I can't get it right...
I was the one who did just about everything.
You haven't gotten any.
Are you all better now, Miss Sayaka?
Good morning, Kobato!
Kobato!
It's where everyone brings all sorts of things,
Kobato.
Mr. Doggy!
Thank you!
Really! What an adorable duck and sheep you have drawn here!
I wonder.
That's mean!
Weather fortune doll?
They will!
You know... my mommy...
I want to see you as a big sister everyday too!
I'm shutting down the Nursery.
Tell her that I came here today too, okay?
I wonder if he was serious about destroying the nursery...
I-I didn't ask him for his name...
I'm making it out of the cloth I got from Chitose!
You're gonna mass produce that mysterious lifeform?!
Thank you so much!
I won't!
I apologize...
Right?
Would you like some yakisoba?
When I looked around today, I noticed that all the posters had disappeared.
Even if it's just one more person, I still want them to come!
You feel the same way too, don't you, Fujimoto?
I wonder if there are any treasures to be found?
Welcome!
Where is she? Has she not come back yet?
q2See, there was this really energetic girl running around shouting "Yomogi Nursery Bazaar!"
Yeah!
Yomogi Nursery is having a bazaar!
Is there anyone else besides me with this form?
Ko-ba-!
I... I... I'm not napping!!
The customer who ordered three slices?
Is mine done yet?
Next time, let's increase the varieties! We can have chocolate, etc.
but we somehow managed to catch a good wave.
Doesn't matter.
Is that all you have to say? Then goodbye.
Oh, actually
The enemy was too terrible.
Now is a time for repentance!
You got it?
Oh no you don't. This is my dessert. There's no way you're getting this baumkuchen!
If I use that, I'll be dry in one go!
But I'm starving.
I'll get you whichever one you like.
Uh oh... it's on a collision course!
I was once feared as the legendary Ms. Bullet of the Hit the Target game.
Who the heck are you?!
Yeah, it definitely did! Everyone saw it, right?
Because no one came to the bazaar.
What's important is going through with your actions once you've decided upon them.
U-Uh, I'm sorry!
With this many customers, there aren't enough helping hands.
Look.
But you know, I really wanted to get something directly from you before I leave.
Oh, that's right! I made a stand too!
It... what is it?
What the hell did you do?!
How come, Ioryogi? Are you disappointed because of me? If so, I apologize!!
As if I need that!!
That's so mean, Ioryogi!
See what?
How was that? Did you feel just a bit warmer?
That was mean...
What is it, Ioryogi?
Spring!
You need to fill up this bottle with konpeito by spring.
Let him be.
I don't blame the parents for being worried.
Thank you, Domoto.
Tell her that when the deadline comes, I'm destroying the Nursery.
Why does he want to do something so terrible?
He's not someone you can deal with by words.
Listen up. Just stay out of this!
Domoto!
Snow!
Try saying that after you've paid back your debt.
I understand. That's why we'll pay it back, little by little!
There's no way he'd listen to you!
Right...
Are you okay?
But now, it's time to go to sleep.
That man who was standing in front of the Nursery collapsed because of appendicitis.
You get it, don't you?
We're back.
What are you gonna do about this?
Thank you very much.
Let's...
See you.
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry!
More importantly, you know what else you need to be worrying about, right?
Isn't it?
Huh?
Is something the matter?
Nothing in particular.
I'll be fine.
Oh, I got it!
Oh no, I'm late!
Hm?
All right... you two need to get going too.
Everyone's so happy because it's Christmas, but Fujimoto is still sad.
Mom!
Good, I'm glad.
He is, isn't he?
All right then, let's all call for Santa Claus!
That person is Santa Claus!
Okay!
Oh, Fujimoto, good job today!
I hope you had made up with him.
the endless skies of summer
Okay.
Yes?
Valentine's Day?
Let's do it! A Valentine's party here at Yomogi Nursery!
I'm sure they do in some places, but in Japan, Valentine's Day is a day for giving chocolate, is it not?
They said it's fine as long as we work for it!
The manager said that it'll be okay as long as I work there from today until Valentine's Day!
Hey!
Then you've come here as part of your travels?
You... don't have any money?
If you're in a pinch...
It's okay! I have a room!
Ah, but there are bigger people here too...
Thank you, Kobato.
The nursery's on break, but I need to be at Tirol this morning or else!
To... get ingredients for making chocolate on Valentine's Day, was it?
We're not alike!
I did it!
There's a place I want to go to.
We're back!
Thank you for letting us stay here.
I hope that their next world will be the one where their precious person is waiting.
Kobato, that's a funny looking shape!
There really isn't much time left.
Don't go sticking your nose into something you can't handle.
Let me care for her.
I'm going to do this.
But I can't leave her like that.
No way. The cat's owner can no longer care for her.
Oh.
Hello.
Sure.
Huh? Huh?
I don't know who that is.
Let me hold her!
Yuzuru.
I'm sorry, Kobato.
Ms. Sayaka.
So what do you expect to do now?
I will find someone who can look after Milk.
I cannot cause any more trouble!
I agree.
Is Milk here?
Milk. We'll be sure to find someone to take care of you.
So you need someone to take that kitten.
My friends all live alone, so I can't think of anyone off the top of my head,
No, really...
Ah, but next time I'll go to homes where I know the people.
Hmm... Well you know I handle food. I can't be having a cat around here.
Oh?
She must be hungry.
I can't do anything. I feel so ridiculous.
Oh my.
Really?!
And she isn't allergic to cats.
My... Yes indeed. Thank you.
Please take good care of Milk.
The cherry blossoms were beautiful.
I tried to cuddle the baby too.
Then I sang her a song.
Me too!
Can you sing it for us, Kobato?
Precious thoughts spread across in my heart
Your hand in my hand
Together, we are one and whole
May I borrow your phone?
Miss Sayaka and Ioryogi and Toshihiko and...
Who'd you give your best chocolate to?
Wait!
You might think you look real cool, trying to save everyone,
Mr. Okiura's dad.
That's why I said that you just don't get it!
Do you know what would happen if the president actually got serious about this?
But you know... Kobato, was it?
All the nurseries are completely filled up.
Chitose... I saw Mr. Okiura in front of the Nursery today.
misunderstandings happen.
It's that man!
Excuse me!
Even if you meet with him, nothing will change. Go home.
Mr. Okiura!
I don't have anything to say to you.
To Miss Sayaka, to me, to Fujimoto, to everyone at Yomogi Nursery...
I just can't imagine that you're a good person after all of that.
He painted himself as the bad guy in order to protect you.
Fujimoto, what are you
That's why you need to be with him.
Where is Mr. Okiura?
Are you okay with that?
Good morning, Kobato.
Thank you. To make something new, old things need to be thrown out.
Thank you.
The one to make the final decision was me.
And even if they were, you can just toss them all.
Fujimoto?
You're even making me depressed!
Yes.
Yeah. I'll be back by tonight though.
Miss Sayaka!
Okay.
No, you two, stop!
Hey!
You guys too, good luck.
Kobato!
If you're doing this out of sympathy or curiosity, stop it.
No, even just one more season is fine!
Are you helping him out today too?
Quit joking around. Why does she have to help me?
Let's go somewhere fun!
That's right. They went out together.
Row!
If you keep doing it, we're never going to get back!
We're moving!
Right, that's why I'll do my best!
Oh, look here!
Huh? Well, of course you have.
You can go and play it again whenever you'd like.
You chose as well, didn't you?
I could
Fujimoto.
If you don't gather the rest of the konpeito, you'll! i know you said not to use these but it looks really funny with just an !
A full, 100 point idiot.
No, I...
Of course you have!
Then why?!
Just pretending to be one.
I can't do it, can I... I wanted to leave with a smile on my face in the end...
Stop! Please stop!
The konpeito... are accumulating.
But the contract cannot be changed.
I must go to the place I should be at.
The contract to reach the place she wished to go to...
We're sorry.
Kiyokazu, is your arm okay?
Kiyokazu!
Nothing really.
I'm sorry about the Nursery.
Thank you.
Once everything's set up again, let's all go on an outing together, okay?
I want to go too!
Huh? Y-Yeah...
Yeah.
It's because we share the same soul.
With our souls as one, we will be called together again and again, as long as time continues.
I'm glad things worked out.
Thank you very much.
Right.
Hello, this is Fukita Law Firm.
Even though he's still young, he's very on top of things.
I understand.
It's very nice to meet you too.
From now on... till the end of time.
Huh?
Yes, Ioryogi-san!
Get to it!
This.
That surprised me.
What were you trying to do by calling out the crows?
Well treat you.
Take this please.
Youre so unpleasant.
Its probably a flower-viewing festival.
Miss, can you throw the ball?
Here it comes!
I am.
Please.
the nabe?
Dobatos is getting too conceited.
What?
But the nabe you made was delicious, and thats worth 40 points.
He wont stop crying.
Dont worry about it, Sayaka-sensei.
Please sing more!
Its good we could meet again.
Thank you so much for earlier this evening.
Im very sorry.
Yeah.
Right!
Yes! Im collecting peoples broken hearts, Ioryogi-san.
All right. It seems you understand.
Huh? Why is that?
I kicked the can!
What?
I really helped him, now I got all of these wonderful things!
Ill give you lots.
Let me thank you!
Sayaka-sensei, over here.
Yes
Oh!
Weird name.
What is it?
U-Um, is there anything I can help with?
Im sorry.
I just wanted to thank you.
Huh?
Im counting on you two.
A new preschool just opened, so fewer kids come here now.
Huh?
Im sorry!
I didnt know that.
So what?
The divorce was tough but she still makes breakfast for me.
Oh youre so clever and unselfish.
Really! Shes really great!
Really?
Eh!
Toshihiko-kun, youre too good.
I was nice? Me?
Yes!
Itll look like youre going to break their hearts if you put it that way.
That sounds like youre going to take them away.
Argh, what a pain!
Hey, Kobato!
Ah! No way!
Whew! That was close.
Huh?
Oh! Nice to meet you. Im Hanato Kobato.
Yes, thank you very much.
Here.
What should I do?
Good point
You can use this if you want to.
Um Ill bring it back once the rain stops.
Yes!
Ill hit you if you dont wait up.
Shell get wet, but she still lent me her umbrella.
You have a mark on your face from the tatami. Tatami are the bamboo mats on the floors of many Japanese houses and apartments.
Ah!
Huh?
You knew where my school is?
Ioryogi-san is thankful too.
Yes!
I have a tatami mark on my face.
M-My bad
Well, I have morning practice.
And Im Chise.
Thats right.
I suppose its impossible.
Its just that, I wanted to cheer up Mutsumi-san.
She forgot her umbrella, so we went home together. you are one jealous ghurl
But you healed her for that very purpose, didnt you?
Well, you healed her broken heart even if you didnt mean to.
You did good this time, so I think Ill give you high points.
A-Are you all right, Ioryogi-san?
The birds are singing.
Im sorry.
Yes!
Thank you so much.
Tomorrow, I will wake up early and try asking Kohaku-san one more time!
I knew this would happen.
Dont be rude.
Something youll never have.
Kobato-san?
Lets see
An amusement park date.
Tickets are 3000 yen?! Keeper: lol, Danish amusement park tickets are like 4-9000 yen
Third place, tickets to the amusement park!
Huh?
Its also natural to feel dejected no matter what you do.
A fortune ticket
A stuffed alligator animal. Give it lots of love!
Are you delivering these newspapers?
Just do what you want, why dont you.
Those newspapers
Yes! Please, take them.
Why is that?
M-Me?
But, I really think its impossible.
I cant see them.
Of course not! Lets go home.
If you cant do it
What does a relentless face look like? Keeper: orig line what kind of a face is relentless?
I can read!
I saw it!
Eh?
Being all alone is lonely, isnt it?
Huh?
Hm?
What?
but thanks to Sayaka-sensei and Chitose-san, I have a soft and fluffy futon to sleep on now.
The firefly saw a small but beautiful light, off in the distance. Keeper: orig line "The firefly found a beautiful, distant but small light."
What are you doing?
Keep your hands off the kids!
Fujimoto-san!
That hurts!
You shouldnt be taking this lightly.
Just because our boss is nice to you
Mr. Police Officer!
Awesome!
If they come again, Ill run them off!
But if I can help her pay the debt, I could heal Sayaka-senseis heart.
Its him.
Hes still there. Whats he doing?
This is
Could it be
I live here.
Who knows.
So long, that he eventually forgot there were other fireflies.
Are you free this evening?
The firefly remembered.
Youre getting better at this, arent you?
You came!
At that time, I was very busy.
She said she wanted to show it to me too.
Is there anything you want?
Fireflies.
Then, lets go together.
Its a promise.
The old man remembered how to sparkle.
look at this.
This time its a perfect 100 points or so Id like to say.
But I must be getting soft, for giving you 80 points after that. Maybe 50 would be better
Yes!
Everyones going on a field trip.
Ah, so thats why you seemed so happy today.
Hello! Hanato Kobato!
Are you the debt collector?
What?
Why did you have to rage like that?! And yet you talk, you idiot!
Im going to crush the school.
Dont give Sayaka-sensei extra things to worry about.
But anyway, to hear you ask something like that Keeper: orig line "But, to hear those words from you"
Long ago, the only thing youd say is research it!
Then to fulfill your expectations, Ill give you an extra large helping! Keeper: orig line "Then to go along with your wishes, Ill give you an extra large one."
Ah, theyre finished.
I dont want to hear that from a stuffed animal like you.
Nothing at all! Thats the truth!
Its okay. I know something good.
Yes!
Kobato-chan looks like shes having fun.
Huh?
It has to find the people who are hiding.
But its time
Kobato-chan, are you okay?
We were found!
Sayaka-sensei, please stay here with the kids.
There it is.
Look!
Therere so many.
And it was from Genko-sama too!
So? How was the field trip?
Now! Listen, Kobato!
Our... competition?
Watch out especially for summer festivals.
I make the most of getting hurt
I surprise myself
Here, use this.
Maybe I won't be going this year.
Stay still. I'm going to help you get fired up!
There she is! There will be an official announcement next term...
Yukino! You again?!
S-Sorry ma'am.
Oh what a hassle. Kobato, run!
Nothing beats the real thing.
I'm sorry for all the wrinkles.
This place really is out of my league.
Look at your hair, Yukino!
Sorry, Natsuki. You go ahead.
If you're interested in photography, why don't you join our club?
But I don't know if I can handle club activities.
That's very impressive, Yukino.
I'm going to get this one!
Want to swap?
I don't know. How should I know if even they can't figure it out?
Hey. Let's try taking some pictures as soon as we get back.
Natsuki...
That's right.
With your talent, Yukino, you'll be sure to get good shots.
But right now I just enjoy taking pictures. I love photography. That's all.
Um... well... I'm happy for you that you were able to buy that camera you like. Oh and...
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
I've looked there. I've looked everywhere. Over and over. It's gone!
Natsuki...
Thank you, Kobato!
I've kept mine all this time, too.
Hey! Did you hear what I said?!
Theres no reason to buy new ones.
Fujimoto-san?
Made him mad?
Of course it is!
Didnt you listen to the directions carefully?
Its a university, of course therell be many people.
Um
You walked aimlessly around the campus, of course we couldnt find him!
We dont know where to start on Professor Hayakawas report.
And suddenly we only have until next week. Isnt that terrible?
I get it, I get it. Okay.
Yay!
Hes not very sociable and hes kinda scary.
Kiyokazu has his reasons for being angry.
But I sort of gave him some advice on his future.
Everyones waiting.
You see
So we thought wed share with everyone.
Doumoto.
Yes.
Chiho-chans it!
Im not helping you out of pity.
Whats with that?
Why? If you dont want to help people, you should just say that.
Um, Im sorry.
How long have you known Kiyokazu?
Um, since this spring.
Huh?
I said some really rude things.
Eh? But listening to everyones requests and then using your power to help is kind.
I still think about others but the truth is,
Kiyokazu is not afraid of being hated. Hes a strong person.
Is it wrong to desire to do something for those who are in trouble?
Because I dont know anything, Im always making Ioryogi-san angry.
He can talk but Im not allowed to speak to him!
That stuffed animal is Ioryogi-san?
Nobody would believe in a talking stuffed animal or talking to a stuffed animal!
The Kittens Lullaby
Acting like you have no problems of your own to deal with.
Youre wrong! The owner said it can no longer be cared for!
Chiho-chan whats the answer to number five?
Oh!
Shhh!
I dont know the owner.
Tomorrow, Ill ask Sayaka-sensei at Yomogi Preschool!
Kobato-san? What would be good?
Uh um
So we can keep it here?
Come with me for a second.
Impulsive?
Fujimoto-kun!
Sayaka-sensei!
Yes.
I will not cause trouble for everyone!
Count me in.
Please be this kittens new owner!
Chiho-chan! Chise-chan!
Come here, Milk!
We just came from the preschool.
But I havent found anyone who will take it home.
I dont think anyone really wants to abandon such a cute little kitten.
But Fujimoto-san seemed really gloomy when he said that.
I should do what I can with all I have.
European Pastries flower Chiroru
Oh?
It has really gotten dark.
Its pathetic how I cant do anything.
Yes, Im sure she will let you keep it.
Yes!
Gabu Jougasaki
Pizza man?
Isnt that great, Milk?
Well then
And what a relief!
Oh!
The cherry blossoms were blooming ever so beautifully.
Awfscx300-
But I only made him cry even more!
Uh Kobato-chan? What happened?
Oh, but since its a circle, it looks like the moon!
Fine then! You like circles so much, all youre gonna get are zeros from now on!
I dont need to tell you that collecting confetti will be a constant struggle.
Summertime Memories.
Every year since I was a kid.
I have to get going.
High schools are still in session today.
Hurry it up before it gets dark!
There she is!
Damn it all. Kobato, run for it!
Oh
Yeah.
Nacchan!
I, Hanato Kobato, have come to return your hankerchief!
Huh? What about the pool cleaning?
Mizuhashi
so I was happy you did.
Sorry, Nacchan. Go ahead without me.
I want to help Natsuki-san!
Now Im completely hooked.
What about Natsuki-san?
Strap Corner
Then you should get better at taking pictures.
Who knows.
If youre looking for that
That sounds great!
Especially since you bought the camera of your dreams!
Please?
Okay.
The strap is gone!
May I ask what happened?
But I was the one who grew apart
bottom boxes left to right E-mail; Save; Menu
Yukino
The fireworks are beautiful!
OP
What kind of song is that anyway?
Everybody at Yomogi Preschool learned that song! Its very fun!
Ohh, that was terrifying!
Kobato-san?! What was that noise?
Since its such good weather, Im going to air out the futons!
Hey, Kobato, do you even get it?
Hmm, but
Yes. Okiura Sayakas father, but he died two years ago.
Ive come to air out everyones futon!
such a wonderful girl like you living there.
Has he been mean to you?
It is a child that doesnt have a mother, a father, or any family.
I want to know even more about Fujimoto-san when he was little!
He never spoke to anyone.
Thank you very much. Shuichiro-san will surely be pleased.
No, its my turn!
They will.
You see, a ball whooshed in, and Tomo-chan got scared and fell!
Uh, we lost a ball here.
High upon the mountaintop you can see everything.
Plus he says hell become an attorney.
He seems to stay up every night studying.
Thats the smell of the sun.
Yeah! Play it, play it!
Welcome back!
But, but I aired out the futons.
Yeah, and I was aired out along with them!
Of course. Shuichiro-sans share is in the refrigerator.
Im also very glad when I can do something useful for Yomogi Preschool.
Huh?
Im sorry!
Um, is there anything you need help with?
Ill invigorate myself delivering papers in the morning.
Its no problem.
Oh, I know you!
Thank you for your help that day!
Oh my, you two already know each other?
Im Hanato Kobato!
Are you all right?
Now, what do you expect me to do?
J-Just like that.
Then Ill have the lemon tart.
Why hello!
What kind of cake do you want?
Today were getting my birthday cake!
Im tired.
Io
Huh?
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Our boss?
Im going to go visit Chitose.
I thought Id buy her a treat.
Ah, its Kobato-san!
Wow, cool!
Detective?
Then there are inquests, gathering info, and trailing suspects!
Eh? Detective?
Yes!
You think Ill take you up on that?
Well, I guess Ill take my souvenir and my leave.
Our boss is so nice to everyone.
We cant keep following him anymore. But still
You dont know?
So you were worried about that?
Yumi-chan, did you?
Yes.
Well, I dont see a lot of good coming out of you working hard.
What a pathetic form
Iorogi.
Why does she carry that thing around with her?
Cook them, cook them.
Then what did you come here for?
She must heal the grieving hearts belonging to the humans.
Excuse me, whats a seminar?
A seminar class. At college.
Ah, so its for college learning!
Please go, Fujimoto-san!
Youve done enough for today. You have an important seminar this afternoon.
But
Fujimoto-kun.
Its still pretty hot out.
I hear what youre saying, but Im still a bird.
Huh? Thats it?
Or so I thought. But then they began exchanging blows.
He took him in and gave him his name.
Give back that bottle!
You son of a
Yes! Ioryogi-san!
Youre very welcome!
Fujimoto-san!
Thank you very much for finding Ioryogi-san!
Lost?
Dobato!
Thats amazing.
What the hell kind of fantasy story do you think this is?!
Kobato! What do you wish for?
I have until the end of the four seasons.
Good morning!
W-Whats wrong? You cant tell someone you hate them!
Fujimoto-san, you musnt!
Fujimoto-san didnt get angry, but he looked so sad.
What kind of picture can you make?
Thats good, they made up.
Yes, a smile! A smile!
Thats redevelopment?
What?
I see.
And also
farewell.
Itll be all right!
Ill ask them to not cut you down!
Looks like its not hoping for that.
But, but
Its hollow inside.
Yes, Im sure it was.
Were digging up potatoes at the nursery today!
How the hell are you supposed to dig potatoes with a butterfly net?!
Huh?
Whose child is he?
All right, we should wrap this up and get going soon.
Kobato-chan, will you be okay?
Are they ready yet?
Dont get in my way.
Were from Yomogi Preschool.
Thank you.
Its doing fine.
Potato thief.
Whats your name?
Potato Thief will do.
Why did you run away from home?
and shed take me to camps and amusement parks during her breaks
It is what it looks like.
Lets leave these in return.
Theyre good.
Please
Keita!
Shes the one who dug up too many, and now weve got a lot leftover.
Ow!
Um
Good evening.
And weve been giving them to the neighbors.
Yeah. Kiyokazu is a good guy.
Well, it must be because he understands how his grandfather really feels now.
Then Ill cancel that out and Fujimoto gets zero.
Then let's bring it back to 50 points!
Then 12.5 points!
Im making decorations with this pretty paper!
Of course you cant
You cant tell women they look tired.
Youll hurt their feelings.
U-Um, Sayaka-sensei.
Oh, origami, and so much of it!
There was even more, but
Im fine.
Please open up! Excuse me!
Kobato-san?
Whats wrong with Sayaka-sensei?
I see
Well then, take care.
That doctor.
Hey.
Look, an angelfish!
A balloon!
I wonder why I can't help thinking about Kobato-san.
We folded a thousand cranes, after all.
Manager, Ive got a request
Sorry for worrying you.
youll just give me more trouble if you end up losing sleep over this.
Yes.
She really is a good girl.
rightHow fun!!
Um, is Chitose-san here?
Now that I think about it, Shuichiro-san said that too
But how do I make it?
What are you doing?
I was trying to make porridge.
For crying out loud, how did you make that thing?
Like who?
I might eat too much.
Im glad I could help!
Good morning.
Sayaka-sensei, good morning!
TITLE: The Mysterious Lifeform.
If we were to actually run a bazaar and Kobato-chan saw how useless it was,
If youre too blunt, you come off as a bully.
Well, the idiot part is true.
Its good that Kobato-chan cheered up.
That person?
Sayaka-senseis husband?
Those are amazing teru teru bozus!
To tell you the truth, my mom said
Mom is on vacation starting this month,
It really got late, didnt it?
Yes.
The debt collector.
That was you on the phone?
When the deadline comes, Ill be taking down the preschool.
If you dont want anyone hurt, youd better vacate soon.
Fujimoto-san! Were you listening?
Who was it?
Just stay quiet about it.
Dont show your face to Sayaka-san!
His names Okiura, right?
Then that man is Sayaka-senseis husband?!
Then why is he trying to take down the preschool?
What have you been sewing?
Im sure itll get sunny.
Were selling drinks too.
You will.
No we dont.
Yeah!
I dont think anyone will come like this.
When I looked today, the posters were gone,
Kobato-chan?
So Ive come to take a peek.
Welcome!
Well, some energetic girl is going around,
Thank you so much!
Mom!
Ureshii toki waratte
I thought I was going to fall.
Hey Kobato. Do you know what you're doing?
I report! Regarding Yomogi Kindergarten!
The former principal was apparently tricked into borrowing money!
Please tell me more. I'd like to know more about Fujimoto's childhood.
All right.
And from that day on, Fujimoto was to live here.
He didn't seem to have any friends at school, either.
Me neither!
We're giving away free samples.
Why is it so wet here?
Do you realize how dangerous that is?!
And get out of the garden, now!
Huh?
So tomorrow, everybody gets to take a nap with the sun.
No. Not at all. It's wonderful, isn't it?
Hey! It's Fujimoto!
Yeah, it is!
I'm home!
I see red, I see red
I'm happy too, whenever I'm able to help Yomogi Kindergarten.
Ms. Sayaka showed me pictures of you today!
Not you too, Ms. Chisato!
Ano ko ga anna ni kanashisou na no wa
Kobato. 17 TL
Yeah right.
There was a time when I was doing a lot of part-time work too.
When I think about it now, we never really stood a chance of winning.
We picked the wrong opponent.
That was me.
Right?
And this guy would just be bird food!
And then after something salty, Ill have baumkuchen again.
Is there anything salty around?
Hey, stop it!
Hey!
This is pretty tough.
Drying machines are more intense than I thought.
It all looks so yummy!
Hey, wait!
Lets see
Demons!
I cant find it.
Yeah, we all saw it!
What happened?
So thats what happened.
So? The posters you put up were torn down,
Well, its such a small event, after all.
Dont feel so dejected just because people arent coming.
Welcome!
Look at all the customers. We need more help.
Thank you for taking the time to come here!
Yeah.
That?
Apologizing wont solve anything!
So cold
Did you see that, Ioryogi-san?
I havent taken a step inside.
Youve got no right to complain.
I understand.
Please tell Rikako-chan to stay well for me.
Rikako-chan is leaving the preschool.
Awesome!
Ill be fine.
Um
Fujimoto-kun and Kobato-chan are up on the roof.
If anyone else leaves, Sayaka-sensei will be sad!
Snow!
That sounds great.
so lets put them all around it!
What do you want?
Kobato-chan, even if you talk to this guy
Nothing.
nothing will change if you tell me all that.
Then Ill speak with Okiura-san.
Im leaving for today.
He suddenly collapsed!
06 eyecatch
The ambulance was going beepo beepo, wasnt it? err, I forgot the English equivalent for this XD
Yeah, theres nothing to worry about.
Whats wrong? This isnt like you.
Well be busy with Christmas preparations tomorrow, after all.
You didnt get any confetti today.
But that mans going to get better soon.
Fujimoto-san was angry.
I like girls like you, Kobato-chan.
On Christmas Day
Ill see you later, then!
Yeah.
I wonder if Fujimoto-san is still upset with me.
Kobato-chan.
Kobato-chan.
Confetti! A whole bottle full!
Good morning.
boxTo Mom
Now lets start the Christmas party!
Thats true.
Santa-sans here!
Santa-san, presents!
Thank you!
Stop trying to look out for me. DICK!

Im saying
Anyway, dont worry about it.

youll eventually catch a cold with the window open.
Why not try a Valentines party?
so helping out at Chiroru might be difficult
Its all right!
Then good luck.
Thank you.
Youve worked plenty.
Then, would you put away the sign out front?
Ioryogi-san?
Its a world with humans!
And this is Syaoran-kun.
I see!
Ioryogi-san?
Thats not what it means!
Shut up, you white meatbun!
You stupid little
You dont have money?
Well, we dont have any girls, so camping out should be fine.
B-But
Its all right!
But I only have one futon
Then we really shouldnt
Thanks, Kobato-chan.
Go!
Is that so?
Its difficult to figure that out.
also have a place I want to go to.
Someone I want to meet?
Whats with that?!
Welcome back!
It got complicated because you kept saying,
It was only one night, but it was fun!
Oh, no, sorry I couldnt be of more help.
Be careful.
There might be a lot of others, too.
Well yes.
Its supposed to be a star
My mom and dad. And my little sister!
Me?
What the heck is this?
Yeah!
Who did you give your number one chocolate to?
Um
Could you call Sayaka over for me?
Just wait a little longer.
You dont have to be so obsessed with it.
Are you saying this building is more important than the children?
And do what? Keeper: orig line "What can you do by going there? "
Why did he suddenly show up?
President?
Thats
Im on a waiting list myself.
Chise-chan
Okiura-san!
Thatll settle everything.
I wanted to ask about how you really feel.
Chitose-san said that
Okiura-san, if you still treasure Sayaka-sensei,
So
I think you did it to protect Sayaka-sensei.
Even so
B-But
You were standing for a long time in the rain?
If you still think Okiura-san is precious to you
We apologize for the inconvenience, but this preschool has been closed. We humbly apologize. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the principal, Okiura Sayaka.
Lets bring these over to the entranceway.
Thank you.
In the end, I made the decision myself.
16 eyecatch
The neighbors left, so Ill be off too.
Youre going out?
What about that mean-looking guy?
Um today is goodbye
Get a grip!
Because he works too hard
Thats why, Kobato-chan
Thats not for me to do. Im not a cougar.
Sorry, Kobato-chan.
Th-Thank goodness that your injuries werent severe
I told you the first time we met at Yomogi Preschool.
How can we extend that deadline?
If it werent for that battle, that girl wouldnt have
Good morning, Kobato-san, Fujimoto-kun.
Good morning!
Where are you going today?
Fun?
Only for you.
Hey!
Ill work hard!
Yes!
Were moving!
Fujimoto-san had to pay for me again
Hey, Kohaku!
Kobato-san made her decision.
Does that refer to those in the Spirit World too?
Are you happy?
Thats good to hear.
Thank you.
Oh, I see.
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, Kobato.
Well, she only said shed call when she'd settled in
Wait a second!
Sorry, Kobato.
Thank you, Ioryogi-san.
Is that the stuffed animal?
I was very happy to be by your side, Fujimoto-san!
Always
Confetti?
Please!
Damn it!
Goodbye.
Kobato. 24 TL
The confetti
Are you okay?
I see. Thanks.
Sorry... for saying something weird.
Is it true that you didnt go to the professors seminar?
kidsWow!
We all came to see it!
Yes?
If the construction machinery was seized, we wouldnt know what to do.If we had continued to use that construction machine, who knows what would have happened.
You dont have to worry about the rest,
Stop! Please!
Up until now
Ive been looking for that person since then.
Um, are you all right?
To be beside my most important person
If we were to meet again, I told myself to say it with a smile this time
It starts here, doesn't it?
The journey to make my wish come true.
What's your wish?!
What do you have to do in order to make your wish come true?
Before that?
I'm sorry.
Okay...
...the trash.
Right.
He's so cool.
What's the matter, Ms. Sayaka?
It's probably a cherry blossom festival.
Let's go check it out.
All right.
So you're a great help.
I'm glad I could be of some help!
Coming!
Yeah, I am.
B-But it'd be a waste not to eat it...
It's really good.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does!
You're really capable despite your age.
What?
She's working hard so she can support her child.
Please let me sing.
The flowers that bloom during Spring
It seems like he stopped crying.
It's thanks to you.
Yeah! Sing more!
Then...!
It's the first time he's been so happy from listening to someone other than his mother sing.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Yes?
This is...
Is this the real, real thing?
Your wish will come true.
Yes.
Kobato Hanato, what's your wish?
You're still far away from your goal!
Super fast!
First, let's see what you consider proper form for a maid.
Now I bring it back.
You can bring it back?!
Oh, I see. So you're a picky eater, then?
Many of my friends were actually slain using the things they like.
But I'll let you know this one.
You said "foolish, inferior" again.
Oh, right.
Mhmm. Wait, what?!
Well, maybe for one round.
That girl's looking our way. Someone you know?
This man is trying to seduce Miss Kobayashi.
No.
The laws are strict in this world, too.
Right!
And if we don't point it out, the developers don't notice either.
Huh?
You really like Kobayashi-san, huh?
Hmm, none left.
Yes.
Hey!
No!
I bought you some personal clothes, anyway.
Ah...
Am I a demon?!
Just try it on.
Oh, it's already time?
You look it up like this.
Hmm, I still don't quite get it.
I'll ask Fafnir-san again.
Kill th
Mhmm...
You remember Nidhogg-kun, right?
I see now! Thank you very much!
The laundry won't dry at this rate, will it?
I guess I still need to teach her a lot of things.
No. But I want to sleep with you, so I'll sleep!
Do as you please, then.
Does it still hurt?
That's good, then.
Welcome home, Miss Kobayashi.
blur4.2Next Episode
You mean me, then?
So I'm enough for you!
This is Kobayashi. She's my guardian.
You don't seem to be dressed like much of a maid.
I've heard the rumors about you in the shopping district.
What's that?
Mm.
Blue.
soft!
I know that much!
I read that, too!
This spot's most comfortable.
Saikawa, that's too tight.
Hey, Saikawa.
Yes?
Frankly, I'd love to marry you.
Huh?
Back then...
Misunderstanding?
So the misunderstanding you want to clear up is...?
This is Shouta's house.
What are you, Lucoa-san?
Hmm, so you summoned Lucoa-san in order to prove your own power?
Now that you mention it...
My mother handles all the housework.
I don't want to be a farmer.
But I don't need it.
Stay out!
What is he up to?
So, now you're all set for the call and respond part of tomorrow's event!
That's right.
Today we're having curry.
I won't lose today.
Another all-nighter today?
Don't you know, Miss Kobayashi?
I shouldn't say this after recommending them for each other, but Mr. Takiya's incredible.
As far as I'm concerned,
However...
You're a hit.
Oh, so this is the beach in this world!
The ocean here's salty?
No, that's out.
I-I don't know where to look...
Nice, aren't they?
Because I don't have much else to do this summer.
Oh, right.
Switch, then.
You obliterated every last trace of it.
Why not?
Oh, you're right. He is scary, that Leviathan.
I saw him from behind and mistook him for Rahab when calling out to him.
I can. Swimming to my heart's content feels really good.
Sure.
Well, I guess it's time for lunch.
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!
What's wrong, Tohru?
I'm feeling listless.
Hup.
I thought about introducing you to my parents.
But maybe that's all the more reason I want to cherish this time we have together.
You mean I've become an adult?
Most people don't try to become adults, they just can't stay children any longer.
Oh, you've hooked something, Miss Kobayashi.
Dragon fireworks?
There's a lot here that can't be shown to children.
Sure thing.
Hmph. All right then.
I thought you were a cosplayer from abroad.
You're in character.
No, I'm the real thing!
Thank you very much!
Bug collecting...
Wait, it's way too dangerous to be selling that to others!
There are a lot of humans dressed up like the races from my world.
Please don't run!
Dragons must be doing some crazy things.
Sorry for the wait!
Huh?!
Oh, it's almost time.
I think it's something that only exists in this place in this moment right now.
I see. I'm sorry for ditching you.
So how was it? What'd you think of your first Comiket?
Huh?
How about a dragon maid girl?
Well, I think you should study something that you find
mysterious or would like to know more about.
Yes. I'm the best!
I'll win next round!
For you and Miss Kobayashi to fight.
Are you saying you and a dragon are equals, human?!
I'm back!
I'm sorry.
What's that?
Oh, would you like some?
What's this? Where do they sell it?
Th-The shopping district, I guess?
She's done it now.
T-Tohru!
Even after everything, your food's still delicious, Tohru.
What's wrong, Tohru?
Last time they fought
I'm taking you home, Tohru!
I simply respected order like she said.
Be quiet!
Sorry for the intrusion!
This is where I work.
So this is just a coincidence? Why?
Then you do this.
Oh, could it be that you can't go back?
Hmm.
There's a strange smell on you.
You've picked up another weird phrase.
Can't breathe...
I'll prove myself useful at this job.
I want to take it easy today.
Even the furniture's...
Good grief.
You're spinning your wheels though.
It's like you've reverted to how you were when you first came to me.
You're always helping me out.
I'm not used to being wanted.
Well, um...
You're surprisingly forward.
I'm not!
Please be sure to have your guardian look over the information we just handed out.
Tug-o-war?
and lots of other events where the whole class works together!
Oh!
Saikawa said mothers and fathers come with us.
A mother? I'm not that old... Wait.
Some of my old classmates do have children already...
For one thing, I'm not exactly Kanna-chan's mother anyway.
What's wrong?
It's my first time seeing you worry about something like this.
Oh.
So, good luck with your work, Kobayashi.
Oh, right.
Thirty-nine!
You're all able to jump a lot now, huh?
Let's keep it up and work hard toward winning the sports festival!
Kanna-san, let's do our best!
You're working hard.
Planning to go to the sports festival?
No.
Want some help with your work?
I could go for both!
Oh, there's Kanna.
I'm rooting for you!
Do your best!
Okay, next pair.
Come on, Saikawa. It's our turn.
We'll now be taking a break for lunch.
Be careful of heat stroke and be sure to drink plenty of water.
Thanks for the food!
Eat plenty, and give it your best today.
Umm, ma'am, if you could please...
Still, the surprising pairing of grape and pear would be good, wouldn't it?
Twenty-two, twenty-three...
Forty-two, forty-three...
Get them!
Keep this pace up!
Yeah, they'll be in first after this next one.
Makishima, keep it up!
Do your best!
Goal!
That was incredible, Kanna-chan!
We won because you closed the gap as much as you did.
That's fine. It's better being with everyone else.
Thank you for lunch too, Lady Tohru.
Mhmm.
Is that all right?
You're the pride of our shopping district.
So that's how things turned out.
I'd like to help out too, but right now I've got work...
A play sounds great!
She lights match after match, and eventually her beloved dead grandmother appears.
and the grandmother gently hugs the little girl.
Die!
Will we be all right?
Boring.
Matches? Do you need any matches?
We don't really understand your directing policy to begin with.
Me, me!
Let me be the director.
Well, leave that to me.
Wha...
Cheer up.
Of course!
Hello, this is the Kobayashi residence.
Oh, you mean that old man who's covered in blood?
Hmm, all right.
Hey, you, where are you going?
Are there any dragons?
Will he really come?
My old wife made these.
Are you all right?
What's this turn of events?
Oh? Why do you wish to be a magical girl?
You are truly human.
I'm a magic fairy.
I won't allow you to toy with the hearts of others.
Leave this to me and go!
Yeah, yeah!
One, two, one, two, one, two...
I'm sorry. I'm didn't mean ill by it.
I'll turn you to dust!
Well...
Well, since it is Christmas...
What a beautiful sight!
Miss Kobayashi.
That's a big help.
It's a valuable item in the other world.
But everyone enjoyed it.
Congratulations!
Hooray!
Happy New Year!
Kobayashi, do you have to go to work anymore?
It's a maid's responsibility to take charge and make sure
Do you need to use the toilet?
And pass the remote.
i1You can look forward to several outstanding guests performing in our competition!
Tohru, isn't this a lot of work for you?
Here's some of the mochi we made. Have some.
Oh, the zodiac animal?
reached the god fastest on the morning of the new year, right?
I can't accept it at all!
New Year's Cards?
I haven't written one of these in years.
Incredible, Kobayashi-san. That's like a magic trick.
Kanna-san!
I wanted to go traditional.
Really?
Yeah. I used to drink something like this often.
You want one?
I'm from a family of mages.
How'd Comiket go?
What's that?
I don't really get, but it sounds like a great curse.
Hey, isn't it almost time?
seven,
Tohru.
Since it's warm under the kotatsu.
I'll make some sweet red bean soup later, too.
You get a special treat, Kobayashi-san!
I want to watch anime.
It's closer to you, isn't it?
Mhmm.
What do I do!?
I'll call again sometime.
Eh?
Hmm?
Occasionally we chat on the phone.
Oh!
Yeah, it fell right...
Kanna, if you don't eat quick, you'll be late.
Hmm?
a6Beat the dust,
a6Wipe it out,
Entrance, check!
Please stamp here.
I must prepare the best omurice ever!
Finished!
It's not that it isn't good, but...
They're damn good!
What about the rice and vegetables?
Demons out! Blessings in!
The deadline's almost here!
Coming up.
Whoa! It's a dragon! Hug me!
Or I'll eat you!
a6Hey, don't you get tired of talking that way?
Eh? Well yeah...
He should try...
Oh! You're a good drinker!
I'm out there working my ass off, and for what!?
Listen! A maid isn't just a simple servant!
Normally they're divided by their roles into house maids, laundry maids,
I'm Tohru.
I again failed to tell her they were good.
I can't believe it's raining all of a sudden!
No.
I first met that human in the ruins of an abandoned village.
All my comrades have been captured,
Would it ever end?
I'd wear a cute maid outfit,
and my only two choices were becoming a bandit or becoming a slave, then...
Yeah.
You're right.
I've sure blended in to this world...
I wonder what she's like when she's shopping.
Huh?
In that case, I'll take two of those and two dried jack mackerel.
Or rather...
Getting along well?
It's clearly a touchy topic for her.
Understood!
You want to hold hands a little longer?
I invited her into my house...
What's your name?
I know that you've seduced her.
She's an acquaintance of mine.
I saw you on your date at the bazaar!
Why you!
I think your dead-fish eyes are scary, Miss Kobayashi.
It's like this?
Yes.
Once you have one, two's nothing.
Let's live together.
I'm so glad I fell in love with Miss Kobayashi.
There!
Well, whatever.
Wait, wait, wait!
Huh? I thought you were going to sleep?
The source of my power is electricity.
If we're playing around, keep it to human standards.
And that exhausted behavior is totally me, yeah.
Guess we can play shiritori.
You want to emphasize that?
Otherwise, you'll be hit by a car.
She seems to possess a license, but she doesn't have a car.
Oh, but it would be really easy if she had you carry her!
Wow, you've got another relative with you?
And that?
It looks like it uses the principle of levers, but...
a6There!
My everything?
How is it?
Make us proper normal ones today, please.
Okay.
And with that...
I don't intend to go back.
Crap!
You'll be late!
Sorry about this.
I'll pass tonight.
Wh-What's the matter, Kanna-san?
Kobayashi-san, it's me!
Why?
I'm home, Kobayashi-san.
I want to be here.
What is it?
That won't change how I feel!
If the dragons charged with defending order found you to be in this world,
Tohru.
I truly do respect you, Father.
my light!
If you defy me, I won't show mercy.
Kanna? Kobayashi-san?
You're taking it too far!
I'm thinking of going home for the first time in a while.
a6Ah, sounds nice.
Come visit Maid Caf Cozy!
Today's the day we run the integration test on that program, huh?
Where did we meet?
I can turn this entire area into a sea of fire,
Because you told me that's what would be best!
Did I?
I'm sorry.
My apologies for dropping in so suddenly.
Tohru!
You receive visitors.
No problem!
By the way, I dislike eggs without yolks myself.
You stand out!
It'll put my mind at ease knowing you're here keeping the house safe.
I'm home.
She's a relative of mine I'm looking after right now.
Stul?
Huh!?
She's drunk!
It's true that Tohru's maid level is no better than that of a cosplayer!
She's just like those foreigners pretending to be ninja or samurai!
an8Better make 'em Victorian too!
I've made a habit of going drinking with Kobayashi-san to chat about maids.
Am I doing something wrong?
Hey!
But these are made out of my scales.
Ah...
Just try them on.
There you go learning stupid things.
Oh!
I'll try asking Fafnir-san again.
Yes!
I was fighting. Back in my home world.
You're talking about me, right?
Peace.
I guess I'm all you need, then!
Good grief.
We've got some good mackerel in today.
Tohru, I think you've got a knack for not understanding human emotions.
i1I guess she doesn't hate us.
Well, shall we buy some dessert?
Purse snatcher! Somebody stop him!
Uh...
Can you do it without exposing yourself as a dragon?
i1Uh-oh, this can't be good...
Tohru!
an8Impressive!
an8I can sleep soundly tonight!
Oh?
Break up with her! Give her back!
Ah...
You were careless there, huh, Tohru?
I need you, Lady Tohru.
You're trying to use me!
Trust is something that comes later, after you've become friends or lovers.
But we can live together.
She wants to run around and play outdoors.
Who knows?
Yes.
So there you have it, Kanna.
No!
Otherwise, you'll be hit by a car.
Oh, but it would be really easy if she had you carry her.
Tohru said she was going to teach her some things, but I'm so worried.
Tohru seems to have her act together, though.
That's wicked!
i1How do they play?
And that?
an8Yes, it's fine, it's fine.
Truth be told, I was on the verge of death,
It's not practice for catapults?
Like it?
Hmm...
i1Honestly, they all seem the same.
Bugs!? Not bacteria!?
I've done it with Kanna before.
Really? How envious.
But please put away your trash and clothes.
It's my place
Miss Kobayashi!
Shall I wash your back?
Besides, this world has a lot of restrictions.
Let's do this!
Tohru.
Yes?
As thanks for yesterday, I'll wash your body for you.
Hello. Did you need something?
What's with that metaphor?
Okay.
Anyway, we have someone suffering from a hangover,
You people are too noisy!
Uh, can I say something?
So why don't we figure out when each of us wants that peace and quiet
Jeez, you're too kindhearted.
Guess I'll join you.
Keep it down!
In return, can I call some friends too?
I'm getting the feeling you don't mean that.
Makes me want to end it.
I'm Kobayashi from Jigokumeguri System Engineering.
Magic words that let even shy people introduce themselves.
Oh, heya, Tohru.
That's more like it!
Now, ignore that treasure chest.
That was a mimic.
Let's eat, then. What do you say to some liquor?
Curses?
Don't talk about that!
This guy's out of the question!
Ah...
Do you wanna go to school?
Times may change, but stationery stores never do.
That's scary!
You heard the little lady.
Come on, Miss Kobayashi!
This is the only place in the area that sells backpacks.
I think the school said to get these ones.
Why is that?
No fair, Miss Kobayashi!
How's it going? Think you can learn it?
Let's forget all this and start over.
i1Keep an eye on Kanna, okay?
for this problem...
Can you solve it?
Sure.
See you tomorrow, everyone.
Not! Keep your mouth shut!
You're so cute it both makes me mad and want to hug you!
I challenge you, Kobayashi Kanna!
Right.
It looked like fun.
You can hang it on your backpack.
Here.
I was told to put them on all my things.
You can tell?
Bring me something else to play.
Oh, welcome home, Kanna.
I'll kill them.
Wait, wait. What era did you punks come from?
Yeah. You're so nice, Saikawa.
I love you.
What do you think?
That's the thing that lets you fly!
Cut it out.
Wh-What'd you say!?
So, did you find enough people?
They looked down on us proud, noble dragons!
We won't go easy on you.
Got it!
Oh, I'll restore the playground.
And manipulate the memories of any witnesses too.
Hunch your back more!
i1Keeping things on my level.
Look, Kanna.
Isn't this cute?
Okay, class is starting, everyone.
i1What's gotten into them?
Aren't you happy we won the dodgeball game, Kanna?
Huh?
Thank you.
Got it.
As of late, you've seemed more laid back.
i1I wonder how I used to be before.
Tohru.
an8i1A fire broke out at a West Tatsumi residence early this morning.
Kobayashi.
i1perception blocking.
There was an error in the deployment,
Our hands are tied right now.
I'll be right over.
The schedule for this part is pushing it.
What's wrong with you?
i1What's his problem?
Oh, I'm sorry. I had lots to do
I'm sorry.
Whoa!
How could you tell?
I just had a hunch.
Of course!
i1I wonder how I used to be before.
i1I've long since forgotten.
Get into pairs and draw a picture of your friend.
an8i1The monster is said to be more than 20 meters tall.
When you return to our world,
Oh well.
And if it isn't Sir Fafnir.
How did you find this place?
Well, come on in.
Wh-What would you do without me?
That wasn't right.
i1They can do anything if the fancy strikes them? Talk about a lazy, fiendish species!
I see.
And that's that.
Look for the spoon's center of gravity,
Huh?
At least this is.
It looks like we'll have leftovers,
so you get extra.
Hey, Kanna! Hey, Kanna!
Because you know a lot about maids.
but you're not exactly dressed the part.
This is the kind of uniform an apprentice maid put together with her allowance.
I've always wanted to discuss the maid life with you.
This way, please!
Let's play in my room.
I wanna play.
Oh, th-there, red.
Red.
Fun, huh?
Cool.
I can't breathe, Saikawa.
O-Of course you are.
Kanna...
Join us in extolling the virtue of maids.
So she's not a maid, but a maid fanatic?
I've been hanging out with you here a lot recently,
I've been meaning to ask you something.
Right. You mentioned something like that before.
Anyway, that's how she lost her divinity.
or "Venusian."
He's always like that when I'm around.
I've tried to sleep with him,
Y-You demon!
So yeah, we end up going full circle like that every time.
Small world, huh?
Shouta!
It just won't let up.
Okay, Kobayashi. I'm out.
Later.
No overtime today, Miss Kobayashi?
I'm really glad you came home early.
I saw him today.
I know.
What's your level now?
i1You can identify the busts almost immediately,
It sure is raining cats and dogs.
I like the rain.
Come this way, please. Your swimsuit is too risqu.
I wanna play already.
What do you want to play, Miss Kobayashi?
What's wrong with you today, Miss Kobayashi?
Why'd we come here today, then?
G-Got it.
Am I applying it right?
Lucoa.
That's it. Now keep going straight.
Why not?
I nearly got myself killed by him once. It was horrible.
Oh, right, humans can't breathe underwater.
You went overboard!
I came here with my family when I was a kid.
I call my parents every now and then to let them know how I'm doing.
Is that what a normal human family is like?
i1How could she accept me, a dragon, given that?
How about a ride?
What do you mean?
In my parents' eyes, I'm probably the odd one out of the two.
Besides, most people don't grow up because they want to.
As I kept recommending him new games and anime,
He's really enjoying life in this world!
Yes?
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much!
i1I didn't expect it to be this intense.
Hey, you're doing great out here.
I've been waiting for this!
Crunchy...
You're basically doing the same thing.
Normally, we live our lives in our human forms,
You there, come with me!
Wait a sec!
She never learns.
Of course!
Excuse me! Can I get one too?
Oh, hello.
Um...
i1Comic Market 90 is now over.
So, thoughts on your first Comiket?
What should I do?
Looks like we'll have to settle this once and for all.
Best-of-three!
The winner of our first dish...
Got it.
See you soon.
It sends chills down my spine.
Th-The shopping district, I guess?
Bringing stuff from the other world is cheating.
T...
Thank you!
They're like oil and water.
Dragons are a cut above
You're one of the bad guys?
No, that is not true.
Let's settle things in this alternate reality I created.
Let's not do this.
Wait, you mean it's a coincidence? Why are you doing this?
Well, just you watch.
And then you push this.
Good to know.
Can't I get paid tomorrow?
In terms of strength, yes,
Well, I'm sure you've got a ton on your plate, but hang in there.
Tonight's dinner is...
That'd be nice, but...
As you can see, I can make a room spotless when I put my mind to it!
I'll make breakfast!
Roger that!
I knew it. Tail again.
What?
Saikawa, what's a "sports meet"?
Pull ropes...
Give it up.
Take down Hades!
Nuh-uh...
Pull yourself together, Miss Kobayashi!
I think that's why she wants you to be there for her.
What's the matter?
Shut up! You got a problem with that?
Not so much a problem as I just don't believe you.
If I want to go, huh?
Are you still upset, Kanna?
Block perception of me.
Kobayashi.
Good night.
Thirty-nine!
Nope.
Realized I should go.
Want me to lend you a hand?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, there's Kanna!
We have to link shoulders now.
Time to eat.
Here, Miss Kobayashi.
Tch.
This lunch really is good.
i1How do you expect me to choose just one from over ten different combinations?
i1No, wait! Chest
Let's do this!
Fight!
Milady!
That's it! Class 2 wins!
Keep the pace up!
i1Let's all cheer for them harder than ever!
Do your best, Saikawa.
i1Whoa, Class 2 is gaining quickly!
Leave it to me.
Um, I'm sorry!
But you must be at least a little frustrated you couldn't go all out.
I had fun with everyone.
You're very welcome.
Yeah.
i1Which one...
That's right.
Of course!
Y-Yeah...
Hold on just a second!
I made time in my busy end-of-year work schedule!
It's a bit late for that.
So?
As she lights the next match,
The grandmother strangled her own grandchild?
Well, yeah.
I'm Fafnir, the director.
Matches, matches. Would you like to buy some matches?
Boring.
You're all useless.
Kanna's been chosen to play the lead.
Would you like to buy some matches?
i1It's me.
Agreed!
Will he really come?
Let's burn this and warm you up, then.
Who are you? What do you want?
I want to feed my sick wife good food,
This really is embarrassing!
The time we spent together was the best of my life.
Wh-Who would do something like this?
Revenge for your lord? How amusing!
I'll turn you to dust!
If you do that...
How was our play?
Good. I'm proud of you guys for pulling it off on your own.
N-No, it isn't!
I got you some medicine that works wonders for back pain.
No, I got them because I'm a regular here in the shopping district.
I have Winter Comiket at the end of the year.
Oh, you're right.
Welcome home.
You don't have to go to work anymore?
I already borrowed tools for mochi pounding and soba making.
i1Our huge New Year's bargain sale starts soon! Doors open at 6:30 AM on New Year's Day!
Thanks!
What's wrong?
Don't mention it. Look at what Sone gave us.
Oh, this year's zodiac animal?
Is that a chant?
I found it while looking up New Year's stuff on the Internet.
Here.
She lent it to me so we can wear them together.
A kimono, huh?
Why are you here?
I ran into Elma on the way.
Hey, Kobayashi.
I know, right?
Don't you want a charm, Shouta?
I don't really get it, but it definitely sounds like a curse.
I wonder what's going on.
New Year's soup is served!
I had Miss Kobayashi tell me how her family makes it.
It doesn't air during New Year's.
What should I write?
Y-Yeah.
You all hanging in there?
I usually spend New Year's catching up on a year's lost sleep.
Money on the three pointer!
Oh, Miss Kobayashi.
Rice omelette, I guess?
Leave it to me!
All right!
 Seek and destroy the dust. 
 Erase it! Erase it all! 
Rooster, check!
It's all for Miss Kobayashi!
Presto!
How's that?
Soft, melty eggs and warm rice, all covered in ketchup!
People always complain about me showing off skin, so I toned it down.
Sure. Thanks.
No wonder it's such a popular store.
See ya.
Ingredients, huh?
This is already the lowest I can go.
Okay...
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
They're damn good!
Lucoa!
i1Come to think of it,
Get me another, my man!
or your life is forfeit!
maybe they should try
I lost in a battle with the gods and fled to this world.
Drink up!
So you were a girl.
Well, technically.
Kobayashi!
Welcome home, Miss Kobayashi!
Your rice omelette is ready.
Time to grind.
i1So cute!
Let's see... If I had to say, there was one.
so I'm all alone now and don't know where to go from here.
Hey, what's it like to be a dragon?
Yup!
Yup. It's a book all about the language of flowers.
This is all me!
I don't want to.
Huh?
Can't defy the Emperor of Chaos.
Crap!
Kobayashi.
Kobayashi.
Working overtime until this late.
Yeah.
Goodnight, Lady Kanna, Milady.
Wh-What's wrong, Kanna?
I did.
Tohru.
But I can do anything that won't kill you.
She's not responsible for what others do after her!
I'm perfectly aware of that.
And, you know, she's my maid!
But only as a dragon.
Miss Kobayashi is special!
This is your final warning.
Stay out of this, human.
Sorry, Miss Kobayashi, but please stay away for now.
No!
We've been co-existing for ages now.
The question is whether we can believe it'll last.
Tohru,
Sorry for acting of my own accord there.
I'll be off.
Tohru.
Come visit Maid Caf Cozy!
So, uh...
Mountains...
or curse people to death!
I have to ask, though. Why a maid?
I'm sorry.
Ahem.
You cook!
Let's start with telling me what you dislike.
My friend, Herensuge, was hit with one and killed.
You know I'm a woman, right?
Yeah, let's not do that.
Simplegon.
Understood!
i1Kill all who try to steal your treasure.
We saw one!
I didn't even get to kill them either.
Wait, what?
Oh? Are you not going to drink any liquor, Tohru-chan?
an8It's common practice for schedules to be based on people taking on extra roles.
an8Common practice!
i1I can't follow what they're saying at all.
Are you trying to make fun of maids?
Yes, I understand.
So all humans soil their clothes with perspiration, huh?
Don't lick me either!
Try listing the steps for doing laundry.
Good.
I told you, I can produce saliva that eliminates all
Thank you very much!
Would you like to drink my fresh blood?
Just try them on.
Tohru, what cup are you?
Understood!
Have a safe trip.
Now, then.
I found you.
All right, good night.
Did it hurt?
'Sup faggots!
Huh?
Seems like you base just about everything on your past experiences, huh?
Well, let's start by buying the fish.
It's not often I see you with a companion.
We've got some good mackerel in today.
How about it?
Why are you friends with the fishmonger?
an8Here and there.
an8Huh? Thank you, but I'm good on that front.
Speaking of lightning, the Norse god Thor's name is pretty close to yours. Coincidence?
Huh? Your parents
Purse snatcher! Somebody stop him!
Huh?
Um, your hand...
i1What to do about this?
What did you just say?
Figured.
I saw Tohru-sama's fire breath on that cloudy day,
Why not?
I'm in love with Kobayashi-san!
It would be futile for me to try sending her back.
But we can live together.
When I was a kid I spent my days playing video games, though...
I'm going to sleep off the fatigue from my deathma.
So it returned after I recharged.
Huh?
That's fiction. Reality doesn't work that way.
Keep your playing around to my level.
First, let's try to recall how Kobayashi-san usually acts.
i1I've seen it a few times now, but it's still terrifying.
i1Ah, not a chance.
Hmm...
Tropic.
Now, then.
How do they move?
I guess power comes at a price in every world.
an8For real?
an8Yeah.
You can get through most conversations using them, so try to remember them.
Can you use perception blocking, Kanna?
Okay.
This is fun!
I see.
Yeah.
This place sure has gotten cramped.
A three-bedroom apartment?
I think I can see that. What kind of places do you normally look for?
Now that's just being nitpicky!
But please put away your trash and clothes.
It's my place
Her dead-fish eyes are to die for!
Oh, I still had these?
Whoa, my bad!
I put it on once, and I looked so awful that I dropped the idea for good.
In dragon sizes, yes.
Bath time!
Well, you're not wrong, but...
Please do.
Try not to make things worse.
Uh, I heard some loud noises, so I got worried and came to check it out.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but could you take care not to make so much noise?
Yep. Wanna listen?
Some strange noise is too annoying!
Anyways, I don't mind that much when I don't have a hangover.
Am I loud and obnoxious?
Okay.
What should I do about this?
A party?
Yeah.
Now here's a good goth loli.
Yes?
Kobayashi-san, this is Fafnir-san.
Huh?
Yeah, why?
What!?
Good job defeating it!
I suppose you changed her.
Fine by me, but only if I can check for curses first.
She lost her divinityvirginity thanks to an alcohol-related mishap a long time ago.
Stop it. You'll mess up my inputs.
Ah, to be young again.
Hurry! Hurry!
Now, now, Kanna.
Quit badgering Kobayashi-san.
Yeah!
What's that look for?
What!?
Everyone used quills in the other world.
Oh, I heard a new store opened outside the shopping district recently.
You write stuff with it.
That's a tool for branding slaves.
Look, Tohru-sama.
Sure. Thank you.
Sometimes you're singled out.
Tohru-sama.
Looks like introductions are going well.
Did Kanna really want to do that stuff?
Sure.
Scared of things that are different from the norm.
i1But that doesn't stop them from trying to get the strong on their side.
See you tomorrow, everyone.
She's completely hopeless.
Nobody asked for your opinion!
Living among them doesn't mean we have to lead the same lives as they do.
Yay!
Simplegon.
Sorry I keep dropping by all the time.
What happened?
It's a hidden gem.
Let's just take over this place.
I challenge you...
I'll give you the honor of facing me in dodgeball tomorrow!
And you, black-haired mama's boy!
Nope.
All right, let's do this!
Don't worry. It'll work out somehow.
Don't kill anyone.
i1It went way beyond one-sided domination.
Yeah. They're the worst of the worst.
Me three.
Only one way to find out.
I'll play too!
We quickly went from one dragon to four.
Isn't this cute?
You're wicked, Saikawa.
We nearly lost that playground.
Sorry!
Beer, beer.
How's this?
By the way, the roof of this property is a communal space.
First, we clean up.
Yeah!
Cleaning, cleaning, la la la.
sometimes ruins,
They were so annoying.
So not only did my body keep getting dirty, I had a hard time bathing at all.
That's naughty by human standards!
But please clean up your trash and clothes.
Fine.
Well, next up's packing.
Lady Tohru, so pretty!
Good morning!
This will be the living room.
By the way.
Oh well, fine.
Here I go!
Good morning, Miss Kobayashi.
You're welcome.
Kobayashi, does your hangover hurt?
Coming.
Oh, you're from next door.
How does she make that much noise making this?
A drill?
This is well done.
That death metal voice is too loud!
to others when people go about their lives.
But...
An excuse?
They're all well-behaved dragons.
Hmm, I'm only worried.
I'm home.
Please wait one moment.
He's a cursed dragon who's been guarding his treasure in a cave since ancient times.
He's a shut-in?!
That was a mimic.
Though I'll never say it to her.
and in her drunken stupor she went to her little sister and
Yes.
I've told you before, that's just cosplay!
If you've got complaints, then strip!
It's my nature.
Maybe I'm getting used to this world in general.
So they use sound to court their partners?
Goodbye.
It's about Yamashita-kun's project.
But...
Kobayashi!
The manager's pushing all his work onto Kobayashi-san again.
Quit dawdling and get it done already!
i1Sh-She doesn't know I'm here, right?
Tohru.
You really were!
You must've been bored out of your mind watching me work.
Fafnir-san!
I was so surprised to find you spacing out there.
not stay with us, it seems.
Oh?
as well as a bank account and personal seal.
That's right.
You've been influenced too much.
Huh?
I'll be fine.
Is this world worth that much to you?
It is.
So, what's your budget?
Yeah, about that...
What other kinds are there?
an8i1I will now bend the spoon.
Look! Look, Kobayashi!
Anyone?
Training!
Kobayashi, I'm hungry.
Star!
No matter what.
It's child's play once you figure out how it works.
I understand.
Okay, I'll show you a power only I have!
I learned a new magic trick, Kobayashi-san!
Oh?
To your house?
A maid...
You'll come, right?
Because you know a lot about maids.
This is Kobayashi. My guardian.
Precisely.
...are kindred spirits!
Let's play in my room.
Wh-What do you want to play?
The kids version.
Sure, let's give it a go.
Red.
I wanna play a video game.
Something fun.
Is this first flush?
but I want something like what Kobayashi and Tohru-sama have.
I want us to be closer.
Let's get even closer.
"Georgie" is the nickname she goes by when she's acting as a maid.
so I figured that it'd just be easier.
I mean, sure, why not? As long as it's fine with you.
Huh? Is someone performing a ritual nearby?
Never mind that you agreed to serve him.
What's the problem?
I'm hoping you two can set them straight.
Nobody's home at this time of day.
If you had to classify me, it'd be as an "ex-god," I guess.
Sounds like someone's home.
Can you really blame him? He's living with an exhibitionist bombshell.
That's why, to ease his nervousness a bit,
I invited them over today to help you understand the truth about me.
What do you mean?
I see.
You summoned Lucoa-san to show off your power?
Really?
Eventually.
Okay, Kobayashi-san. I'm out.
Later.
Reigns supreme.
You fool. You can't go that way.
I got knocked out.
Around 21 or so.
280.
Another all-nighter?
Good morning, Fafnir-dono.
i1However...
so technically I'm always naked.
You've been nothing but a spoilsport.
Why'd we come here today, then?
You're playing hard to get, right?
Oh, right.
You might as well let him think you're a demon now.
I wanna play already.
Yay.
She obliterated every last trace of it.
What'd you do?
Let's race to that thing, Tohru-sama.
Please.
I think we were a perfectly ordinary family.
They even sent me to college.
I call my parents every now and then to let them know how I'm doing.
i1Does that mean the humans in this world are accepting of dragons?
But talking about my parents earlier made me want to see them myself.
What's weighing on your mind, then?
What do you mean?
It's sad.
Life just comes along and forces them to stop being children.
Yeah.
Uh, I can't understand a word you're saying.
Didn't you ask Fafnir-san?
I see. But why would Fafnir-san do that?
Please don't run.
But just what is it?
What are you looking for?
Can I take a look at your book?
And for only 1,000 yen! So cheap!
You're basically doing the same thing.
Yeah. What brings you here today?
Those things that only see us as food?
Run!
Yes.
I'm done!
Of course!
Oh, hello.
Good to see you.
Many thanks, Kobayashi-dono and Tohru-dono!
What should we do for our next doujin?
Kobayashi-san, Tohru-chan's become a hot topic on the Internet.
Huh? Hey, wait a sec!
i1We'll see you again in winter!
Oh, really now?
Really! I'm the greatest!
Then I'll just have to eclipse even that.
Field Trip...
Who are you supposed to be now?
They're both so into it.
The winner of our first dish...
How'd my special salad lose to freakin' cherry tomatoes!?
What should I pick for the dessert?
You mean to say you consider yourself equal to us dragons,
I'm sorry.
Before you talk about maintaining this world's order, try following its laws.
Wait.
Say...
There's the Order faction, which values peace,
the Chaos faction, which desires destruction,
No, that is not true.
even if I have to drag you back!
Let's settle things in this alternate reality I created.
By the way, where'd you send her?
Don't just go and send me to a different continent!
i1A ball is...
I'll be joining your workforce today.
I hope we all get along.
I work here.
I-I'm investigating.
A silly question!
What's gotten into you?
A dog?
Are you keeping an affair from me?
An office fling!?
i1I can't breathe...
Oh, how do sweet chestnuts sound?
How's that?
There's absolutely nothing here, like Shiva just passed through.
Keep breakfast on the light side, please.
All done! Here are your sandwiches!
What's going on?
You seem strangely worked up.
Not one bit. You're running around like a headless dragon.
Thanks
Kobayashi-san.
I will.
Gladly.
You're very athletic, so I bet you'll be the star of the show.
Don't be selfish.
Nuh-uh...
I don't care anymore!
It totally clashes with our deployment date.
Good night.
It seems that she went to your workplace and observed you in secret today.
For
Keep this up and try to take that gold medal home!
Yeah.
My goodness.
i1What do you want me to do?
i1What should I do?
i1I should just take both.
I-I know! I'll make up my mind now!
Ojou-sama!
All the participants pledge to uphold the spirit of sportsmanship,
Next group, get ready.
Jeez, what is Riko doing?
Huh? Me?
Okay.
We won, Kobayashi-san!
Fight hard!
Classes 1 and 2, on your marks...
i1This is the final third-grade event.
i1Class 2 has dropped its baton!
I'm so sorry!
I messed up!
It was my pleasure.
i1How my life has changed.
i1Did I change myself at some point?
Sure, as long as you don't cause any trouble.
The usual place should do.
i1Humans are terrifying!
I'm not thrilled about celebrating His son's birthday,
You're our shopping district's pride and joy.
B-But I can touch type now!
Besides, I can't meddle with this world's affairs!
It has to be something that connects with senior citizens.
Do you all have any ideas?
Hold on.
Matches, matches. Would you like to buy some matches?
I feel it.
Fail. Next.
Salespeople at work are always like this.
He looks just like a girl.
Matches,
Of course!
i1Things go wrong every time she says something like that.
I'm gonna go hop in the bath.
i1It's me.
How many times must I tell you?
Why can't you guys follow the script?
Stop making it strangely sexual!
Did we make it?
Matches, matches. Would you like to buy some matches?
I don't have any money.
Sure, got it!
I implore you, wait!
Come at me if you care not for your life!
Nobody can beat me in this form.
Technology these days.
That was amazing.
Well done.
Huh? Where is everyone?
And where's Kanna-chan?
It's a white Christmas.
My turn. Here's a Christmas present from me.
Kobayashi-san!
You deserve an Oscar for that, Fafnir-san.
Oh, you pitiful human.
I'll kill you!
That's it, a kotatsu?
Gotcha.
Happy New Year!
This is heaven! I'm so glad we won this kotatsu.
You can say that again.
You sure you're not biting off more than you can chew, Tohru?
Thank you.
Oh, hello, Yana-san.
There are 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac.
monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.
Your kimono?
Nope.
I ran into Elma-kun on the way.
Lucoa-san, what's with that kimono?
Oh, of when you got drunk and
I could make a much more effective one.
S-Stop it!
I don't really get it, but it definitely sounds like a curse.
7...
Happy New Year!
Kobayashi, can Saikawa come over to our place?
Sure.
So good!
I can't do it next year, the one after that, or ever.
Yeah.
Boring.
New Year's calligraphy?
What'll you write?
ta...
Tohru-sama?
It differs from person to person.
O-Okay, I'll give you some too!
Okay, you can try three times.
i1Our huge New Year's bargain sale starts soon! Doors open at 6:30 AM on New Year's Day!
You're asking me?
Roger that!
See you later.
Have a good day, you two!
It's nothing special!?
Thank you.
People always complain about me showing off skin, so I toned it down.
I'll make some more tea.
Thanks for the tea.
Ingredients, huh?
Would it now?
Welcome home, Kanna!
Just for a sec.
They're damn good!
I figured I should use this world's.
O-Of course not!
i1Though she usually only makes weird stuff.
Coming up.
maybe they should try
I lost in a battle with the gods and fled to this world.
I am a women!
This whole world's unfair!
Originally, there were housemaids and laundry maids.
I'm Tohru.
So, Tohru, it's not like I'm saying maid cafs are bad.
I'm home.
Yep.
You're ignoring me?
Even if it did, and I gained freedom for myself,
Come to think of it, I'd never made any choices of my own.
I'm sure I'll find something there!
Tohru, do you think that bandit girl is still alive?
Indeed.
i1Go ahead!
I'll do everything within my power as a maid to help you relax!
I should go shopping soon.
What should we have for dinner tonight?
i1Not really.
Correct. I am the doubt in your mind.
I won't.
I don't want to.
My... My home...
You're coming back with me, Tohru.
Welcome home, Kanna-chan.
Yeah.
Sorry, Kanna-chan.
Kobayashi-san.
Thanks.
Working overtime until this late.
That so?
You realize that this world is off-limits, don't you?
What is it?
If others learned of one living here, they might follow it here.
It might not be a problem yet, but eventually, someone could come here plotting an invasion.
Why are you so fixated on Tohru?
Wait, wait! Hold up!
Kanna! Kobayashi-san!
Stay out of this, human.
I'm saying you're jumping to extremes.
Tohru,
We're out of conditioner.
Okay, I'll buy more.
i1I'll simply treasure these times we have now.
We're with Maid Cafe Cozy.
Today we're running the integration test on that program, huh?
Dragons.
An imaginary creation that breathes fire, flies, and sometimes uses magic.
Would it be all right to come in?
Uh, Tohru-san? That's what I said?
Strange. I'm not waking up from this dream.
Um...
You can't.
I guess I'll hire her.
Maid Cafe Cozy.
Next! Laundry maid!
You entertain guests.
I see. I'll remember that.
You saved me, Miss Kobayashi!
I was raised to repay all favors, even if owed to foolish, inferior humans!
That's half the reason.
I think dragons are better left holding down the fort!
It'll be a relief to know you're here keeping the house safe.
Oh, right.
This is a phone.
Mhmm. Wait, what?!
Kobayashi-san.
Well, maybe for one round.
Huh?!
Besides, I've had enough of this!
T-Takiya-san?!
Huh?
Not enough embarrassment!
Hmm, none left.
Oh!
Oh, it's already time?
Yes?
What?
Miss Kobayashi!
What else?
So your standards are basically based on your past experiences, huh?
Well, let's start by buying the fish.
He gave us an extra fillet of mackerel...
I think it's probably best not to ask about that.
Huh?
I can sleep soundly tonight!
Is my package here?
What to do about this...
Cuckold.
Break up with her! Give her back!
She's an acquaintance of mine.
Lady Tohru, why are you in such an outfit?
I'm not going home.
You perverts!
Th-That's not true.
Kanna, please tell us honestly about what you're planning.
So right now she's all on her own...
Trusting someone is something that happens after you become friends or become lovers.
There!
Well, whatever.
I'm going to sleep off the fatigue from my deathma.
Wake me up when you're finished playing.
Okay, shall we play by ourselves?
You're over-exaggerating, Kobayashi.
Shoot, I'm at the disadvantage here.
So there you have it, Kanna.
Do, do... hmm...
That was fast!
I don't need grilled tail.
Wha?!
Kanna, you have things to do with me today, don't you?
How do they move?
I guess power comes at a price in every world.
Oh, but it would be really easy if she had you carry her!
Right?
A Gothic lolita with a tribal theme.
Hmm, interesting tastes.
It's sweet, like yatagarasu eggs.
While letting people think I was dead.
Beer, beer.
Yes. As close to this area as possible please.
Oh?
Cleaning, cleaning, la la la.
Bugs?! Not bacteria?!
Still, I guess you could live anywhere in that case.
Whenever I stayed in one place too long humans would soon start coming around.
That's one of the nice things about living alone.
Whoa, sorry!
Then would you mind if I wear it?
Yeah, I think it looks good.
Huh?
Yes?
Huh?
Shall I go make a complaint?
Hello. Did you need something?
My apologies, but could you please be more mindful of the noise?
A drill?
That death metal voice is too loud!
Huh?!
I'm going to rest a bit.
Okay. Then I will, too.
Straight to the point, huh?
Good evening.
Nice goth-loli.
Where are your friends?
Yes?
Tohru!
I got a really hostile feeling from him just now!
Um, did you walk here in that outfit?
But that's impossible.
If you can't, then strip!
Fafnir-dono, ignore that treasure chest.
That was a mimic, too.
Kobayashi!
How do you use it?
Then what about this?
Come on, Miss Kobayashi! Brand me as yours!
Look, Lady Tohru, a unicorn.
Part of me wants to ask, and part of me doesn't.
That'll be 38,000 yen.
so we have no choice.
Everyone should be wearing the same thing.
Kobayashi!
Huh?!
No co-signer needed Same-day financing Earn Fortune Money Boyfriend Cosigner Repay
From abroad?! Wow!
No mercy, huh?
Oh, can I call you that, too?
It's Saikawa, the one who acts like a queen!
Still, fake crying? What a roundabout way to settle things, Kanna.
i1This is today's special product!
Yeah, in the clouds.
Hey, watch it, you guys!
Whatever, we're taking over this place.
Oh?
You better get ready to lose!
So you picked a fight and they bought it, huh?
Sorry about that!
Do you know the rules?
I know them, too.
Don't worry, it'll work out.
Sorry!
The game was beyond one-sided.
They destroyed them.
That phrasing may be accurate, but it's cruel.
Hey, Kobayashi, this is super interesting.
Hey, Kanna-san.
I must be improving my skills as maid.
Oh, not done yet.
Huh?
N-No one's found out, right?
Miss Kobayashi's so cool!
Mr. Fafnir!
Hmph. I guess I'll see what you can do.
Your dragon form looked like an Ooyama Takeshi, so...
I don't intend to return to my world.
The more I treasure these moments and being here right now,
But I don't want to call those feelings regret.
Oh, if it isn't Kobayashi-san's maid.
No, you won't!
Shows the limits of this world.
I'm sure it's hard to live here without a human you get along with.
There is a human you'd be all right with, Mr. Fafnir!
Who is it?
Oh, if it isn't Fafnir-dono!
Y-Yes.
Sure thing.
What others are there?
S-Sorry.
Oh, that's what you were doing.
You're thinking something weird again.
That's all fiction though.
Oh, I'll fix your spoons first.
Compilation: Bear Slayer!
I can't be inferior to them in any way!
Absolutely not!
I don't think it's like that, Tohru.
I think you actually want to understand humans,
Tohru.
Once you understand, it's simple, isn't it?
I understand.
I hate this.
Okay.
All right.
As their role as servants grew larger over a long period of history,
I want to try.
Blue.
Red.
I did manage to acquire some first flush Darjeeling.
At first it was a picture book.
How about this game?
Hey, Saikawa.
You can do everything, and everyone praises you.
You decided to move from your world to ours?
Huh? To what?
I'm living at someone else's house, just like Tohru.
Okay.
when he's with an older woman whose body is an agitator of lust...
Sorry, Shouta.
Huh? But I used a demon summoning circle...
I thought it might be dangerous
so I answered the call first.
You see? It's like this every time.
So I want to hurry up and...
I kind of feel bad for Lucoa-san then.
it would cause trouble for her to be summoned when she wasn't needed.
so there's no point in her staying in this home.
No, I don't want to go home!
Then how about vast magical power?
Hmm, that's kind of appealing.
It's still pouring outside.
Takiya-kun went home at the regular time, too.
I wonder if Takiya-kun and Fafnir-san are getting along well.
I saw him today.
Nyami-nyami.
I know.
Bring it on.
That's right.
About here.
Roughly 21.
This morning we have natto and rice.
It's called sharing a lover's umbrella.
the misses that trespass on my home to steal my treasure are better.
Lucoa, you're forbidden from approaching me naked from now on!
No, that's out.
It's my scales.
I'm more envious of what's filling out that swimsuit though.
Huh?!
so I figured going with everyone would be better.
I want to play now.
Now, here I go, Miss Kobayashi!
I want to play now.
Yeah, oh well.
Does she have gills or something?
Could you tell me more about your family?
Please?
Well...
I was raised normally.
They had me go to college.
Every now and then I talk to my parents on the phone to tell them how I'm doing.
What's wrong, Tohru?
Tohru.
This really is incredible.
I thought about introducing you to my parents.
I can't.
Because I'm sure they'd kill you.
and "understanding each other".
It makes me realize we've lived in vastly different worlds.
But maybe that's all the more reason I want to cherish this time we have together.
I'm not sure.
Shall we head back?
Shee, shee! How'f thah, Mih Chofahashi?!
What on Earth is this?!
Everyone's just barely on the verge of running!
The end of the line for Water Dragon Shrine starts here!
Are you a cosplayer?
I'm a real maid!
I can't believe it's this bad.
Hey, thanks for your help.
I've been waiting for this!
Bug collecting...
Say nothing.
I normally live disguised as a human,
Oh, that's impossible.
Yes?
When dragons get hungry, we only eat as much as necessary...
You there!
Wait...
Oh, can I take your picture?
Over here, too, please!
Hello. I came like I promised.
Well, to be honest, it's pretty rough.
I'm back.
I see. I'm sorry for ditching you.
And I'd like to ask for your help as staff again this winter!
Nice!
Free studies?
Hmm?
Oh? Look at you talk, Tohru.
What is your character even supposed to be anymore?
They're both driven to win.
Hamburger's better!
I often asked my parents to make them though...
You're to bring one item that isn't cooked.
Tohru.
Because...
Huh? Miss Kobayashi?
You're late.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I'm not going to lose either.
Sure.
Yeah.
Wow, a fruit?
T-Tohru!
Tohru!
That's dangerous!
She's easily influenced.
I've prepared another dimension, so we'll do this there.
I'm surprised to see the fiendish Tohru listening to a human.
I simply respected order like she said.
By the way, where'd you send her?
The field Kanna and I played in before.
This is where I work.
so I won't stay behind anymore!
Oh, uh, a month from now.
Well, if you commute from the other world...
Oh, could it be that you can't go back?
Welcome home!
Are you secretly cheating on me?!
Leave it to me!
Oh, Miss Kobayashi, sweet chestnuts!
Good grief.
Kobayashi.
Done!
Are you an idiot?!
What do you mean?
What are you here for?
That's never happened to me before.
What?
Then your mother will praise you!
Also, what is a sports festival?
No.
Victorious...
It's my first time seeing you worry about something like this.
Yes?
Shoot!
That's incredible.
Want some help with your work?
I'll be coming tomorrow.
You beat Hades?
I could go for both!
Oh, there's Kanna.
Where, where?
Kanna, do your best!
Riko! Fight on!
Shouta-kun, your older sister's incredible!
It's normal.
Eat plenty, and give it your best today.
Yeah.
What do I do?
Good luck!
Class 3's tripped on their rope!
Now!
Class 3 with an overwhelming victory in the cavalry battle!
We did it!
K-Kanna-san.
Nice work out there, Kanna-chan.
My life's really changed.
Still, it would be nice to let loose a little bit more today.
Oh!
Unlike Elma, Miss Kobayashi's busy.
You heard her.
A play?
Stone stage?
It's a bit of a sad story.
Oh. So she strangled her own granddaughter.
Since I'll be directing, I won't allow half-baked acting.
I can't go back to the office until I've sold them all!
None of you are any good.
We don't really understand your directing policy to begin with.
Well, leave that to me.
He passes.
Yeah, this is it.
Kanna was chosen to be our lead.
Think you can handle it?
Do you need any matches?
What did you come up with then?
Well, time to prepare Miss Kobayashi's dinner.
What's this?
How many times do I have to tell you?
Tohru! Why would a passerby use Miss Kobayashi as reason to refuse her?!
Now that you mention it, that's true...
Then why don't we try changing it up?
Let's make the story more fun.
Why not?
Umm...
My old wife made these.
Are you all right?
And they're actually setting it on fire!
to become a magical girl with a duty to bear.
My time with both of you was very enjoyable.
No way...
Well...
Huh? Where's everyone else?
Hmm.
Miss Kobayashi.
Yeah, sure...
worrying when I should jump in to stop you.
Thanks!
It's a White Christmas.
Huh?
Merry Christmas, Tohru.
But!
I can't get close!
The New Year's right after Christmas.
Okay, you get three turns.
I'll land the hot springs!
I'll buy you some nama chocolates as souvenirs.
No. You?
What are you doing?
Oh.
Oh, a guest.
Good afternoon.
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
This rooster is well made.
Good job again.
What's a zodiac animal?
Tohru.
It tastes like you.
I'm glad my kimono fits you.
Well, it is New Year's.
Oh, and because you got drunk you and your sister
Matching?
You bought an evil-banishing arrow?
How'd Comiket go?
I don't really get, but it sounds like a great curse.
Though I guess it also means things'll only get better from here.
Yay!
Hey, isn't it almost time?
Huh? Seriously?
one!
Tohru.
It's good!
I'll make some sweet red bean soup later, too.
Eh?
i1The contenders for the win have been narrowed down to two teams!
Looks fun.
Lady Tohru, you, too.
What should I write?
We're well, we're well.
Lady Tohru, don't worry.
Give everyone my regards.
I see.
New Year's ending soon.
Oh!
Yeah, it fell right...
Welcome!
Yeah, this is it.
Huh?!
That's strange.
When I was in the other world everyone used quill pens.
Part of me wants to ask, and part of me doesn't.
Well, let's go.
Kanna-chan, which one do you like?
This.
I can see why you'd choose a cursed item that's absorbed human blood.
Yeah, I agree it is.
Thanks for your concern.
Yeah, cute.
Is it something to go that far over?
She's practicing her writing.
Ushishir Island.
Yes. Now, for this problem,
I'll prove I'm better than you!
Maybe that's why I want to be with them.
Good to hear.
Miss Kobayashi!
What about me?
What are you doing?
How...
Thanks.
Sorry I keep dropping by all the time.
Today, on the way home...
Yeah. You're kind, Saikawa.
If you lose, then give up on using this place!
You American gorilla!
What do I do?
Well, what to do, then?
We won't go easy on you.
They destroyed them.
Me neither.
Are you going to surpass us today?
the playground became a battlefield.
After that, they took to playing dodgeball regularly.
Kanna-chan, look, look.
Yeah.
Leave it to me!
What's with that outfit?
The quickest way would probably be to use good ingredients, I think?
I see.
It's expensive.
Well, that's the best free-range chicken from Akita, after all.
Could you give me a discount?
Yes.
You couldn't complain if they killed you over that.
Roar, roar!
Huh?
And it was damn good!
Make sure you're making backups!
Kobayashi!
No, no, no, no!
I'm Kobayashi.
Kobayashi!
I'm confident in it!
i1Is it okay if I pet him?
Humans?
Oh? What were they like?
I was just lying low for a bit.
See?
Yeah.
Hey, hey, what's it feel like being a dragon?
I never thought of myself as free before then.
You're leaving?
Oh, Miss Dragon, let me ride you.
Bug off! I'll never let a human ride me!
Cheapskate.
Thank you, Miss Dragon!
I've sure blended in to this world...
I guess I'd like to spend my day off relaxing at home for once.
Understood!
Flower language?
Let's go with that, then.
Okay.
If you long for battle?
You're coming home with me.
Welcome home, Kanna-chan.
To the other world.
Crap!
To the other world.
I'll pass tonight.
Tohru.
I thought you went home.
Please!
I told you. We're forbidden from interfering in this world.
Because this is where I belong.
You would live a quiet life as a human?
Hmph.
I admire you.
There!
I can never understand that.
Try having faith in your daughter!
Good morning, Lady Tohru.
Morning, Kanna.
Chocolates?
I must be improving my skills as maid.
i1The secret is to marinate it in honey.
i1What modern girls want their lover to do most!
Just like birds.
i1Me, too!
Pursue love...
i1Early this morning, there was a fire in Tatsumi-cho, Nishi-ku.
It's actually magic
Ah.
So for now, I'll work on that.
But...
What?
I'll be leaving now.
You're there, right?
I wanted to know more about you.
I bought a bunch of vegetables in season!
Oh, here you go.
Oh, I guess you can't.
i1The monster was said to stand 20m at full height.
Hmph. I guess I'll see what you can do.
The more I treasure these moments and being here right now,
So, what's your budget?
I can't believe there's no money exchange.
Sure thing.
Ah, you've bent them all.
Kobayashi! That! That!
God! Kobayashi God!
Anyone can do them once they learn how.
Anyone?
I can't forgive humans!
I'm going training!
Wrong.
Absolutely.
I can produce electricity.
i1Now, the beautiful lady has entered the box. Please watch.
C-Cute!
You will fall deeper and deeper in love with Tohru! In love with Tohru!
That's not magic.
Oh well, if I must . . .
You can stick your big, fat booster shot . . .
Being alone makes me feel all desolate
Sensei!
I was thinking of changing the end of our slogan we used for third grade.
What the heck?
I am completely opposed to cutting club activities!
Crap in a hat!
Even the stupid principal does what she says!
But the kids, they would always tug and flip my skirt.
She called her "Shiro-chan!"
Shiro-chan!
Why won't you be more friendly towards your own teacher?
Look, I got myself a black one to complete the pair.
The one with light brown hair?
So why don't you just take my card?
Where's Kuro-chan?
Kuro . . .
That's right.

Kagami?
Grown-ups who always molly- coddle kids are the worst!
Really?
This kid . . . she's a girl.
When we hold hand, my heart races.
Shiro-chan, what do you think?
What do you mean by "normal?"
I've heard that Fujimori-san's daughter, Chika-chan, is getting married!
Your father also said so himself.
It's Shirai-sensei.
Say you're sorry! Apologize to Shiro-chan!
How's them apples?!
In my mind it's always Sunday. I love you!
be1I bought a new digital camera for the festival!
be1On that day, I'll be sure to record these glorious, once-in-a-lifetime moments!
be1Yeahhhh!
be1There's a teachers' relay, too, but...
be1N-no! You're wrong!...
be1Yes, yes, yes, yes!
be1Oh! Good idea, right?
be1would be interesting, wouldn't it?
be1Or we'll borrow a backpack and you could go as a grade schooler...
be1I'm absolutely, positively going to do my best at the sports festival!
be1Okay, bye-bye!
be1Sensei, you didn't try to molest me!
be1Wha-?!
be1Keep going, Megumi!
be1But ever since he moved away to his new job post...
be1And I wonder if my mother's mad at me.
be1Ohh, you spilled them? I'll help!
be1It's nothing. Don't make a big fuss.
be1Sensei is counting on me...
be1Huh?
be1But even though Sensei saw the weak me, the ugly me...
be1Huh?
be1Wha-?
be1Please refrain from excessive skinship!
be1Ugh.
be1Wha-! She's not wearing any panties!
be1Augh!
be1It's okay! You've got a tough job, and the sports festival-
If you don't wake up, I'm gonna tickle you!
Eh? Eh?
Hey... huh?
Cute, huh?
That's right.
I want to be a good father to you this time.
Sensei!
The class rep is a role model for everyone.
Shirai-sensei!
Let's just make whatever.
What are you gonna make?
Hmm, what about nikujaga?
Uwaaaaaaaaaaah!
Did you become class president just for me?
Everyone got their backpacks?
Oh...
Kokonoe!
Sorry, sorry!
I'm...
Oh... ah, wait!
That's because I'm a fourth grader now!
Why are you wearing those clothes?
...strange adults!
I saved my allowance to buy them...
I want to be a good father to you this time.
Good morning!
My lips just for you alone.
I'll be in charge of the class pets!
Is everyone fine with Kokonoe representing you all?
Yeah, okay...
Then I guess you're not going to bite my ears anymore?
Wow, that was rough...
Let's just make whatever!
Sensei! Look again!
He says we can make whatever we want!
I wanna eat croquettes!
Ours too!
You reap what you sow!

See you tomorrow!
I'm passing around the handouts!
Whaaat?

I just looove nikujaga!
But... just a minute ago...
Uwaaaaaaaaaaah!
What wrong, Kagami?
Are you all right, Kuro-chan?
Uh... okay.
C'mon, hurry up!
Boys, buckle down and get back to work!
She couldn't have...
Ahh! I'm beat!
Huh? Cleanup?
Rin said it'd be a pain to have to go back and get them afterwards.

Since you are new here, you may not already know this.
If the house is run-down, or if the household is out of order, what will you be able to do about it?
I must look like a total idiot.
Huh, what's this?
Rin.
Hey... hey Reiji!
For real?
I did it!

These are important info for our day in the pool.
Everyone, make sure to give these to your folks.
Yup!

Well, I wanna get big just like Mimi-chan.
Whaddya just make me do?
We'll be waiting!
Uncut virgin!
What's wrong?
I am the teacher of class 3-1 at Futatsubashi Elementary.
Er... um... do you have any parents here with you today?
Then the people living in this house now...
As her guardian, I should be concerned.
As her teacher, you better watch your step.

Not a lot you can do about the third grade.
They were second graders just a short while ago.
Hah, Kagami's hasn't changed a bit.
Sensei!
I want to practice my horizontal bar routine.
It shouldn't hurt anymore.
Synchro!
I'm sorry.
Sensei.
Dammit!
Your gym clothes are really big on you, Kuro-chan.
Well ex-cuuuse me!
Here we go!
an8Yes, I swear those cat-ears have a life of their own
H-Hey!!
Don't go taking off by yourself, you idiot!
I was hoping to meet you this one time.
You've been doting upon Rin a lot lately.
Do you know things you don't want us to discuss about?
I don't wanna!
Well, it's just like you said. He seems to be really fond of you.
I dunno what I'll do from there.
insert OP-English here
During this summer vacation, may Futatsubashi Elementary continue to embrace the ways of children.
But then it won't be fair to the kids that got good scores.
Isn't measuring personal effort completely subjective on your part?
But, there must be a way to include effort into the grades, however intangiblefscx200-
What do you mean "no way"? Come on, get up.
Yep!
All right then. Do you wanna see me do a handstand?
Be sure you apply yourself to subjects you don't like.
Now I won't have to see that virgin's face anytime soon!
Doing the Second Exercise is a little embarrassing.
That's for sure. That's why you always do the First.
Are you in heat or something?
Oh, thanks for coming!
Um... are you aware?
Kokonoe?
I told you I'd never forgive you if you betrayed me!
The ghost of the cotton candy geezer.
That was huge!
Rin?
But what you're wearing...
Getchu!
I've been tied by the rules and in a fix! I cried my eyes out
That's dangerous, forceful - GO! IN!
fscx87It will totally, surprisingly, and completely attract you, doncha think?
LUCKY I gobbled down your earlobe.

Nuh-uh, no way, I don't want.
I dunno what I'll do from there.
That I'll be.

Yeah, I'm going to see my dad who's working away from home.
Anywhere you play, you are going to make new discoveries.
Teachers must have been easy on us back in my our day, since we got graded on a curve.
Oh? Right now I make use of that method.
I score the tests then divide them into three piles: "excellent", "good", and "fair."
You're still expressing that puerile thinking, Aoki-sensei?
When summer vacation starts, I won't be able to see you.
It'll be all right.
Yep!
All right then. Do you wanna see me do a handstand?
Sensei, bye-bye!
Be sure to help out around the house!
What're you, stupid?
You know, as a kid, I always used to feel let down when summer vacations ended.
Kuro-chan, didn't you just say you wanted an alabaster skin?

Aoki-sensei?
Kokonoe!
Hey, you there! No running!
Are you in heat or something?
They say that your breasts will get bigger if you massage them.
Oh, thanks for coming!
When we're finished here... the two of us could, maybe...
Kokonoe?
Kokonoe...
I can see what goes on from that very spot.
If I don't find those two quick, the fireworks will...
Kokonoe...
Why do you have to be such a problem?
Look, it's getting dark, it's time for you to go home.
No.
Sensei...
Sensei...
What's going on here?
You have to hold me!
I'm home!
I'm fed up, with all my might, I hit C, am Im flying?
Kiss you with love? That's a big NO NO! Adult thinking.

If you're not feeling well, we should stop.
Why did you keep this from me?
Anyways, please don't worry about it!

In your mind, your mother and father aren't really gone.

You look fantastic, and very . . . hand . . . some . . .
Where's my goodbye kiss?

Now my "n" . . .
Rin! You shouldn't be running!
an8Once again, it was a crime to censor her great sideboob during the TV broadcast. It totally ruined the scene.
You need to recover.
I had the doctor estimate the costs.
Yes I have!
Rin, don't make trouble.
At least until she . . .
My Lord, my God.
I dunno what I'll do from there.
If you truly care for me, it will surely lead to
Hmph, do you want to know a good way to handle them?
That goes especially for you two...
Stop that!

What does that teacher think he's doing?
Please alight the...
Okay!
Anyways, who wears that outfit to the mountains?
Now that you mentioned it...
Hey, let me down, you moron!
Say "ahh..."
Yes, nice to meet you all too!
Ah, Sensei...
...we've got some luggages delivered here.
Large baths are really nice!
It's like a cherished tradition.
They'd always hide themselves around here in order to snoop...
At 3:00 at night...
Good, good.
Eh?
The bathroom! Anyways, you'd better take responsibility for that!
K... Kokonoe! Why are you...?
Come on, off you go to your own cabin...
Sensei?
Houin-sensei said so herself.
Only if the kids are actually wearing something!
It's a miss!
So I'll just kiss you warmly.
More, more?
It's so mortifying don't you think?
And you'll come to think that I'm totally adorable.
All you need to do is...
Huh, a parasol?
Listen to what I say, got it?
Hey, kids, quiet down a little!
No, they're wrong! I'm their teacher!
Are we clear?
Okay!
Okay!
an8Nope, she wins this round, lol
I'll be your first, Sensei!
Kokonoe!
No fair! Hold me too!
Oh... Aoki-sensei what are you doing?
We're pleased to meet you, Manager-san!
Every year you Futatsubashi kids are so lively.
Luggages?
Oh!
Those are mine!
I'm sure that one has my negligee and baby doll.
Wh...What are you...?
This counselor thing is tougher than I figured.
Aww, nighttime already?
What are you talking about?
Huh?
This is heaven!
Eh? Where are you guys going?
Hey, wait! Did you at least count to a hundred?
Rin-chan!
Oh, it's cute, it's cute.
No Sabbats!

Eh?
The bathroom! Anyways, you'd better take responsibility for that!
Aoki-sensei, are you in there?
Is... Is there something wrong?
Oh...
Kokonoe! That outfit-
Houin-sensei is sure to believe me.
When I say I'll make noise, that's not the noise I'm talking about.
Wait! Hold on!

Are my constant reactions to her antics the real problem?
Impudent little brat!
Anyway, little girls should not be getting too close to their teachers. Is that clear?
Huh?
K... Kuro-chan?
Kuro-chan, teach me how to make myself up to look boyish.
an8Yes, the only reason she's not in a fancy-pants private school for rich spoiled girls is that they won't allow her to cos-play.
What kind of brand is that one-piece?
I know it's cheap...
Why did I have to be grouped with these girls?
She's not saying anything, is she?
Bingo bango!
I think her words rang true.
The heart and body are connected.
I give out hugs and piggy-back rides every day as a lower-grades teacher

Oh, yes... good morning!
If Rin-chan were really a boy...
Gotcha!

Everybody, we're going to win the sports festival!

You really think you'll beat Class 1?
I wonder if you can run with breasts that big...
Thank you!
Ah, great!
Hey, hey, hey!
Especially with your father being the head of the Board of Education.
I wonder what'll look good on you...
I'm so happy! I'm so excited!
Even if you're slow, I'll make up for it.
Sensei, you didn't even try to molest me!
Coward.
Hey!
Don't be rash!
She was asking for it.
Burn!
And I'll be by his side!
Thank goodness.
What happened?
Such an immature little brat shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff.
Here. Go check it out.
Rin-chan, where'd you go?
Self-confidence...?
Aaah!
Whose fault do you think this is?
It's not okay!
You'll be alright that way.
Don't push yourself...
Why won't it come to the Nichome district?
Nuh-uh, no way, I don't want.
If you spoil me, I'll just take advantage of it.
If you truly care for me, it will surely lead to
We went out to buy and eat ice cream. I really think he's going to get mad at us.
Recently, we've had children sneak out of class during lessons and leave school grounds during breaks.
Why?!
Well I'm glad. I really like books.
Oh, but are you okay with just the two of us?
If you have a boyfriend...
What? I thought you'd be happy.
Oh, right!
Sensei is "it", all right?
Then will you take me to a family restaurant sometime?
Family restaurant?
You're the one that's unbelievable!
I guess this what it means to be left utterly dumbfounded.
You'll receive one warning before I take away your points.
Does Sensei really have a cold?
Now see here!
Rin-chan, wait!
Yeah...
I see.
You don't have tofscx200-
Hmm?
Tastes good, right?
What just happened?
Welcome back!
Aoki-sensei!
Yes. I regret the trouble I caused.
Huh...
I can't resist, I've been dreaming of it ALL NIGHT.
If you listen to me then MAYBE

Mimi-chan's boobs...
Ice cream?! You didn't go wandering off school grounds, did you?
Lucky! I'll be reading mangas.
School is a place of study, right?
You'll also be writing a book report on what you read today.
Rin-chan?
Ko... Kokonoe...!
Huh?

I'm home.
Oh, right!
I guess I'm not that hungry.
What all the racket?!

I guess this what it means to be left utterly dumbfounded.
What exactly are you hiding if you can't defend yourself?
The virgin is great at taking a beating, so he can't possibly succumb to that!
Ah!
Oh...
Ah, how are you!
Aoki-sensei is coming back tomorrow, huh.
I guess so.
He mustn't lose his balance while trying to aim higher.
Mimi-chan, let's go!
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

That's not what I mean!
Hey, Kokonoe!
What about the library card?
Ooh! Looking good!
Huh-
Sensei pays attention to me... only because I'm a kid.
Huh?
Oh, I actually agree.
We could have gone to a ritzier restaurant, you know.
Cuts like these will heal faster if you lick them.
Do you even know what to do on a date ?
Her sexy, adult underwear...
Her abnormally mature speech patterns...
That guy sees Kononoe....
...not as a kid, but as a woman?

Anyone would be perturbed by that!
Oh there he is!
Wh... Why would you think... I'd know about that?
But, Rin-chan is...
It's all pointless.
It's time to hurry back.

Aoki-sensei...
Sorry!
Oh...
Sorry...
I really thought she'd completely gotten over what happened to her.
But...
You still don't have the skills.
Whenever I look at you... I feel uneasy.
Oh, go right ahead.
Aoki-sensei!
I wanna eat them right now.
That's it, right?
Why did the old man thank Hiroko-san?
Yes!
Tell me...
Mm-hmm! Oh...?
Ruuru ni shibatte pinchi! Naitatata
Baby, won't you haaaa . . .
Um, Mom...
I can smell the lie from here.
Me becoming a more honest, gentle girl.
That I'll be.
"Being here..."
Hear what I'm saying.
Hear my voice!
Rin? When did you...?
Team 1A versus Team 2B.
K-Kuro-chan!
Sensei is happy now?
Yeah!
Let go with all we got!
Kagami...
It was all because I got hit right at the start.
Sh... Shut up, please.
So it's already completed?
Reiji... is busy right now.
How come I didn't notice sooner?
Be careful!
Right, I can use my cell...
Hey, watch out!
It's warmer like this, right?
Don't leave me.
She's... hitting the right spot?
Rin, answer me!
You're... shielding this man?
Apologize to Aoki-sensei!
I don't need to!
Stop this instant!
So would you like stuffed cabbages or twice-cooked pork?
For you, right now we'll have our WEDDING.
And a BABY that moves around like me.
Touching and feeling, from my heart to yours...
Look, whatever happens, I'll always love you, Aoki-sensei.
That I'll be.
...who will listen to me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Mimi-chan, are you going to forgive him?
Okay!
I won't lose!
Ko-Kokonoe!
All right, all right!
We're coming, we're coming, we'll come so hard!
It was all because I got hit right at the start.
Being semi-finalists is nothing to sneeze at.
Huh?!
Honestly, what a useless class.
Ugh, you were too slow, Sensei!
I'll see if there any other way out!
Be careful!
Rin... where are you?
Reiji...
You had to be so lightly dressed.
Don't leave me.
Inserting your personal interests into a wholesome children's tournament is no way for a teacher to...
Houin-sensei!
I was testing you.
Is she lonely?
I'm sure we don't need...
Please, let's stay like this for a bit!
If I count prime numbers...
Rin... you're...
No!
protect... Rin!
Reiji...
Please, listen to me! I-
That's dangerous, forceful - GO! IN!
A HEART BEAT that is so loud
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go
More, more?
So is it okay if I touch yours?
It sucks that Rin-chan's off from school.
Today we'll start from page 107.
You still think... Aoki is a masochist?
Yeah, and I can't get her voicemail either.
Right...
Why?
I'm going to head out for a while.
Er... huh?
Are you serious?
A-Anyways, I have the duty to protect Rin.
I will take care of the particulars!
A grown up... huh?
You could have escaped out the window if you wanted to.
Rin!
...san.
He'll be fine.
But...
I understand.
I mean...
Sensei.
I'll be waiting for you too.
Are you dumb?
Kokonoe...
So you're too cool for indirect kisses?
Wait! Rin-chan!
Wait for us!
I'm sure it will continue wherever we go.

an9I want to hurry and keep it girly
an8Ooh, and we end with a cold opening
Oh, it's from Rin-chan!
Aoki-sensei?
S-Sorry.
He must be lonely with Rin-chan's away.
Ew! Ew! Ewww!
But, I'm not very good at that.
So, what do you want to ride?
If you don't want to ride anything, then lets eat.
So what will you have, Rin?
I didn't erase it... and kept it for some reason.
Rin, you must be worn out.
It's best to do what your father says.
Reiji!
an8The seiyuus in the commentary were right. What is she supposed to do if she needs to go to the bathroom?
It's about what happened to Rin-chan.
You see here...
They say if you get mumps as an adult, you'd stop making sperm.
Ah, but if we're talking about Rin-chan... her uterus?
Wh... What are you doing?!
Kuro-chan is better at badmouthing than I am!
Yes. I plan to transfer her immediately.
Yes.
Kokonoe wants to go back to school.
I thought you'd make an escape out the window.
This is...
Rin!
At some point I...
Protect Rin for me.
I want to understand his situation too.
You've taught me a lot, Kokonoe.
But you also taught me that it's never too late to learn.
The virgin only has a flute at best!
And stop your "huhs"!
Houin-sensei?
Thanks for everything, Sensei.
an8Okay, I lied, she's actually saying "your recorder makes a great sound" but since the line was censored in the TV season, I had to dirty it up.
What are you doing, Rin-chan!
Sometimes... there are things we do in a hurry.
But while we rest, and while we stumble
an7I'm all alone twirling my hair
an7See me, just me and want me!
an7Please
Huh, why's that?
Um... maybe we should pick out something soon?
What're you girls doing?
Tadaa!
Please excuse us.
Look, look!
Hurry up and decide so we can play!
We had those soft serves, played that card game...
Kuro-chan, please! Lend me some money!
We... might work something out...
Hey, how about something handmade?
Sounds great, count me in! Somehow, guys can't resist old-fashioned stuff, right?
Yeah!
That's Reiji-san?
Yeah, thanks!
I'm so sorry...
Reiji! We're out of shampoo!
All grown up!
I guess it's a little small...
They're really close, huh?
Good night.
He'd have to seem like big brother to her by now.
And besides... the one Rin-chan loves is...
That's right!
Rin-chan?
i1Obi0viously!
i1Then...i0
Mimi-chan, you're... heavy!
Byeeeee!
Oh?
I'm not telling!
...9... 8...
Why stop at being romantic?
Let's try taking it further
Always make sure to keep it girly

I'll draw a picture and give it to today.
fs24an8When I first heard of this show about a bunch of sex-crazed pre-teens, I was just going to watch the OVA for the lulz. Just another one of those "oh Japan, you infinite source of cheap entertainment" kind of deals.
Hmph, sounds stupid.
Huh? Kuro-chan, what would you do if you got richer than you already are?
Hey, look at this.
It's tomorrow?
That's school property!
Uh-oh.
Um, I'm not sure this is a good present to begin with...
And she's only in grade school!
Brats should be happy with kids' clothing.
We'll be careful from now on, Miss.
What about the present?
Huh, playing it safe, are we?
...Anything?
Then...is it alright if I kiss you?
Mm-hmm...
Yeah! Yeah! I'm in-I'm in! I'm so totally in!
Ow!
I'm home!
She's really that upset...
Now what's that supposed to mean?!
I'm not mad, so don't cry.
Reiji! We're out of shampoo!
Look, look!
Next up: tuna mayo, cucumber, fried tofu and shiso, triple-stuffed!
Rin, you got a little something...
Did everyone call their parents again before bedtime?
Sensei's going to be so happy.
Taisetsu ni sareru to motto
Hey, everyone! Nice to . . .
Yep, looks like.
Do you have a girlfriend?
All right, you start from here.
Kokonoe! Seriously, you did-?
Virgin.
Rin-chan!
Mimi-chan . . .
She's falling even more and more in love!
Rin-chan, time to go!
Sure, I can do that.
Usa, why?
What's wrong? It's almost 7:00.
Why? It's because . . . because of you . . .
Anyways, what are you going to do with your own porno pic?
Whaaa?
What are you doing in that get-up?
Because of my breasts, I'm too noticeable.
No one in our class is wearing a bra yet.
They're so sooft!
You're so lucky, I wanna have this much!
But . . . Rin-chan's . . .
Kagami . . .
I mean, there might be some truth to that.
Eep.
Your present is - little . . . old . . . me.
Hey, what if you made something by hand?
Then it's settled! Now, how about we stay over at my place?
So, they call you Mimi-chan? You look cute with those glasses.
Say, are Rin-chan and Reiji-san a couple or something?
Those girls!
Huh. He's gone.
What do you mean "no way?" Come on, get up.
What's bothering you?
Kokonoe!
What are you doing, Rin-chan?
Kokonoe?
Showing up at school all of a sudden.
Sensei . . .
Sensei . . .
What are you going to do now that you're all wet.
Gotcha!
No you're not. I'll let you borrow my shirt.
Or rather, you got mad after I . . . saw what I just saw.
Even when you're so nice and soft right here!
Are you some geezer?
From now on, I'm going to be much harder on you guys.
Don't bring everyone else into this!
Ko-Kokonoe!
All right, I'll be seeing you later.
Okay!
We can run ten laps, or jump-rope 300 times. Which will it be?
Like . . . I . . . said, those kinds of games are not-
What are you doing? Hurry up, get in!
We've thought of everything. Here, these potato chips will give you stamina.
Your stomach . . . hurts doesn't it?
You can only gain experience step by step.
Thank you.
It sure was close.
You did your best too, right? You did hit someone from the sidelines.
Hmm?
Your heart. It's beating faster and faster.
Aoki-sensei?
School . . .
You're hiding something, aren't you?
Oh you.
I-I knew it! Kuro-chan badmouthing is way better than mine!
Aoki-sensei!
BU! BU! BU!

Okay!
Holy crap!

First, let me hear you explain yourself.
Hey!
Your cough is painful, right?
Thanks for letting in meee!
She's crying because she wants my breasts.
Rin-chan's face is so hot.
Oh, it's getting late. You better head home.
Don't worry, I'll put everything in order.
Shiro-chan, you're not normal?
I have already met that someone.
Avoid my darkness at all costs.
Well...
Rin-chan, you all right?
You reap what you sow!
What are you hiding? Something's going on...
We're doing dodgeball for gym, right?
Yeah. You don't have to try so hard.
You saying it doesn't make me happy at all!
Dashing and majestic...
And this is how I'll do it.

Kagami's in trouble now!

Huh? That sure was lame.
Thanks for letting in meee!
Mimi-chan?
Are you able to eat some food?
She's crying because she wants my breasts.
Huh?
Oh, it's getting late. You better head home.
I'm waiting for Shiro-chan!
Don't worry, I'll put everything in order.
an8I gotta say, those are some dangerous sidewalks.
You said I'll turn normal when I grow up.
When exactly... do you become grown up?
It... it hurts inside.
Hey!
That's not safe.
Your folks must be worried.
an8Yep. Relentlessly depressing.
Someday...
Mimi-chan...
Sorry for being so sudden. I'll see you!
Three cheers for virgins!
Rin-chan, you all right?
Oh, you can use idioms! I'm surprised!
Not your problem!
an8Whatever, clothes can be made to be...
What's that?
Hey, kids! Take your seats!

Be quick and look right over here
Even when I'm with someone
Ohmygawd, you could hear his voice clear from Istanbul!
I was afraid you'd start behaving yourself around him once you became class rep!
Can someone please take it from there?
In any case, the final decision was put off until the next meeting.
Mm-hmm.
"Flap?"
You should really get different glasses!
Yup! When I was in third grade, you substituted for my class, didn't you?
There she is!
You did too, you liar!
I hear that!
But I already ate the cream-filled pastries!
It's for the sports festival!
Come on, Mimi-chan! Let's skip out together!
Grown-ups who always mollycoddle kids are the worst!
So I was thinking what if we all had lunch together.
Your father also said so himself.
It's a Shirai-sensei.
Now even the principal will have to listen to my opinions!
Everybody, a good morning to you.
Fight!
You little...! You little...!
Must perform mouth-to-mouth!
Will I meet you tomorrow? Yes you will!
One, two, three of my own
I'm sorry Aoki-sensei!
I want to close the gap between us
I hold my loss within my hand
Here, Rin-chan!
an8I like her because she kicks ass, takes names and is gay for Rin. But they really made her into a puppy dog this time around. Not that I didn't expect it since the chapter it was based on didn't exactly jazz me.
Although, speaking of being a goody-good, I'm starting to miss how he'd yell out "Kokonoe!"
...but you can call me Kuro-chan!
Yup! When I was in third grade, you substituted for my class, didn't you?
She called her "Shiro-chan!"
Shirai-sensei, I'm begging you! Tell me your secret!
No way! Tell me!
I just loathe that guy!
Since you are Shiro-chan, you get a white rose! 
Didja hear? Both of that girl's parents are teachers at this school!
I just came to fetch my documents.
But I already ate the cream-filled pastries!
an8Sorry, there wasn't enough room to write "super-stupid game that even the Special Olympics won't consider where a bunch of kids throw colored balls into a basket on top of a pole" so I just went with the Japanese name, Tama-ire.
Hey, Kuro-chan, sign up!
It's for the sports festival!
They're so stupid! They're so retarded!
Eh?
Huh?
I've heard that Fujimori-san's daughter, Chika-chan, is getting married!
So I was thinking what if we all had lunch together.
What's with that look you got on?
Everybody, a good morning to you.
What the heck?
Kuro-chan!
Aoki-sensei!
Even though Monday and every day of the week is Sunday
Really? Then I just can't wait!
I won't let you get away!

Sensei's a perv!
You there! No pictures!
Just writing "hope" would be soo boring!
No way! Aoki-sensei, you're really still a virgin?
S-Sorry!
The same . . . things?
Mimi-chan wasn't the only one victimized by Nakamura.
"But it's a video."
Kokonoe!
Rin-chan, time to go!
If you don't understand this here you won't be able to solve the other problems.
Sure, I can do that.
Have sex with me.
There you go again, saying things you don't understand-
Here!
Here!
Aww, and it's all Sensei's fault!
Sensei.
You know, you did very well on that test.
Kokonoe.
I thought you hated me.
Yep.
Even if I touch your wee-wee?
You're not gonna to do that, are you?
It's because you're the adorable student in our class.
It hurts!
Do you want some too?
Psyche!
Mimi-chan.
It'll be all right, I'll hunch over wherever I go, and wear patterned shirts. It won't be so bad.
Since we're here, we might as well get a complete set.
They're so sooft!
All right, now's my chance!
Ahh! Sorry!
You need to do a written essay about your mother or your father.
Here, pass these behind you.
What's with you, Rin-chan?
Where didja put your head this morning?
Rin, that's very rude.
But . . .
I don't wanna!
I thank you for your time.
Really?
Eep.
Ow!
Welcome back! You're home early.
I'll clean up over here, you'll need to take a bath.
Be sure not to cut your hand.
Can she just behave . . .
Sensei!
Even during summer vacation, I'll still be coming to school.
Sure.
I mean, at the festival, there will be a lot of kids, and they'll need patrols . . .
You told me I could come whenever I want.
Sensei . . .
I can always stay here.
That's stupid. You'll catch a cold-
You could have borrowed the one from Hoin-sensei.
No you're not. I'll let you borrow my shirt.
Ah, hey!
I guess you got mad after I said little girls shouldn't get too close.
Rin . . . Rin?!
No way! Of course I don't have a boyfriend!
What are you doing? Hurry up, get in!
Ah! You kids!
Only if you give me a kiss.
It is because there is a problem with her we called you here in the first place.
You guys!
Oh no you don't! You must eat something.
Oh, I forgot the avocado dip!
Sensei.
It's not your fault.
Thanks a lot, Hoin-sensei.
Sensei! Here's the library card.
You do your best looking out for me for the sake of the other kids.
Sensei also won't pay attention to me . . . just because I'm a kid.
Can you help me?
You're just super-pissed that I barged in on your date with Hoin-sensei.
That's how you do it. If everybody were kind to each other, wars and the like would come to an end.
Hating is wrong.
If you hate, you'll only suffer needlessly.
What about you, Aki-san? Did you forgive him?
Rin? When did you-?
Oh . . . crap!
All right!
Rin-chan, nice!
Huh? What's a masochist?
It's pretty cold, would you like it if I catch a cold?
And I was wondering if you hated me again.
Kokonoe!
Shit or get off the can!!
Thanks a lot.
. . . what are you going to do with that?
I understand.
You have taught me a lot.
Aoki-sensei . . .
I'll be waiting for you too.
Is an indirect kiss not as good as the real thing?
See ya, Aoki-sensei!

Horrible things?
I like cats.
At home, there's an old cat that I feed.
She even made it bleed more.
Hey, don't run!
Eh?
What do you think you're writing!?
Aoki-sensei.
They really are annoying, impudent, and adult-like.
Eh?
Eh?
I will never let anyone hurt Mimi-chan ever again.
Nyah...alphaHFF are you alright?
Nyah... are you alright?
Adults are always doing horrible things without hesitation.
I heard that you're very smart.
Your grades are all A's right?
Yes.
Well, it's about time to go.
So, I wanted to meet you too, Aoki-sensei.
Kokonoe!
Rin-chan!
Aoki-sensei is a good person.
No no, I was happy it was you.
Here's a present for saving me!
be1Good, good.
be1Sensei!
be1K-Kuro-chan!
be1It's really bad, I go home on the last train every day.
be1What? A cute, cheeky, female teacher? And she's even erotic?! What's this? Tell us more!
be1Don't you say you've "done it your way."
be1Ah, I can't. Aoki-sensei said he has a private lesson for me.
be1Good morning!
be1Sensei! I don't understand it at all!
be1Sensei is trying hard.
be1Let's see... I want to divide 64 marble with 8 students.
be1It's for Aoki-sensei's sake not to say anything, but I'm concerned about him.
be1Isn't it amazing?
be1Oh, thank you.
be1Sit down.
be1Children are always reluctant, as I imagined.
be1I associate textbooks with school.
be1and I associate...
be1Yay!
be1You're great! You can do it!
be1Yes...that's right.
be1Turn left on this corner.
be1Kokonoe, thanks a lot.
be1Because you, helped me...
be1Why would I hate you?
be1I didn't do that.
be1Here, lovely!
be1Huh!?
be1Sending now!
be1Try to keep a low profile on it.
be1In the third grade, stuff like this is normal.
be1Usa!?
be1What if I ask Kokonoe for help? Wait, why should I rely on a child?
be1What's wrong?
be1Here, I'll give you this so cheer up.
be1My indirect kiss!
be1Hey, what's wrong? Kagami.
be1No, wait, how are you going to...

be1Rin.
be1Eh? I have to take off my panties too?
be1like wearing a bra, one person will have to hold up your breasts, while the other takes the measurements.
be1Rin-chan, that tickles...
be1It's just not right...
be1A-Aoki-sensei.
be1It's itchy, because they're growing.
be1You know...
be1Yeah, I'm going to visit my father.
be1I'm busy right now, we'll talk later!
be1Be bright, carefree, ambitious...
be1Yeah.
be1I thought they weren't something I'd have to worry about.
be1But sometimes there's an effort that you can't see, that's why it's worth grad-
be1Because of that mindset, children pretend to be good in front of teachers.
be1Kokonoe.
be1It's okay.
be1Wait! Skirt!
be1Don't stay up too late.
be1Oh, I'm so happy.
be1Mimi-chan, can you get the sunscreen for me?
be1Okay.
be1Rin-chan!
be1I... I see...
be1Kokonoe.
be1What are you doing, Rin-chan?
be1Um, did you know?
be1I think we should go patrol it.
be1After we finish here... Um...
be1Look!
be1The fireworks will start soon...
be1Kokonoe!
be1Sensei...
be1What are we supposed to do now, wet like this?
be1Tamaya!
be1It's kind of strange, isn't it?
be1Even so, what's with the outfits?
I hope he's cute!
He'd better not show up looking dorky in the same color suit and tie.
And you'll come to think that I'm totally adorable.
Really?
Thank you very much...
She's been absent for the past month.
Later, he called us saying that he wants to quit.
Oh?
They hurt others without any remorse. And they do cruel stuff with no regret.
Oh...
What's with the racket this time?!
I-I'm deeply sorry!
Are you sure... a student in my class did this?
Aoki-sensei, I want you to deal with your students knowing everything.
Uh, thanks. If it's all right with you, I like to speak with the child alone.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah!
It's ok for me to look?
A sweet roll?
R-Rin-chan!
It doesn't seem right for me to pass judgment on events that happened before I was even here.
Don't look down!
I'll get the ladder!
Aoki-sensei?
Aoki-sensei!
Sensei!!
"It will be all right with Aoki-sensei."
Don't sweat it.
I'm actually glad it was you I took care of.
Huh?
Sensei!
This is our thanks for saving me!
Ready... set ...
That's dangerous, forceful - GO! IN!
I'm sure, my words won't reach you.
If you wanna taste, go ahead and try it on the fly

be1You don't have anyone left here, do you?
be1Wait, Rin!
be1How is it?! How is it?!
be1You're right.
be1N-None.
be1I'll be late today too,
be1so can you take Rin home today?
be1Around three, right?
be1You adopt me, right?
be1I'll find a job that will fit with my schedule!
be1Are you okay?
be1Fine!
be1Your illness isn't pneumonia at all.
be1It's stage two cancer.
be1Reiji.
be1Eh?
be1Not fair, I want a hug too!
be1You'll recover soon.

I'm-
I'm truly sorry!
Oh...
Haaa...
Ohhh-
Oh?
HAAAAA!!!
Sensei, pai pai!
He was certainly annoying and ignorant...
Go to hell!
I'm just repeating the same words that Nakamura-sensei said!
The things he said to Mimi-chan.
I guess that's it for you...
I had to wait for a long time!
Oh!

Geez, that child...
Well, if possible, can I be alone with her?
Well...

...to believe in me?
Ah!
I'm allowed to look at it?
i1But...i0
Ah!
Oh...
I won't explain the minor details, but first, just try it.
Ri- Rin-chan!
Th-
Oh?
What are you doin-
Kokonoe don't move!
KOKONOEEE!!!
Oh!
Aoki-sensei?
If it's with Aoki-sensei, I'll be fine.
Oh...
fnComic Sans MSfs34I may listen to what you say,
fnComic Sans MSfs34Just love by itself is not enough. With my adult mind
kitto kotoba ja tsutawaranai nukumori kisushite yo!
fnComic Sans MSfs34That will give your nervous heart a great smile, bun bun bun!
Baby, want you haaa
It seems like Aoki-sensei is worried about something...
fnComic Sans MSfs34I'll show you why
kanchigai no doujou yada yada iranai
amayakaso tsukeagaru to ka atama katai ne wakattenai
fnComic Sans MSfs34that's right, for you
The theme will be dreams.
The world is in despair. Society is already trash.
Oh...
Not really weak, but...
That's different than love between friends!
Oh!
A cute, ignorant, problem causing, erotic teacher!?
Ah, no!
Once you do it with them one time, those types of girls are yours for good.
As expected of a guy who already lost his virginity in 6th grade!
I don't understand at all.
Alright, my motivation came!
Oh my, look.
But I have my own way-
It's bad to have your own way.
Ah, I can't.
Sensei is going to teach me, so I have to stay.
Ohhh!
Eh-
You'll feel bad for sensei if you go that far.
Sensei, please continue already.
Oh, an ammonite?
Ohhh, Kagami?
It's the composition.
Saved by Kokonoe?
You really haven't noticed.
Take your seats!
Yes
You did well.
Usa, why!?
Ehhh!?
It's almost 7.
Turn right around this corner.
Here, turn left.
Because, you...
Sensei, even if I touched your thing?
Later!
Bye-bye!
Oh!
No...
fnComic Sans MSfs34I wonder if you saw C flying after bumping and scrambling?
fnComic Sans MSfs34I may listen to what you say,
Baby, want you haaa
kimi no tame da nandoyu kedo
fnComic Sans MSfs34...that's a stinkin' lie!
AH!
Hey, what are you doing with your own erotic picture anyway?
Ahhh!
Hm?
If you don't put anything on, you'll catch a col-
Gather up!
A...
Eh...
Brea-
Breasts!?
Yes!
Breasts don't matter...
Doesn't...
Is Kuro-chan feeling kinda bad today?
Hmmmm...
That's true.
Ah!
AHHHH!
GAAAAAHHHHH!!!
With that, sensei is on the same level now!
Oh!
Shouldn't you wear a bra soon?
If I just wear an undershirt, I won't stand out...
AHHH!
Rin-chan!
As expected from her bust!
Oh!
At a supermarket...
By yourself?
My mom gave me money.
The size doesn't match at all.
But that was only 3000 yen...
Ohhh!
Could I borrow a ruler?
To measure someone's bust properly, you have to know the exact size...
B- But...
With this opening!
It would be too embarassing!
It's almost summer, eh?
That's just like a shellfish.
Eh!?
Ah...
It can't be helped.
Kokonoe!
You still haven't...
See, I did something, right?
Argh!
I'm sorry!!

Ha!
There are a lot of schools which don't have house visits anymore.
Haaa...
Hey!
Yeah, let's go.
AHHH!!!
OH!
We're going to use the pool tomorrow!
After the pool, we're going to have a class.
I was an idiot for being happy with that...
Don't run away like a loony!
Hey!
What are you doing, Rin-chan?
I'm going to the toilet.
Usa, Kagami.
Haaaaaaaaaa!?
It's not for me, it's for Kokonoe!
Hm...
Aoki-sensei...
Figure it out on your own!
K- Kagami!
H- Heeeey!
Eh!?
Ahhh, no!
Okay...
Sorry if it sounds rude, but as a homeroom teacher, I want to know about the details.
I lost my parents due to an accident 4 years ago.
At that time, Rin's mother who just got divorced, took me in.
Right...
Why are you here!?
Th- That's not true at all...
Sorry for the disturbance.
Goodbye, Kokonoe.

Oh?
Why?

fnComic Sans MSfs34naturally
Don't ignore me!
AHHHHHHH!
What!?
Whether they try hard or not has no meaning for merit.
But the effort that isn't seen should be taken into consideration-
We are the teachers!
Eh?
The bell rang already.
Even during summer vacation, sensei will be coming to school.
Yeah!
Sensei, you pevert!!!
Okay!
Kagami!
You're a kid that can do it if you want!
You're too obvious!
If you cheat on me, I won't forgive you!
I always felt sad when summer vacation was ending.
Geez, what is it, Kuro-chan?
Hurry...
Hurry!
I've been playing with Kuro-chan and Mimi-chan anyway.
Is-
Oh!
Oh...
Sensei, goodbye.
...any day...
I think it's necessary!
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Look!
Yes, Kokonoe!
You said...
Eh?
Sensei
Kokonoe...
Haaa...
You can't go-
You're wrong!
Ah-
You...
Eh!?
It's fine!
Just because of that, your clothes...
fnComic Sans MSfs34I may listen to what you say,
fnComic Sans MSfs34I'm definate that words cannot describe this hot feeling when you kiss me!

fnComic Sans MSfs34It'll happen,

Why don't you move to your cousin who's living in Tokyo?
Ah!
Is it cute?
Oh!
He told me...
I'll prepare dinner, so you can have some when you get back.
Hey Rin, haaaave a safe triiiip!
Oh...
What, what!?
Oh!
What's wrong!?
Hey, hey, Rin, you, too!
Have a safe trip.
Mhm...
...to slow down the process as much as possible.
Reiji, use it for something you'd like!
Besides...
Ah!
Ah!
Awa...
...protect Rin?
I don't want to!
Not just Rin...
I shouldn't have forced you to go with us.
No
That's fine.

AH!
The things my feelings cannot say
I will never forget about it...
fnComic Sans MSfs34...that's a stinkin' lie!
Oh...
Funny?
...how are I supposed to do it...
Hmhm!
What!? An umbrella?
Oh?
Got it?
Oookaaay!
Hey guys!
Geez...
Kokonoe!
OH!?
I'm the teacher!
I feel so at ease!
First of all, we're going to the mountains and what's up with those clothes!?
Why do you need an umbrella?
A virgin will neeeeever give me orders!
No
What is it, Usa?
Ah!
Eh?
Carry me, tooooo!!!
Sensei...
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Please, return them all.
Hmmm...
Ah-
Just a feeling...
Hm?
Oh?
Kuro-chan?
Waaaaait!
Haaa!
Ah!

Come on, get up!
But he didn't even let me in his room...

HAAA!?
Were you lonely without me?
HEY!
Sensei!
i1Oh?i0
Not fair!
Hey, hey, Rin-chan!
She even told me to bring make-up with me...
K-
Wait, Kuro-chan, are you okay with that?
Just add some random last name.
Ah!
Apologize to her!
This is bad!
Kokonoe...
i1...cry...i0
It's fine!
Didn't you know?
Ah!
Ma-
Is-
I'm glad...
What was Nogi-sensei thinking when she told you that?
I think it's a good idea.
I...
It doesn't seem, you have been hugged a lot.

Oh...
Hurry up, hurry up! Lunch break is almost over!

God!
Kuro-chan, you are so perverted!
What are you doing?
Don't tell me, you sneaked out of school again!?
HA!?
Kokonoe!
Then, sensei
Ah...
If I'm forced to read a boring book, that might as well be something that some common-
Argh! This became something amazing!
You're early.
I suppose I didn't spend much energy today.
Aren't you tired?
Hmpf!
Will you take me to a restaurant?
Don't be stupid and hurry!
H-
Hey, Kokonoe!
Kokonoe!
Shirai-sensei...
U- U- Uh...
Ahahaaa, I'm so tired!
Oh...
HA!
Don't avoid the problem!
Recyclable garbage!
Usable...
Ah, uhm...
Who knows...
Skill is necessary for it to work well.
He must take things seriously!
Mimi-chan, let's go!
Ahhh!
I- I see, uhm, but... Yeah, it can be used!
O- Oh- Oh...
Then, it's time for the children to go home.
This is the report of the yesterday's class.
Yes!
What!?
fnComic Sans MSfs34No, I cannot wait 10 years for love
fnComic Sans MSfs34I'm going to be dangerous and force myself to go in!
fnComic Sans MSfs34The world is going round as the scenery changes, but for now...
I want to clean each one of them and see you happy...
He'd better not show up wearing the same color suit and tie. Only a total dork would have that look!
you . . .
Yep, looks like.
a6Nice smile there.
OP
Should we do it?
That's for me . . .
If you spoil me, I'll just take advantage of it.
Me becoming a more honest, gentle girl.
Uh, from this day forward, I will be Class One's homeroom teacher, Aoki Daisuke.
That's n-
What on earth are you doing, Aoki-sensei? We can hear you from all the way upstairs!
Actually, it was one of the events that led the former teacher, Nakamura-sensei, to eventually quit.
Don't put him out.
a6So how much time must pass before we can safely say he's actually enjoying it?
All right, you start from here.
The same . . . things?
Virgin.
Mimi-chan wasn't the only one victimized by Nakamura.
If you ever reveal this to anyone, I'll do you like we did Nakamura.
Ah, wait up!
You don't know where that finger has been. It's unclean, you'll get cooties and become the class reject.
Ah, I apologize for you needing to come here. Honestly, that girl . . .
 . . . going to believe me?
It must have been hard on you.
It's this.
Uh-huh.
That's why I kind of wanted to meet you, Aoki-sensei.
V-virgin?
Rin-chan!
I have to save him.
Yeah.
You'll do that for me?
Uh . . . do we have to do it too?
Getchu!
If you listen to me then MAYBE
And a BABY that moves around like me.
It will totally, surprisingly, and completely attract you, doncha think?
Heart racing, I get a flower on my test, smile and go

Ohhh!
What's wrong?
Rin-chan...
Reiji-san!?
Ohhh?
It's fine.
Right now we're serving a child size soft-cream ice.
Actually, I don't want any.
Rin-chan!?
Let me see your leg.
Even with that, am I a child?
Ah!
Why do you avert your eyes?
That's not the problem!
Liar
Hey, you!
If that's the case...
Ah...
Hm?
I've caused you trouble again...
Hm...
All the other students, too...
You have to gain experience with them slowly.
Seriously...
It worries me...
Ahhh!
AHHH!!!
Pi- Pickles!?
I forgot the dressing!
Ohhh, then...
What's wrong?
Hm?
...make someone like me?
Ah!
Alright!
I'll work hard, too!

Oh...
They don't look alike at all...
Hm!
Argh!
Wait!
A person who likes to get made fun of and being hit.
HEY!
Meh...

You know...
Aoki being a masochist...
Haaa...
Oh!
What are you doing!?
Why!?
HAAA!
Reiji!
Kuro-chan...
Haaa...
About Kokonoe?
Wh-
Because...
They say, when you became an adult, you would die from suffocation.
Any-
And you're forc-
YOU!
It's a critical moment, Aoki-sensei.
When have I...
Rin!
So selfishly!?
RIN!

i1Ah!i0
i1Ah...i0
Uh-
It's so normal that it's boring.
Then, again...
Tightly...
...the first person I could believe in.
Oh!
Kokonoe!
Good God...
I'm truly sorry!
Aki-san...
No...
Are you saying that Shirai-sensei is my rival!?
Hm?
Sensei
make you smile everyday.

I'll overcome a thousand obstacles to see you.
I'll force you to let me be girly, please, let me.
When did you take my-
You!
Ah-
Hu!?
We would get trapped...
...I'm sure...
A kind, older brother type teacher.
Hey hey, I wonder what our new teacher is going to be like!
Was that our new teacher?
Ehh, starting today, I will be teaching you.
First off, in order to help me remember your faces, I'll call your names.
Here
Here! Here! Here!
Huh?!
We could hear you all they way upstairs.
Class 1 is the noisiest.
Is she in the hospital? Or-
Usa Mimi...
Don't chase him away.
His name was Kotatsu, because he liked kotatsus.
Here!
I-I'm so sorry!
I was hesitant too.
Don't come to school.
So, that's your attitude towards it.
If I screamed for help here...
You're late!
Virgin, Mimi-chan wasn't the only one teased by Nakamura.
Oh, I'm so sorry that you had to go out of your way to come here.
No, that's alright. If possible, I would like to talk her alone.
This isn't the way.
I don't understand.
A kind and gentle side that takes care of friends.
Which one is their real self?
We are doing an experiment today! An experiment!
Air cannons!
Is it here?
T-There!
Kokonoe!
Aoki-sensei...
...and two tails.
I feel sorry for him. He's been teased.
Okay!
Here's a present for saving me!
Today I want to start out as a friendly, kind, Onii-san like teacher.
Let's go!
Everybody! It's a pleasure... to... meet...
Was that...just him?
Should we investigate a little to find out?
Everybody, please take good care of me.
Idai Seto.
Is that right?
Here! Here! Here!
Thank you very much.
After a while he came back and resigned.
Do this part like this.
Just writing "Hope" isn't fun.
W-What is it?
Die.
B-But...alphaHFF even so... you didn't need to hound him until he got sick.
Kuro-chan?
I will never let anyone hurt Mimi-chan ever again.
Sorry about scaring you earlier.
No, that's alright. If possible, I would like to talk her alone.
"No."
I don't understand.
And a cruel side that harasses adults to no end.
Yeah, I...
Is it here?
I think it would be unfair for someone like me, who wasn't there, to judge what has already happened.
But if I still needed to make a decision, I would...
I need to save him...
Come on, Nyah. It's ok.
No, Sensei, Sensei!
If I don't save him... There are nice people too...
Mimi-chan.
Because, Sensei already saw me naked.
His teaching hit a wall too.
I don't do such things.
If this stroke doesn't start here, it won't be able to connect with the next stroke.
What's going on this time!?
an8Translator's Note: "Pai Pai" is a childish word for breast.
This is a textbook that Nakamura-sensei was using.
I've already talked to the principal.
But I didn't want to hide it.
Mimi!
No, that's alright. If possible, I would like to talk her alone.
"No."
Well, can you come back to school soon?
"No, not with these words."
Eh?
Adults didn't understand her, whether they were teachers or parents.
Well, it's about time to go.
Is it ok for me to look?
But...
Good morning, Mimi-chan.
Is it here?
You shouldn't climb up there!
Rin-chan, I'll go get a teacher!
SENSEI!!!
He's just asleep.
I'm very sorry to have bothered you.
Eh? Really?
Here's a present for saving me!
I really don't want to do it...
One, two...!
Let's go!
Ehh, starting today, I will be teaching you.
She's been absent this entire month.
Eh?
It's bleeding.
Class is about to start.
The bleeding didn't stop.
But...
Just writing "Hope" isn't fun.
"Why didn't you come to school?" "Everything is your fault."
I won't do it for him anymore.
Rin-chan.
Adults didn't understand her, whether they were teachers or parents.
This...
And a cruel side that harasses adults to no end.
Nyah?
Kokonoe.
Usa and Nyah aren't the only ones,
who don't trust other people...
Aoki-sensei told me that he believes me.
Aoki-sensei is a good person.
Hin-sensei said to get back to class quickly!
Thank you, Sensei.
No no, I was happy it was you.
Oh yeah, do you want to eat together?
be1The topic is "dreams", you all have dreams, don't you?
be1You can!
be1Kuro-chan...?
be1K-Kuro-chan!
be1It's really bad, I go home on the last train every day.
be1But...there's a cute...
be1This is Kokonoe's composition.
be1A delicious meal filled with energy and vitality. At night, I want to wash sensei!
be1That's good, I got motivated! I'll read some more compositions!
be1I'm very sorry.
be1Yes, I'll give you something.
be1Explain it easier.
be1Sensei, why don't you go ahead?
be1I associate textbooks with school.
be1I heard the results of the exam.
be1Let's go drink to celebrate.
be1Kokonoe, thanks a lot.
be1Why?
be1I thought you hated me.
be1You didn't, right?
be1Even if I made the ex-teacher leave the school?
be1Right, what you've done is a bad thing.
be1That is, you're a cute student of mine, so..
be1A teacher?
be1Are these breasts just for decoration?
be1NO!!
be1Today's lesson will be composition exercises.
be1Do you really think we have dreams?
be1Today's society is depressing and the politicians are useless.
be1I'm different!
be1K-Kuro-chan...
be1I envy you Aoki. It's probably really easy being an elementary school teacher.
be1That's great! Such a man who lost his virginity in 6th grade.
be1I don't understand it at all.
be1My dream is to be an animal doctor.
be1I need to do something.
be1You're not going to be rewarded even if you fall in love with a teacher!
be1If she was a boy, we couldn't go to the restroom together, and we'd be teased when we play together.
be1What?
be1Rin-chan...
be1Yes.
be1This is a diary.
be1and I associate...
be1Yes!
be1Yes!
be1Kokonoe!
be1Then...
be1Sure...
be1Yes.
be1Right, what you've done is a bad thing.
be1Of course...
be1Today, someone at school said to me, "I love you".
be1Here, lovely!
be1Let's do it together.
be1S-Sensei
be1For a man like me, I can't just say, "Wear a bra."
be1Aoki-sensei, come over here.
be1Oh, okay.
be1R-Really?
be1It's Rin-chan's.
be1It's okay if it's indirect.
be1Hey, that isn't allowed in here.
be1Rushing in with only underwear on...
be1Here.
be1That candy tastes the same as my lips.
be1U-Usa, what's wrong?
be1Oh ya, Kagami was reading this.
be1They read stuff like this?
be1Rin-chan.
be1What are you guys doing?
be1It's tight, it's painful, it's better not to wear it.
be1You need to measure yourself correctly when buying a bra.
be1Mimi-chan, let me borrow that bra for a bit.
be1Kagami-sama, welcome.
be1To measure the bust size correctly,
be1No, that's too different from my personality.
be1"The road that mid-level grade school teacher walks is a beastly road."
be1Speaking of beastly.
be1I wonder if he has anything against the owner.
be1He might be acting this way because his teeth are itchy.
be1Alright, I'll do something for Mimi-chan.
Yada yada iranai.
Ato wa doushiyo?
The theme is "dreams." Everyone must have one or two things they want to be.
That's just not true!
Se-n-sei!
God, the pits! Every day the last train!
That's bull!
Then you're off to off-campus training, where you attend conferences on instructional sciences.
Man, did I drink.
All right, got my motivation back!
Let's go another round, shall we?
Or rather, let's see him suffer like we did.
You were always so good at math.
There must be a problem with the way you teach, am I right?
If you don't understand this here you won't be able to solve the other problems.
Cool, ain't it? I got some more at home.
Heh, and he had no clue.
Really, just pathetic.
All right, noon break is over! Take your seats!
Open your textbooks to page 18.
You all have already learned how to use the symbols on a map.
That's amazing, Kokonoe! I knew you can do it if you try hard enough.
Sensei!
What are they, stupid or something?
Ah! Wait...
You know, you did very well on that test.
Right.
Even if I say mean things to you?
Even if I eat it?
Even if I forced my old teacher to resign?
Eh... huh?!

be1Yeah, yeah, that's it!
be1he won't be able to talk for more than 15 minutes per visit.
be1Oh, Aoki-sensei.
be1You'll figure it out by yourself,
be1B-But...
be1Uuah! Already so impertinent!
be1Ah! Really?
be1What's wrong?
be1Can you carry me to class?
be1Okay
be1You've done a great job writing about your guardian.
be1I can see your legs!
be1Sensei.
be1Wa-
be1Koko-
be1How can I fix this?
be1Kuro-chan's gym uniform is really loose!
be1Oh! It's the one I had from the first year.
be1Don't leave without me, okay?
be1Can I speak with you two for a moment?
be1But...
be1It's not for me!
be1But Kokonoe has lived through so many hardships until now...
be1Hey! Kagami!
be1All I want is to be by Rin's side forever!
be1Rin-chan!
be1In that case...
be1Nice house...
be1and warm.
be1Well...
be1and Rin's mother adopted me.

be1I understand that.
be1You've grown up, Aoki-sensei.
be1W-What was that feeling, just then?
be1It's our duty.
be1No, I was talking about Shirai-sensei.
be1Why have you been so capricious since this morning?
be1Silly... Something like that?
be1Really?
be1Wait! Skirt!
be1Be sure to work harder next semester.
be1Sensei, bye-bye.
be1What are you doing, Kuro-chan?
be1It's so boring.
be1Over summer break, I have to study hard and become more knowledgeable.
be1That's cheating!
be1Goodbye, Sensei.
be1Let's finish here.
be1There's a fireworks display at a nearby park tonight.
be1Aoki-sensei?
be1They're breezier.
be1Rin-chan!
be1Like suddenly coming to school?
be1But like this...
be1If you don't hurry back...
be1What are we supposed to do now, wet like this?
be1It's okay if we don't go back.
be1You'll catch a cold.
be1It's very pretty, Kuro-chan.
be1I feel misunderstood.
be1What's wrong? You were such a good boy!
be1It's been a while!
be1You're right.
be1Here's your lunch!
be1Well, you've been here for so long, I thought it would be nice to make it official.
be1It's a little...
be1No, no, I'm sorry for suggesting it.
be1Rin...
be1Ahaha! I can see it!
be1Fine!
be1It's stage two cancer.
be1A bonus?
be1Where is mom's room ?
be1Let's go home.
be1I could live until...
be1Rin.
be1Aki-san...
be1Mmmm, Delicious!
be1Let's see, a charm that will make you smart...

be1Hey, hey! It's okay if everyone sleeps over tonight isn't it?
be1Did you ask their parents?
be1Then it's all right.
be1They call you Mimi-chan? You're such a cute girl with glasses...
be1Any progress?
be1Don't get so down.
be1Yeah, it was all sloppy before anyway.
be1Rin...chan
be1Huh?
be1H-Hey! Wait!
be1Mimi-chan look.
be1It's a little small isn't it?
be1Next is tsunamayo and cucumber with fried-tofu and shiso, times three!
be1Ah...
be1Also, the person that Rin-chan loves is--
be1Mimi-chan, you're heavy!
be1He will...
be1Ah, he disappeared.

Come on... take a sip.

Really, is that all?
Because of my breasts, I'm too noticeable.
It'll be all right.

You'll do that?

Kiss you with love? That's a big NO NO! Adult thinking.
If you wanna taste, go ahead and try it on the fly
It's a love letter!
I'm going to give it to Aoki-sensei.
R-Rin-chan, you are being too rough.

Wow! Mimi-chan is so extra squeezy!
Speaking of beasts . . .
But when the body grows, so do the teeth, right?
Well tonight we'll let loose!
Sensei, you've been obsessing over Mimi-chan's breasts?

We have nothing on it or similar aliens in our database.
Those engineers didn't think much about the pilots...
These weird clothes don't feel good.
It's too early to switch pitchers.
Losing the EX-1?
It's a contingency plan, our insurance...
No way!

You kill Maki just like that...

Take over a while, would you?
It's okay now.

The EX-1 keeps it busy while we get close.
The signal won't reach.
It's tea time.
I'm sorry.
Fire!
How's the analysis?
I'm not ready to die.
It's working.
How do you know that?

Along with a very threatening letter.
We don't know who to plug.
or if there is even a 1 percent probability of it causing harm to civilians,
In any event...
These military brass are missing the big picture.
I've analyzed the EX-1's individual parts and how they each move.
Where's Harriet?
It's all going as planned.
Your existence is the only miscalculation.
Youre just a heap of scars!

You mean for the Excalibur?
No good, sir.
It's an extra reserve of power.

The monsters should just kill each other.
We humans aren't in their league.
The same thing as everyone else.

Wait, Commander...
On behalf of all of us...
Lt. Simmons and I have already lost a lot of comrades in this war.
That this is a fight for our existence?
I see.
Huh?
You and me, let's sink together.
You might die, you know.
The target is within visual range.
Discharging bolt at 22.7 gigawatts.
...the world's largest charged particle accelerator, Fefnir.
Gravitational change confirmed at point of impact.
Yes, ma'am, we're okay.
Stay away from Hattie!
i1fs32Where babbling brooks babble, and dragonflies fly.
I don't care. Prepare to fire.
The target's outside guidance range.
But we have to get around its gravitational shifts.
It's over, Maki...
Impossible.
Mr. Fairy...
Frank saved you, didn't he?
Saved me?
You can do it, everyone...
Spread out!
You did a good job.
I see... I found it!
At each stage, accuracy was near perfectly in line with projections.
...that we're working hard to fight off the aliens.
The next report, please.
Recognized.
Isn't it more reasonable to assume the base was merely in its way...
So it's not scientific to say they're all converging at the Pilgrimage Point?
so a more accurate term should...
How do you explain that?
So we have to conclude that the aliens, until they reached Earth,
wouldn't have any information about the Earth.
Which only logically leads to one theory.
That's a self-serving analysis of the situation.
Its just frustrating.
I was just thinking about that fight with the alien the other day.
as long as it's our duty, we must go and fight the aliens.
...but let them go where they want and find out what they're up to?
But what I'd like us all to keep in mind...
we've analyzed the soil composition, air, radiation levels,
If we give the military free reign, you'll snatch up all the budget...
The scope of this issue extends beyond that of a simple turf war.
Whatever you do, you're still a woman.
I don't know much about the Funeral organization...
...but it seems most of your pilots are very young.
No, I just thought so when I looked at you.
Please, return the hard copies.
When you realize how fragile it is,
Trouble is, once it's well enough to go out on its own,
and the other you in you.
Isn't that right, Takuto Kaneshiro?
Now that you mention it, he doesn't eat, does he?
The death will come belated.
Who are you?
We've been ordered on standby.
Somehow, I ended up helping...
Besides, do you think you've got a magic wand to fix all this junk?
But, but, but...
Mr. Fairy, hurry up and wake up!
Saying that won't get it done.
So we've only got one SARG.
You know why?
Move the EX-1?
I'm told they've built a new facility for reviving him.
If that's the case...
My SARG is the only one still functioning.
Lt. Soma?
I meant can we trust him with the EX-1?
He sure seems to affect you, doesn't he?
Hey, hey, hey.
Unknown object approaching.
Nothing here.
But we can still fly.
Repeat, SARG 5, please respond!

Understood.
Can you send the battle log?
Roger.
You must have heard.
I still say D-22's the priority.
Let's go with F-6.
I'd be okay with that.
Excuse me.
You have to live in the real world.
Ryu Soma is stupid!
...and then kept pleading with me to go out with him for hours.
And then?
Better than before.
Maki...
What did you...
A bug?
Th-This is...
3D brain circuit network in the sample heads confirmed.
There was such a program?
An emergency hatch is behind you!
I'm not stupid!

An unexpected guest.
We couldn't say no.
No order to intercept yet.
In the aerospace test...
About your aircraft...
Then I'll take you to our waiting area.
Anyway, keep your mouth shut.
But...
That's right.
Sorry, but our commander's a woman.
It's not fair, God!
Not quite like Alaska's, though.

I used to talk about these things with my buddy all the time.

Careful radar monitoring advised.
You can't.

Roger.
What?
Better make sure you're ready.
Mister...
Lock on to target.
My future's already been negated.
Over and over again!
Stop!
I can't escape from destiny.
Pull out.

You don't want it?

It's not a lie.
Won't you even smile for me?
Code 127.
Move us from defense level red to yellow.
Roger.
Our warning was ignored.
Even if there was a strike called, the condition we're in...
We've lost SARG 3.
So-so.
I've just had terminal bad luck for ages.
I hope there won't be an earthquake.
For sharing and understanding.
You're warm.
...look like you're gazing so far away.
So?
So you're that lone cowboy chasing down your enemies.
Take it easy, dear.
What's with the rough handling?
Either someone thought they could sell it for a fortune...
What?
I told you!
Come on, I'll ask again.
Answer me, Maki.
Beautiful.
What about the one who filed the report?
I see.
We're all humans.
Funeral HQ.
You remembered!
Do you read me, Lt. Soma?
Yeah.
We could make it.
We have to take this!
Maybe that wasn't a piece of an alien.
I guess so.

The target has changed course.
He may just be the only weapon we have left.
If we lose him in the course of the battle...
I envy you.
I, on the other hand, am merely old.
Someday, you'll be insecure and take comfort in roses.
Built with stronger alien motors
So that's it.
I could never have even killed you.
It's the same IFF codes as the SARGs.
No sign it is a progressive-type alien.
Very nice.
I have no idea.
But this...
...is like a lynching.
I don't understand anything anymore.
Target is moving.
Target approaching Pilgrimage Point.
The Earth's in a crisis.
The target's speeding up!

With the alien threat over for now,
Wait!
What's good?
No, it's too convenient to say things like that now, isn't it?
None of that is forgivable.
Sorry for the last-minute report.
You are also relieved from your post as commander.

No way!

It all started with that incident at Morgue.
Could that be jealousy?

Oh, I'm so late! Why is this happening?
Let's go, Rei-kun. Mama, I'm off!
Sana-chan!
Today, there is a live broadcast of a show called "Child's Toy,"
He's the one!
Ignore me, will you!?
Come on! Babbit! Babbit! Move your feet! Come on! Come on!
Oh, right.
What? What? How do you do it?

Ah, Rei-kun! What are you shooting!?
Sure, if he's a nice man, I'm taken with him.
...and cut him apart! Cut him apart! Poke that big dummy like this!
No one like that here.
Even though it's springtime?
Am I right? Yeah? Am I right?
You! You! It's all your fault!

 My mood graph goes up and down! 
 But I let it all out on a live "Child's Toy"! 
Yoo-hoo!
You're two minutes faster than yesterday. Nice job.
Thanks, Rei-kun. Today, we just barely made it here safe.
Sana-chan...
Are you worried about me, Rei-kun?
T-this w-works p-pretty g-good!
I-I'll c-come t-to h-help y-you r-right a-away.
Don't get too full of yourself, Kurata!

He makes me so irritated, my mood graph is all lied up in knots!

Hayama-san is going to wash his face. Don't bother him!

You're the first one who's ever been able to stand up to him!
Still, I wonder if they'll harass Sana-chan now.

It's not love or anything, I love... it's girls that I...
Help!

--Get her to the nurse's office, quick! --I'll go get my gym clothes.
What? Are you all right? You're trembling.

Go on and try hitting me, if you can!
But if you can't keep up, you can run away--

Okay, Rei-kun, onto the next one!
What are you talking about?
Jingle, jingle, snow is falling!
Butterflies and flowerbeds!
My stomach hurts.
Completely!
--Sana-chan, a job well done! --Nice work, Sana-chan!
You booked more commercial work?
Mm-hmm, four more of them.
Yes?

I was thinking it would take around ten years.
Yeah, me too.

You don't say. Okay then, see you later.
I see, so if that's why he kissed me, then it all zebra-tails.
--He's always seeing the eccentric part of me. --It's Sana-chan, from TV! She's so cute!
Yikes, what are you choking on, Father?
What is this!? He's kidding, right? I just barely saw Father Hayama!
He ate some sushi, and then collapsed.
He coughed up enough blood to fill a washbasin.
Father Hayama, no! It can't be...!
But he coughed up so much blood...
Yes, you're right-- oh, Sana-chan, you came, too?
I really was worried about you.
So was I.
Burutcha...?
Oh, it's rubber.
Huh? But aren't you seeing Hayama-kun now?
After all, you've already kissed. Right, Shimura?
And she's getting phone calls from him too, huh, Sensei?
Better, better. The hospital food is good,
Hayama, this is the first time
Father, get out of the hospital soon, okay?
I've been waiting for an answer.

Don't let Hayama hear this word.
Yeah, he was more concerned about his conduct grade.
Hayama. I wonder if I didn't think about the consequences and acted again.
Making a karate club, only because I'm stirring.
Kurata!
Nakao!
- Will you be quiet for a second. - Why?
It's in my bag.
Sensei, what about Nakao-kun?
What are you saying?
Kurata! Leave it!
And so he always carries all the weight and gets more enclosed.
But if you live, I have a feeling that I could win against the odds.
we have only lived for around 13 cubic meters.
You're comparing different measure.
Don't confuse me.
Nakao-kun, you're probably not understanding
Brother!
What does that mean?
Their disappearance, it's proof that they have something to do with the incident.
I thought it just hit me but I guess it pierced on to me.

That's ridiculous...
Because I wanna try crying with you

Ah, Matsui-san, what's wrong?
See you at gymnastics!
And then...
I'm dead but, no. Why did I die?
Since Nakao has that letter, Hayama-san is in trouble now.
- Huh?! - Got it?! You guys wait!
Why does he do this?! Why does he have to be so dirty?!
I was thinking of the Karate Club and going to the same high school as Hayama.
This time Nakao was safe so it was alright
but Hayama will definitely bring on bigger chaos.
What is the need to research?!
When you questioned if I was in your class I thought that I was not a living being.
What else do I have, Sensei?
Nakao-kun asking for help... It seems that you missed it, Sengoku-sensei.

So get yourself together, adult!
Oh yeah! For your black belt!
Ok.

He's the one!
Huh? What are they, Sana-chan?

By "that dummy," you mean that problem child Hayama-kun?
He's nothing as cutesy as a "problem child." He's the devil!

Oh, by the way, this fine man with the sunglasses is my manager,

Uh-huh.
One other thing, Akito... Dad's going to come home as early as possible.
I told your sister to make something every night.
It's your allowance.
For whiter teeth to die for, Hamigakin X!
Are you okay, Sana-chan?
What are you up to?
about whether or not you had to work this Saturday.
That's strange. I wonder why Rei-kun turned that down. My Saturday is free.
Sure!
That's right! Asako-san picked me out!
Hey there, it's been three days. You're over your cold. That's great.
Oh, right. Here, here...
Still, little by little...
I forgot that I had work! Farewell, my friends!
Do you know what it means to be a pimp?
It hurts! It hurts!
I'll pray for Rei-kun to have a complete recovery!!
Then what is it?
I'm sorry.
Is it this late already!?
Sensei, it's your editor, Onda. I've been staying overnight here
That's okay. I'm glad you're here.
Huh? Where is your manager?
Is that right? How grand of you to come by yourself.

All of his bad luck started as a result of that woman, I hear.
Do something about it!

This is no time for that!

You can't play dumb with me!
What's going on!? Take off those sunglasses!
it's time to get out of there!

No matter what others may say, right now,
Excuse me for showing my regular face.
"Baby"? Rei-kun, you know Asako-san?
--What's this? You're mistaken about a few things! --You dated her? "Baby"? "Baby"? "Asako"?
It's Sana-chan! Sana-chan's here, too!
Asako-chan, hurry!
I want to talk! Rei, make sure you call me! I'll be waiting!
I thought it was strange, you know?
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

There's no way he sees you as a woman. And the woman from his past?
Huh? Where's Sagami-kun?
Rei-kun, things have gone so smoothly between us up to now... Rei-kun...
She said "Sana-chan, you'll be a star in the future." Mama, are you listening?
Mama, we're home! I brought one of those homeless guys
you were talking about earlier with me!
Rei-kun!
I wouldn't want you to treat me to anything.
Akito-kun, wait! Excuse us. Wait up! Explain this to me from the top!

Well, shua. If you get too close to me,
all you can see are teeth, and you'd say...
if you laugh at someone's teeth!
I did come home safely on the train, too.
That's cold.
I don't have any work tomorrow.
I see. All right.
Rei! Call me! I want to talk! Rei, make sure you call me! I'll be waiting!
 "Back against the wall." That's what you say about times like these. 
 Put them together and you get 15 pains.

Rather, she seems to be enjoying herself.
She's mad! Hisae-chan is mad! I'm worried.
Better work quietly, huh?
Sana is depressed?
"Teenage Troubles." By Kurata Misako. Not bad...
Sana-chan! I, Sagami Rei, will protect you,
even if it means my own life!
 A - I - U - E, E - O - A - O, A - Ka - Sa - Ta - Na... 
 "Uncooked wheat, uncooked rice," Na - Ni - Nu - Ne - No. 
 Cheetah is with him, "Oo - kya - kyan - kya!" 
 Chan-chan, Bara-bara, "There's a cloud of dust!" 
 Cheep-cheep, chirp-chirp, "twitchy little pen." 
Okay, ready for take 2... Start!
All done? Really?
Whew, Babbit has been keeping up with Sana-chan the whole time,
"Anyone who talks to Sana-chan will be ostracized."
Looks like those girls are amusing themselves by shunning Kurata.
Taking a nap like that without getting yelled at.
Now that you mention it, at some point, she was going to--
Oki?
What were you guys doing!?
Well, would you not run amuck,
even I might have gotten depressed.
I'm sure that everyone "doesn't hate me," so that's why they got so upset.
Huh?
No one cares about me...
Such a tough daughter...
Huh? You're done?
and also played the tragic heroine, Juliet. "Oh, Romeo..."
But it sounds fun! When will they air?
Don't do anything stupid.
Tsuyoshi-kun isn't here today. What could be the matter?
but she doesn't appear to be here, either.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
Babbit.
who is causing trouble yet again!
It's your own fault for getting your face so close.
What do you mean by that!?
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you.
Is that right?
Sana-chan is up in the observation lounge,
--Idiot...!? --I hear that Hayama-san's first kiss came when he was in kindergarten.
...here?
Sensei!
"Sana-chan, radically blue"
Oh, you don't say! That is who I am, after all!
 Rei-kun, it didn't happen, it was nothing! 
--Yow! I bit my tongue! --I was just at City Hall.
I'm a freshly hard-boiled Sana-chan!
As long as I have this on, Hayama...
I can't get through the door, so I can't go to the bathroom!
Mm-hmm.
Okay, that's enough.
Class has begun. Unless you let me start, I'll knock you flat!
Whoa! What the hell!? This is kidnapping!
Sensei, whenever you're ready, okay!
--Shimura-san! There's still some cake, right? --Hmm? Shimura-san?
See to it that you take good care of my daughter from now on.
Okay, there!
I have no intention of forgiving you! However...
I know.
--I'll bet there's some meaning --That means there's that much more reason
 Distraught Sana-chan; what to do, Sana-chan? 
I really am distraught.
Kissed!?
Uh-huh, that's right.
That's something I still can't tell even you about, Rei-kun.
Aren't you... Kurumi-san?
--Sagami-kun... --Yes?
Yes, yes, after you dumped me, I flunked out of college.
but that started to get demeaning,
Not until she's an adult.
Asako-san...!
I think it's about time...
That's what you say about times like these.
I've been waiting for an answer.
...panic!!
Adis, seor.
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
Go to last week's VTR, and start!
Calm... down... you're disgracing yourself.
Mama, why--
S- Sana-chan...
What is this!? What's going on!? What's going on, I said!
Thank you.
Ah, what on earth are those two thinking!?
Yes?
Can't I see her?
For the moment, Sana forgets about her love troubles and calms down.
Aono-chan, what do you have in your handbag?
An egg?
"To Aono-chan, Kurata Sana"
it's going to be your fault, you...
Dimwitted dimwit-man!?
There was something that Mama said to me this one time!
So for now, you don't have to know about it.
Why, you...! You three-story reinforced-concrete hardhead!
It's been born!
Calligraphy Special!!
Asako-san at my house...!
Done writing?
S- Sana-chan?
Rei-kun, you said you wouldn't have anything to do with Asako-san, right?
Is it true...?
You were just pretending, after all!?
What's so wrong about telling her the truth?
No... No...!
I'm so... I'm so... terribly embarrassed!
That's too much. Charge me less.
W- what's the matter?
Yes, she will.
than to never have seen it at all!
Nope.
she'll get from ever having seen it.
You really do say the exact opposite of everything I do, huh?
You're right.
--Sickening! --Comical!!
I don't think you need to be so concerned about your disgrace.
Right?
Thanks, Hayama. If I hadn't run into you,
I might have run off to some far away city and ruined my life.
Shut up! I heard you!
Say--
What does that mean!? Do you kiss everyone you don't hate!?
Fine!
Although, all good people have their bad points,
Mm-hmm.
I haven't moved on.
an8Good-bye love, I hope you at least believe that my love was real.
I'm all right, so why...
an8Good-bye love, I hope you at least believe that my love was real.
I've been waiting for an answer.
My heart may he settled, but my mind is in a...
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
he's there,
But no sooner does it happen than he collapses!
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha,
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
"Father, You Are His Father"
Not far hence is summer. Hark! We must devote ourselves...
...Says Rei-kun, who also slept in, right?
I became awfully busy. --Zenjiro-san is scheduled to come, too.
Sana-chan, let's play.
You'll have to forgive me. My brilliant manager
Sana-chan, you've been a rather unsociable little duck lately.
You don't need to overturn anything.
Kill me! Kill me, please!
Nice and energetic, Sana-chan! Good, good!
What is the young lady thinking?
an8"Zenjiro's manager, Higashiyamato Sanekichi-san"
Okay, Rei-kun, onto the next one!
If you love ice cream, I love you!
Right, cut! Okay!
In the winter, ice cream's the best!
"Uchiyamada-kun retires"
I haven't even had time to think about where the love I've lost has gone.
Okay then, let's awl blow on outta here and get some yakiniku!
You booked more commercial work?
If I act flabby, then I'm going to be flabby.
W- where are we going?
Never mind, just drive where I tell you. Now...
too affectionately.
Yes?
So you see, it's okay. Go ahead and get back together.
Whoops, it's this way.
Oh, on closer look, Father Hayama, you've gotten so scrawny!
But I never knew that Akito likes sushi.
Mm-hmm, delicious!
Huh?
My pop might be dying.
Here you are.
Hayama, be strong.
both Hayama and I...
He's all right. Yeah, thank goodness!
Mm-hmm.
I'm giving you this.
I'm going to let you in on something good.
Then manipulate him, right in the palm of your hand.
H- hold on, that's not something a good mother would say!
In dire straits,
to always go along with the scenario.
This Time, Sana is the Lonely Wolf This Time, Sana is the Lonely Wolf
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
Hayama, this is the first time I've ever seen you
Yes! Yes! Yes! Zenjiro-sensei! Me! Me! Pick me! Yes, yes, yes!
Can any of you kids give me the right answ-uh?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You're pretty confident, huh?
"Dappi" is when an insect or snake sheds its old skin. Like this...!
Yeah, more or less. It's a good thing you're already wearing your costume.
That's it. Sana-chan is working hard,
What about dinner? Hey...
A-yep!
--Mine's coming up real soon. --What do you want for a present?
It's a secret.
Okay, smile!
Right!
Morning? Which morning? What day is it? Who am I?
Oh, no... Oh, no!
I'm sorry!
I really am sorry.
Sana-chan looks kind of somber.
You know, I feel a little sorry for Sana-chan over there.
What's she doing? She's not one bit sorry.
What could be troubling Japan's most cheerful girl,
Could it be because I've got her doing too much work?
So, is something wrong with Sana?
 "Skewer some potluck stew," Sa - Shi - Shu - Se - So. 
Right.
Cut! The wind is too strong. Sana-chan, sorry about that.
Elegant and revitalizing, even in the jungle!
This time, we really are finished.
All right! Starting tomorrow, I'm going to play with everyone,
and is truly worn out.
Who are you?
Hisae-chan and them are sending it around.
Don't be doing anything so stupid!
I saw, I saw.
Girls sure like to shun people, huh?
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too. That's not fair, huh?
What?
because they were having some fun with it.
Listen, you... What good is it going to do for you to get mad?
That so? Okay, okay...
and played Tarzan in the jungle,
and also played the tragic heroine, Juliet. "Oh, Romeo..."
You mean, you did that much work?
I was just joking, Hayama-san.
Ah, now that you mention it, I haven't seen him.
That's what you say about times like these.
to always go along with the scenario.
...panic!!
We went to Tsuyoshi-kun's house and--
Episode 13 of the Don't Cry, Strong One, You're the Oldest Son Saga,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-hatter,
Tsuyoshi-kun isn't here today. What could be the matter?
Sensei called Tsuyoshi's house a little while ago, and his dad answered.
You may be divorced, but you're still his dad, right!?
--Money is not the issue here! --Don't act so smug over a measly 50 million!
Hey there, you're at odds.
Hey, you, hold it!
"5 Yen"
He might not have said anything to me, but what if he called over to your place?
Tsu--
we should have a grown man there, too.
From now on, Big Brother will act as Father, too.
But Big Brother, you've got hair!
annoying dads, dads that can fly...
Ah! Akito is reading Big Brother's manga!
Sana-chan, be careful with those!
--It was no trouble at all. --If you want to thank me, give me money--
T- Tsuyoshi-kun...
Don't tell Aono or my mom, okay? Don't tell them I was crying.
Sana-chan...
Thanks, Akito-kun.
Well, even during just our 12-year lifetimes,
Mm-hmm. It turns out he had to move suddenly.
--How is your manuscript coming along? --But Tsuyoshi-kun is right nearby.
Sana-chan, you're good friends with Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
What do you think about Tsuyoshi-kun?
 And while we're at it, bums can be waved around, too! 
--Sana-chan is strange, even at home. -- Go, go, go, go, go! 
And so, starting today, my name will be Sasaki,
Way to go, Tsuyoshi!
Okay, then, take your seat, and let's start class.
That's one for the books-- Sugita raising her voice like that...
Y- you don't mean...
I love Tsuyoshi-kun!!
Listen, Tsuyoshi-kun, I didn't even know you last Valentine's Day!
I was in a different class in 5th grade! I didn't give you anything!
--so I gave it to another boy who was standing nearby... --Take it! Take it! Take it!
You're heartless.
Birthday? Oh...
U- uh... Sugita-san...
Father, how are you eating, and stuff?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there,
"The Summer of My Promise -Part I"
I always feel Relax,
You want to know about my dad?
Whew, whenever I put on a serious face, my shoulders get stiff.
You haven't forgotten that we're having outdoor school, right!?
That's why I'm taking a little from each of them, so that it adds up to 500 total.
You didn't have to buy 500,000's worth, though.
it will be summer vacation, and there's this tasty TV drama that--
Absolutely no way!
That's a shame.
Mama is calling me!
Bye!
I see...
Why are you wearing the bathroom slippers!?
--Outdoor! Outdoor! Ya-hoo-hoo! --Don't go running around the house
--For love and courage, it's outdoor school! Here we go, out-door-door! --wearing those things! Stop!
We're going! We're going, right?
Appetite-- okay!
Now see here, line up there! Get on the bus at once! At once!
Wrinkled hag!
They'll turn out fine-fine.
--Narunaru!
Thank you, thank you!
The first day will be in the Aishu highlands.
What kind of snacks did you bring?
Our mother-daughter relationship will be...
So, did you want something?
 But still, this country road is fun! 
This guy's got some impressive tackle!
Nobody is listening, right?
You can have the fatty part.
Ooh, the meat is all gone!
--Amazing! Kurata is eating the meat raw. --Sana-chan is wild!
--She's not even putting any sauce on it. --She's a wild child.
Spacing off all the time, and stuff.
What, you ask...?
an8"Midnight Teachers' Banquet!"
The secret's out!
All right, let's go back and wake everyone up, Hayama.
"Beep" doesn't tell me anything.
They'll turn out fine-fine.
an8"The second day is mountain climbing!!"
an8"Not enough sleep"
 The faraway stars that you can see, too... 
-- The mizu is our water.  --I feel so distant... so agitated...
Are they shooting a TV show?
No way! I never heard about this!
Now, hold on, you!
I am adamant! As an educator, I say...
Hey.
Hayama? Did you fall down, too? What a fluke.
an8"Badger" "Catfish"
I give up!
--Hey!! --Hey!!
Come to think of it, it's dangerous to get too close to him!
You've already got two previous convictions!
What kind of remark is that!? I can't let that one go by!
Last night, before we went and joined the teachers.
Oh yeah. What was it?
It occurs to me that you...
What are you talking about? That's silly!
Mm-hmm.
Essay?
And our usual classroom...
The Summer of My Promise- Part II
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-hatter,
My favorite expression is "Boo an being slapdash. "
Yay! My name is Babbit! I'm the white bat who always butting in.
Mama... Mama... might just hate me!
but there aren't any mothers who hate their own children, are there?
--Which means that Sana-chan --S- Shimura-san, do you have
Flashlight!
Snap to, would you?
So, our family is turning into this happy circle...
Why not?
Won't ever happen.
Her husband will have to marry into her family.
What are you laughing at?
thanks to you.
Embarrassed! Embarrassed! Embarrassed! Hayama is embarrassed!
How am I supposed to smile when there's nothing funny?
-- Break out your horns!  --Break out your horns!
Yeah.
Come on, Hayama, sing along. Run-ta-ta, run-ta-ta!
I thought you might have been in an accident!
"If you feel like crying, come find me."
Say, Sana-chan...
Sound suspicious to me!
Right, Hayama!? We're getting along, right!?
Okay!
But even so, I'm insanely busy!
--Sana-chan! Let go! --Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom!
Don't die, Tom!
--Bocari is a hit! Bocari Sweet! --Huh? It's Sana-chan again.
Are you okay there, pops?
Ha ha!
Sana-chan! Are you ready?
Poor things...
Mm-hmm! Zenjiro-san, you tell it like it is!
If you think that all I am is cute, you're going to get hurt.
Naozumi-kun brings you a bouquet of flowers and a box of Heal-Band. Got it?
--I am a genius at this, after all! --He's the boy who was in that one recent drama,
Oh, both of them are so adorable!
Okay, job well done!
They said you can keep this. Here.
I know your secret.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
he's there.
And our usual classroom...
it's time to get out of there!
I don't quite understand him.
H- hold up!
Sana-chan!
Okay, Naozumi-kun...
while we were shooting that ice cream commercial,
I- is that right?
Whoa! Did you just get caught up in your momentum and profess your love!?
Where were you carrying that stuff?
I also come see the plays that Gekidan Komawari puts on each year.
Naozumi! Where are you!? We're going to be late
 That makes everything feel better! 
Editorial staff member Onda-san...!
Onda Takezo-san!
You want to start talking...
Rei-kun, what are you thinking about?
This guy is so easy to figure out.
Eek! I think I'm going to rupture my groin!
Your tushie is split to begin with, you know. I think...
"What a pain..."
Hey, this is ringing, here!
 One, two, three, yay! Come on, one, two, three, yay! 
Uh, hello? I'm Zenjiro here! I'm Zenjiro, the guy who is on TV a lawt! Excuse me!
Ah, it's that boy! Hey, you know who that is?
Hayama?
Isn't that right?
Just between us, she's even kissed him, huh?
You're kidding me...
Sana-chan, you seem to be enjoying yourself even now.
Still, I think you should relax a little bit.
Oh, you mean swallowing a person! I know it, I know it!
an8"Enter" "Person"
I could be. I'm really not sure about that.
Yeah, more or less. Lately, the signing fee for her
--Akito-kun, good grief! --Akito-kun, good grief!
--You mean Sunglasses? --Tsuyoshi-kun!
My fields have been burned!
 Heart-pounding invigoration! Sana-chan's nervousness! 
 The pounding is important, the pounding of my heart. 
Pipe down, Mister!
Come on, everyone, stop wearing such gloomy faces.
 All alone, all alone, she's getting along, hoy! 
Tom!
Poor Tom...
What about you?
There's no way we can get near them.
Why nawt? It's going to take a lawt to fix my broken hawt, aft-uh today.
--Hayama-kun, would you pick that up for me? --You want to break up?
Is that so, is that so?
Huh? Akito-kun, why? Why would you?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there.
he's there,
The press is raising a great uproar over it, while others are left speechless.
Mama, the Aoki Prize-winning writer.
They said that Sana-chan will be coming out this way!
--Sana-chan really is coming from here! --Huh, Akito-kun? Did you hear me?
Please don't pull me!
--Hang in there! --I'm hanging in there!
Oh, sorry!
Amazing, Sana-chan. You sure are popular. I'm taken aback.
Sana-chan! One picture, please!
--Yo! --Akito-kun!
What a shame!
What are you bringing up Naozumi-kun here for!?
Idiot?
Did you call me an idiot!?
Is that still bugging you? You're going to turn into a bug!
They always send me the book after the day it goes on sale.
Just then...
That's why I do this.
So, he's the one she divorced when she was twenty?
Lend me some money. I'll pay you back double-- no, triple.
Where would you like to go?
but I don't have a single penny to give to you!
Wow, it's running, it's running!
--The pimp... --Me.
Salt!
-- You can't hate him, but you can't help him!  -- No matter how many times 
so if you're going to form any opinions, do so after you read it.
I would certainly like to ask that of the Sensei herself.
they can apparently joke about things like this,
but for me and my daughter, it was the truth, so it was no joke.
to be misfortunate in and of itself.
I'd like for them to read 'The Pimp and I.'"
Akito-kun! Have you read this?
I went to go see how she was, every day.
It was something that I had secretly made up my mind
Yes, Mama.
I wonder how she must have felt when she said that.
Please go away!
How is Sana-chan doing right now?
Bye!
J- just a minute, Hayama-kun!
Huh? That's Sana-chan on the back!
"Back against the wall."
That's what you say about times like these.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Is there anything I can eat? Let's check the fridge...
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
...not wearing brassieres yet?
by relieving some of the tension?
Say, can I turn on the TV?
--Well, let's move on to Tokyo's own Obana Miho, --Thank you.
--My trivial secret is-- --They were, huh? I'm glad I stayed home.
"When Gekidan Komawari had their first theatrical production,
--and took it to be praise toward me." --That's because you're such an amazing person, Mama!
I love you, Mama! I love you!
Is that so? That might allow my daughter to feel better.
It's as though she doesn't care that she was abandoned,
Oh, no! What do I do!?
No doubt!
an8"Hayama, are you really...?"
Isn't she?
Hayama, you really do have a mole right here, huh?
It's a little unusual, isn't it?
Stop that. It stands out too much.
Let's go.
--A giraffe? That's a giraffe! --Just a minute!
Hey, I guess we didn't know what we were seeing!
I couldn't help myself from rushing in here!
Okay, ka-ching!
--Faw, faw away, to my planet. --Be back soon!
--Ah, it's Zenjiro-san!
In life a lot can happen, to you.
an8"Still can't sleep"
Can I go over there?
What?
That was the reason for this book. To find my real mother.
"I only had a five percent chance of having a child.
Hayama...
The press conference was held after the taping of his drama,
The agency he is affiliated with has refused all interviews.
I ask you to please leave Sana-chan alone.
Now, my dream is to take a more active role in the world,
I'm trying to pass you off as a bishonen, and that just looks weird!
Rei-kun!
Akito-kun!
I've been waiting for an answer.
My heart may he settled, but my mind is in a...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-hatter,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
It's Tsuyoshi!
Divorced!?
After that, I don't care.
--Money is not the issue here! --Don't act so smug over a measly 50 million!
What did you call me!?
Who needs an old man who doesn't know where his own kid lives, you dimwitted old coot!?
his dad looked kind of lonely.
You dirty letch...!
I'm glad your father is feeling better.
We're almost done with all of the finding a new apartment
and moving in and everything.
we should have a grown man there, too.
Oh, really? How was he doing?
He's fine.
Your chick is on the veranda!
Big Brother, what about Father? When is Father coming?
Ah! Akito is reading Big Brother's manga!
What?
--Wait! Those aren't-- --There's no water!
Okay, you're coming to school for sure tomorrow, right?
Damn straight.
He won't tell! He won't tell! Hayama says he won't tell, either!
Tsuyoshi-kun, I'll need my husband to take my name,
Mm-hmm.
--Is that right? --You're good at running away.
Bye now, Sana-chan!
See you at school tomorrow!
Way to go, Tsuyoshi!
and always says "Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you very much,"
Oh! Sugita declared her love!
But you did!
I had a hunch that's what it was...!
Whoa, Tsuyoshi's snapped again!
I've done a bad thing. To think that that was Tsuyoshi-kun...
It sure caught me out of balloons.
Can't you do something about that? Okay? Okay? It's a birthday day today!
Say no more! This one's for you, Sana-chan!
Sorry there aren't any presents.
Mm-mm, that's okay.
Ah! Sana-chan is going to be on TV!
happy birthday, Tsuyoshi-kun!
Tsuyoshi... Heading home?
Take care of Aono... and your mother.
You want to know about my dad?
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 14;
Pleased to meet you.
Sagami Rei-kun. He's my chauffeur and manager,
Lately, when he is by my side, I feel somewhat relaxed.
The girl that I gave birth to
I asked him if he wouldn't mind staying behind myself,
--when Hayama-kun is around, --You perve!
Yeah, thankfully!
She says her name is Sakai Keiko-san. She knew about your three stars.
What's the big idea, treating us like fools?
That doesn't even make sense!
I feel lucky to have been abandoned. I really love the life I'm living now.
--You idiot! Watch it with that thing! --You sure are acting like a big shot!
How come you didn't decide not to give birth?
Oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's all in the past.
Huh? You're going to sing?
 That's where Mama got my name from. 
What if I was actually born on March 6th?
I'd be Kurata Sa-Mu, right?
--Stop! --I'm not so sure about this.
Really!? Thank goodness! I am Sana!
I see.
Mm-hmm, sure! Tsuyoshi-kun too.
It just doesn't seem like enough, somehow.
Thank you.
how about today you have some fun together with Sana-chan?
--Wow! Sana-chan! Sana-chan! --Looks like it worked out okay.
Whew, this is fun, huh, Akito-kun?
Terrific, Mariko-chan!
--It's the pumpkin coach! --No.
--Mawiko-chan knows about Cindewewwa. I wead about her in a book. --How cute! This little girl is my sister!
That...
You and I...
...that really scares me whenever I think about it.
it really frightens me. After all, if you hadn't... I wouldn't...
Zoom!
Oh, really? Not that...
and take you away from me.
 Sora, sora, sora, dance of the Maro-chans! 
It's a Maro-chan line dance that I've been saving.
This isn't Maro-chan's house, or anything of the sort.
Oh, shank goodnesh I am wearing dem...
There has been an outbreak of in-house traffic accidents!
Hey, you two! A good morning, isn't it!?
Oh, why not? You stayed with me the whole time, didn't you?
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
that Kodocha is so populuh, Hayama Akito-kun!
I'm Obana.
I'm Kurata Sana, age 11, TV personality and 6th grader!
It's time to do arithmetic! It has already started!
Stop! Stop that! Stop!
Cut it out already, would you?
Dracula!
Here it is!
You're amazing.
Not really.
Ah, damn! She's adopting a strange pose!
You think that your way of thinking is the only right way, don't you?
Well, don't force it on me, it's annoying!
You couldn't understand the way I feel!
I hate this! I hate this! I hate this!
Mongoose.
This is bad, this is bad!
I still have relish! Not rubbish, relish!
When you get the answer wrong, a giant hammer comes down on you.
--Wait till you see what happens in the second half! --What an oversight!
I forgot that I had work! Farewell, my friends!
Rei, it's you, isn't it!?
You can't play dumb with me!
I can trust you, right, Rei-kun?
Coming someplace like this,
Sana-chan, aren't you rushing it?
Okay then, what's your answuh?
Lemon juice.
The question is, what did Hayama do after this?
--Give the boy a piece. --C- cake? Eh?
You have a visitor. We're coming in.
Sana-chan...
Eh? What did I say?
Why is this?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
...for two.
I've crossed plains, mountains, and valleys!
and I'm finally back to my normal life.
Aw, you're too much!
Oh, sorry, I can't help but make a big deal out of this.
"Thanks for doing that for my sake," would sound weird somehow.
can't very well show up empty-handed!
Hey, is Sana-chan really coming with him?
Everyone, Sana-chan is coming! Hurry, hurry!
Ah, they're here, they're here!
Or rather, I don't remember it at all, but when I was little,
I understand that you took care of me for a month.
Sannas...?
Everyone line up nice, so there's no fighting.
What kind of defiant little kid is this!?
--Sana-chan's reception party ready!
Not you, too!
--Waah! I want a papa and mama, too! --Sensei, Nao-chan is crying again!
--Sana-chan, your jokes are hawsh! --That girl was here together with you, Nao-chan.
--How lawng are you going to kid around, Sana-chan? --That's Sana-chan and Nao-chan.
--Then, your girlfriend must be in Nagoya! --She doesn't have a papa or mama, either.
I won't cry anymore. I won't cry.
--Welcome home...
Everyone knows that you came from here, Sana-chan,
The rhythm is a nori-nori Kodocha pattern.
 Oh! I've come, come, come here, come to the sea. 
Oh, my god! What is this! What is this!? Why!? What an incredible reception!
Don't go strutting around, just because you're on TV.
If you don't know, then look it up for yourself, Auntie.
Easy, easy, easy... at this rate, I'm going to lose any chance of recovery.
It's even delicious raw! Cake! Cake! Cake!
Thank you, thank you.
What was that, Sana-chan?
Okay, come quick! Hurry, come quick! Come right away!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Sorry, I don't have time to entertain you right now.
--Say, are you driving!? --I'm driving!
For the first time in my life, I'm driving all-out!
Three seconds, did you say!?
Three!
Okay, Ko-chan! I challenge you to a bungee jump contest!
"I heard the neighbors put up a fence around their house."
Sure enough, I am an idiot!
Don't you look cool now, exposed little boy?
That thing which is unspeakable by young maidens has come out!
Look here, look here!
Nope, don't have it.
You just saw it, right? My butt is already split.
he's the one who looks like that!
What's this now? You really do have something to say, don't you?
Hey! Are you playing with fire again!?
Oh, so that's it!
Look.
"Sana-chan, wel--?"
It's been quite a hullabaloo,
 --It's making me, making me, making me cry.  --Sure it wasn't "Sana-chan is irritating"?
to always go along with the scenario.
from anyone's viewpoint.
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
My former boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun. He's my chauffeur and manager.
What, Sensei?
You're not going to watch any more?
I have... a favor to ask.
"Matsunami Dojo"
Hayama, huh?
What's the matter, Hayama? Aren't you going home?
The most important thing, to those who aspire to the martial arts--
Are you trying to lecture me?
...if you're going to pursue this, now's the best time.
 --the odds and ends!  --I'm no good... I'm no good...
I wonder if Hayama-kun is thinking about taking karate,
I'm going to go watch his karate lesson tomorrow with Tsuyoshi-kun.
--Aya-chan, seems like you and Tsuyoshi are getting along pretty well lately. --Rei-kun, you okay?
--Not like that! Not like that! It's not like that! --I'm no good...
Sana-chan, remember, there's a taping of "Child's Toy" today.
Yes?
don't tell me you're thinking of quitting.
 I apologize more than Niagara falls. 
 Sorry, noodles, forgive me, tea table. 
Sana-chan! Sana-chan!
Sensei...
there's no reason to force her to continue working.
...is what will happen to you from here on out.
I heard that Japanese girls are good at karate,
but the boys can't hold their own against the rest of the world.
The rest of the world...!?
Here comes another simpleton.
 Sana-chan will tough it out, tough it out, with you! 
 Cheering for you, toughing it out, sticking it out, too! 
The person's weight dummy rushed here to cheer you on, too!
I can't believe that our Hayama-kun is cleaning.
Hey, you guys!
Hey! You guys, go home already!
I told you, there's a taping of "Child's Toy" today!
an8"Telegraph game"
She's feeling reluctant.
I'm not having a hard time goo-goo. I'm not sad about anything either, goo-goo.
Mm-hmm...
or hide my nervousness about being among all adults,
Oh, you couldn't ask us to do that...
Hey!
Where are you going, Sana-chan!?
Clouds! Sky!
Yo, Hayama! Are you pretending to be in training, or something?
What do you think?
You think so, really?
Say, why did you suddenly start taking karate?
That's when I... I wanted to start doing something, too.
Later.
--Sana-chan...
this early in the evening!? Oh, it's you!
to always go along with the scenario.
...for two.
Next time, on "Kodomo no Omocha," episode 23, the Adventures of Zenjiro-san and Mariko-chan Saga,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
Sagami Rei-kun. He's my chauffeur, manager, and former boyfriend.
I'm hitting something, right!?
You hit Babbit, too.
When did he get back there?
I've been waiting for you to let your guard down, Sana-chan.
--Yahoo! I nailed it! I won! --You've stopped making sense.
--Don't use the show for your own poiposes! --Sana-chan,
S- Sensei! I'm sure Sana-chan didn't mean any harm when she said it!
Can we go tomorrow!?
Keiko-san...
Yes?
What about Sana-chan?
Sorry, but where did you put that one dark green blouse with the stain?
Sana-chan... Sana-chan...
I don't really want to see him.
Where's my lunch? He said there'd be fried mackerel sandwiches.
Don't cry! Don't cry! Big Brothuh was wrong! Eat! Eat it awl up!
I told her not to move.
"Unworried by her parents' concern..."
Do you have any ideas where she would go?
Any idea where...?
Back up, back up.
She's not here!
but in real life, this would be pretty hawsh!
Telephone? Who from?
I'm sorry, I never intended to call you again,
This is why dramas are so tense!
We have to look for her!
Now, calm down!
I- it's no technique.
Ah, it's your Burutcha. Is Sana-chan trying to contact you? A code?
It's long.
"Zenjiro-san"
You're good.
And now, the day has come
A little more than halfway full is good.
Babbit likes it strong!
Pour in the tea!
Pour plenty in there!
Shall we have seconds?
No, it's me!
Hey, sir, come on!
It's a wine mountain and toothpick design! Now leave me alone!
Mister!
an8"Zenjiro-sama, this is your rental car"
Hey, let go of me! I'm going home now!
What's that!?
Do you know where Mariko-chan is?
Mariko!
What's this, some kind of trouble?
Thank goodness you're safe!
W- what the hell is happening here?
and didn't help out at all.
"Mariko-crunch trouble, whereabouts insomnia.
Lights on!
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
it's time to get out of there!
we can't have any fighting. Wait here, and let's see what happens.
Sign this?
Listen, Hayama, young man!
That's right, it's no use trying to talk to him.
Let's come-come over the rainbow!
 Those cute uniforms are a little embarrassing. 
Everyone should be tested to check their aptitude,
A te---st!
The test is in three days. Those who do not get passing grades
Wow, the principal gave his approval for this?
I'm sure those children resent me, and despise me.
Aah, this is lame. After-school class?
Tanaka-sensei! But...
Okay then, let's start with math.
Sana-chan has gone rigid.
and it would take a long time to tell you about it.
No!! No! No! I want to be in middle school!
--It's not exactly your fault, Rei-kun. --Sensei! Your manuscript!
Oh! I know!
Good for you, Sana-chan!
But, before that, you need a little boost!
Did you study at home, too?
Friendship! Isn't that a nice word, Akito-kun?
Doing what?
Won't do any good.
It's hopeless.
Whoo! For the first time in ages, it's Hard-Boiled Hayama-san!
Sana-chan, don't you pay attention to what Hayama said!
Unless you want it to get out,
Where could Akito-kun have gone?
--people say, happiness dwells. --I don't want to believe that Akito-kun is making threats against the teachers,
--and returned with a tear-stained face." --What do I say to Sana-chan?
Look, if you do it this way, it gets picked up, see?
--Hold it! Hold it! --W- what's going on?
This smells like a conspiracy!
Well, it's just...
That's our Sana-chan, and her loud voice training she got from Gekidan Komawari.
Hold it!
They've been running around for over ten minutes now.
Shut up! I never told any lies!
I don't even have it!
What is this, Tanaka-sensei?
Andoh-sensei!
--Sensei!
I... I...
Make-out?
I know I heard that! "Make-out pictures"!
It's starting to come back to me... the excitement of that summer...
The students are cheering me on! This is without question...
That's what you say about times like these.
In dire straits,
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
he's there,
A Band-Aid For the Heart?
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
Yo, Kurosuke! I don't see him.
Sip!
Really? Okay...
Right, right.
Why not!?
"6th Grade 3rd Class"
an8"Gym time!"
Hayama-kun! I wonder if he's skipping class.
No...
Stay back...
Hayama!
Let go.
Aloha. I'm Hawaii-Babbit.
Can you understand that?
Scars of the heart do not disappear over a mere apology.
It's possible that she will continue to resent Hayama-kun
for the rest of her life.
So that's it. I thought that it was all in the past. However,
I guess to Mami-chan, it isn't.
Gaah! An avalanche!? Onda! Onda!
an8"Stop doing that"
Sorry about that. Come on in.
Babbit is okay here, too.
"Water spilled does not return to the basin,"
resenting and being resented by each other!
"Sana-chan thinks!"
 Hayama and Mami-chan, returning water to the basin, 
 becoming friends again, happy-py! 
Sana-chan's Mission, Mark I... I guess you'd call it.
We put this on him...
No good, huh?
This is kind of fun, huh?
That really is cute! What fun!
No fair running away, Akito-kun.
Hey!
But if you fawl, look, there's this cushion!
Oh? Sana-chan's the only one left?
Sana-chan, good luck!
"Sane-yan" appears to be a name that only Zenjiro calls him by.
That's a shame, Sana-chan. You can't go back to the basin anymore.
Sana-chan, you might be able to do something about it.
Oh, he's off, is he?
With a trophy for returning spilled water to the basin!
an8"Let's draw pictures in the park"
I'm drawing Kurosuke!
Hey, what do you think you're doing, cutting class!?
Hey!
Babbit will refrain from making any comments this time.
--Mami-chan, the folks at home must be worried about you. --Kurosuke...
Kurosuke!
Melon.
No.
...and the rabbit...
Yeah.
I've been waiting for an answer.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
Is there anything I can do? Ask me anything, Tsuyoshi-kun.
during cleaning time.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Aya-chan around today. Did she stay home?
That's why I'm telling you to stop.
No, that's okay. After all...
Really? Well, I'll just pop on over.
Right, sorry...
Ah, Sana-chan!
Shut up!
Stop!
Huh?
We can't keep Piyoko here. There are lots of other people
I'm going home to our old house! I'm going home with Piyoko!
What the hell are you doing?
and it won't be any problem if Piyoko crows a little at my house.
Really?
Mm-hmm, if it's your house, Sana-chan, that's fine.
Rei-kun! Rei-kun, that's a yellow card!
Understood.
Sensei...!
and cause problems for everyone else?
Huh? What brought that up all of a sudden?
Am I a girl who doesn't learn from experience?
Mayumi...
Good morning!
Hey, what part of my baby are you calling funny-looking? How rude of you!
I'm the same way.
I can't take it anymore!!
Anything but that!
What? What? What's the matter?
Hey, Aono!
It's okay, it's okay.
It really is strange, isn't it?
And so, the affair was more or less settled.
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
...for two.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 27, the Whirlpool of Intrigue in the Harbor District saga:
Give Me Sympathy and Lend Me Money
Elsewhere, what will be Zenjiro-chan's fate,
as he is caught up in it all?
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
Mama, the novelist, and Maro-chan, the chipmunk.
I'm Babbit. My favorite food is green tea rice.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy and good friend.
--"I don't have any money to lend you!" --"I don't have any money to lend you!"
who could do something like--
Did I get him?
Uncle, you never learn, do you?
Sana-chan, that's Gapyon, the lucky bunny,
Ex-husband? Ah, I read about it in that book.
Okay, cut!
Zenjiro-sensei! Hang in there!
--There's shua to be a better job coming alawng... --Sana-chan, you have a visitor!
With me?
Secret international organization?
"Oh! This is a serious development!!"
I traveled throughout all of Japan's mountains
If I don't have the money by the day after tomorrow,
here to keep an eye on your uncle.
Don't tell me you want to make money with my body... to use my body to...
If you will just come along with me for one day...
You want to use me, and keep it a secret from Mama and Rei-kun?
Isn't there easiuh,
I'm not too picky about my woik.
I should have known, Zenjiro-san!
I got some tasty woik!
--I'm not sure about this. --I knew it! It's tasty woik aftuh all. It's gotta be tasty woik.
--I turned him down flat. --What could be bettuh than that?
After all, I just couldn't leave him there.
He's the lucky bunny who brings happiness, Gapyon, I tell you!
Think about it.
shameless grade-schooler, aren't you!?
--I get excited just when our eyes meet, --I didn't want him to do those things! --It's not all that surprising, is it?
Ah, shut up! This isn't getting us anywhere, you know!
That's "walk in the park."
Whether you're serious,
--Go! --Go!
Congratulations, I say, congratulations!
--Okay then, you two, congratulations! --Okay then, you two, congratulations!
Of course, my true objective...
I can't keep up with this.
We've done 27 events in a row.
There are 30 more events before this evening for you.
A... talk... with... me...?
By special request, we have prepared some magnificent entertainment for you!
-- but you can't  -- but you can't  --We're going to save them from that?
-- Isn't that obvious!?  -- Isn't that obvious!? 
Hayama Chop!!
Hey! That hurts, you bastards!
This is your fault for being so ambiguous, sir.
so I thought that if Sana-chan would come be our host,
Ryosuke-kun is not such a bad person. I guarantee it.
President, you don't look like such a bad person yourself.
Oh? He has a dimple!
Well, that should clear up any doubts you had.
I am the president, Bosuda Bosuo. "Boss-da Boss-o"
an8"At that moment, Zenjiro-sensei was..."
an8"Ah I'm sleepy..."
The doll that Uncle gave me...
Once it has some money saved up in it, please return it to me. --Ryosuke"
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I understand!
Your tenacity is commendable!
In dire straits,
he's there.
And our usual classroom...
...up to now, just for today,
And our usual classroom...
What is this, Father Hayama!?
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
Father Hayama. Father, the background is too dark.
Sana-chan, come visit us again soon.
Delicious roasted sweet potatoes!
Your birthday. I've been meaning to ask for a while now.
H- how depressing.
It's no wonder you're so warped and everything.
Middle birthdays?
Don't go deciding that for all of us.
but are you sure we're not in the way?
Oh? That's the kind of person she was, huh?
I don't know.
I still don't know her.
Doesn't matter which one. Let's get going.
Say, didn't those flowers come from Beautiful earlier?
He can't tell anything from that.
...and as a result,
Father Hayama's in love-love!
Sensei is currently writing a romance novel,
Imagine, Father Hayama having a girlfriend!
As I recall, it has been over ten years since Hayama-kun's mother passed away.
Yeah, yeah, like he had an alligator stuck in his back teeth,
It sure was.
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! Those two are lovers!
Not at all. Natsumi-chan and Akito-kun sure have grown up, huh?
The reason for my heartfelt request has to do with Akito.
There they are!
What do we do?
What did I do?
It's not like that, Sana-chan! She's having trouble with her contacts--
Bingo!!
Watch, we're going to reenact the love-love scene!
Look, look, they were lovers, just like this!
--but suddenly he's in love-love. --Your father, who's not so young anymore,
Here.
She was one of Mom's friends. That explains why I remember seeing her.
I always thought that the children in those dramas
but when I'm put in the same position, I don't like it.
I don't know from a new mom, or my real mom.
S- still, even if you don't have any memories of her,
Her name is Daiichi Shiori-san, and she was your mom's best friend.
No! No! Sana-chan, what do we do!?
Not really.
We'll call it "Operation 'l'm Shocked, and I've Completely Had It With You!'"
All right then, goodbye now.
You're sure? Okay then...
Be back soon!
Good evening.
And that's not all, ma'am.
Okay, Father Hayama, the Nori-nori machine!
He's a shocking father, our Father Hayama!
 But I'm still a dandy Father Hayama. 
 My playful little mustache is my most charming point. 
 Oh my, why is Daddy singing... 
Goodness, Father Hayama, you're home early...
Then, judging from your reaction,
Father Hayama, don't tell me, could it be, possibly...?
You guys have it all wrong.
Your mother and I were good friends ever since high school.
Your mother was a cheerful person, whose expressions were always changing.
we get to eat lots of mochi rice cakes at New Year's!
Was she just a glutton?
Even if I'm depressed, or something is bothering me,
He's a boy. I can tell. For some reason, I can tell.
The name "Akito," from a very fine mother.
A fine dad, just like his son!
to always go along with the scenario.
...up to now, just for today,
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Sana-chan, you're always such a sorry fool.
Sorry. I know it's not fair to you,
"The Summer of My Promise - Part I"
it will be summer vacation, and there's this tasty TV drama that--
Absolutely no way!
The two conditions that were necessary for that to happen
One of them was that I would become a famous novelist.
Mm-hmm. I see... I had a hunch this would be coming up soon.
Three days?
Enjoy your outdoor school!
Enough rest-- okay!
What are you talking about? You get through constipation by force of nerve!
Now see here, line up there! Get on the bus at once! At once!
Principal Narunaru is finally making his first appearance!
What are you, a goldfish?
All right! I'll give it a shot!
--She's not even putting any sauce on it. --She's a wild child.
...but all of you ended up falling asleep.
What are you doing, Hayama!? Oh, you startled me!
No, you said all that on your own!
You've been acting strange lately, you know?
It's possible that maybe you...
The secret's out!
Now, now, it's all right, isn't it?
It'll be fine-fine. It'll be fine-fine.
...said something principal-like!
Sana is energetically mountain climbing
 The faraway stars that you can see, too... 
No way! I never heard about this!
Zenjiro-chan! Uchiyamada-kun!
The limbo dance is, by its very nature--!
--Let's limbo! --Let's limbo!
She disappeared!
I always thought she was no ordinary girl,
an8"Caution-- Cliff!"
"Caution-- Cliff!" A cliff?
--Hey!! --Let's limbo!
You've already got two previous convictions!
...are good at acting.
There are times when I think,
Maybe it does come into play a little bit.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
so BOY, take a look my way!
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
and for an American feeling, Texas!
Sensei, you're such a scamp.
I am Kurata Shizuka.
Grandma!
That's ridiculously big!
M- Mito-no-Goroko!?
This is Kusatsu Babbit, from the White Bat Kusatsu branch office.
Here you are, sir.
Please let your father have some time to relax without your mother around.
Oh, right, the buses left here about 6:30,
"Matchmaking for Mama?"
Hello.
Um, what sports are you good at?
I play a little ping pong.
Y- yes, hailing from Kusat-
The next gentleman.
Misako-san, you are the Kurata family's only child.
Mother, do you seriously think I am cut out to be the mistress of an inn?
"Prospective fathers return home"
A cute Sensei?
Abandoned child? You mean me?
With Misako-san's taste in husbands having changed, my strategy has failed.
Could the Madam just not wish to take over Kurata Inn?
It's unusual for her not to come visit
while the Kusatsu hot springs are over here.
Unusual? I don't know.
Wow, that looks delicious! You piled them awl into one stack for us?
Aren't these used to measure the temperature in the room and such?
Could it be some kind of nasty disease?
In that case, we'll challenge her to watch Sana-chan's commercial series next!
and at the upper end, by grandmothers and grandfathers,
an8"Ruse"
Grandma...
Hm? Who is that boy with the unusual aura coming off of him?
This is such a pleasure to meet you! I'm...
Tori?
This is so wonderful!
Hey, now...
This week's Sana-chan.
 Head clerk, head clerk, a fine head clerk! 
 That's what it takes to be a fine head clerk! 
W-who do you think you are!?
Who are you?
Those eyes... aren't human...
Time has a way of passing you by all at once.
We will see you later!
In dire straits,
to always go along with the scenario.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
What's the matter with you, staring off somewhere else while you're driving?
I always feel Relax,
Listen to this, listen to this! Zenjiro-sensei, you see...
in order to promote "Child's Toy"!
What were you thinking, taking your eyes off the road while driving?
It's so maddening! That article is a load of lies and hooey!
Asako-san wouldn't fall for that showy actor, after all, right? Right? Right?
Sana-chan!?
I told you, it's just a rumor.
I can't do that!
Wow, look at all of the press corps!
Ready? You do this, then this, then you say "It's Kim-Kim!"
Right!
but Asako-san hasn't seen Rei-kun at all. Takuya-kun sees her every day on location!
an8"Sea Urchin Head"
Hey, Tsuyoshi-kun, you've got Aya-chan!
Scatter!
This is Tsuyoshi... This is Tsuyoshi...
Hey! I can't see!
Do you usually use a chop on girls!?
This is Tsuyoshi! I'm getting to Kimuchi-kun's car ahead of them! Over.
That goes for bad boys and girls, too.
Yes...
You are upset over that, aren't you?
No, not at all. That's silly.
Mm-hmm.
Copy that. Continue your surveillance. Over.
They begin to like their counterpart more and more.
Y- yikes... I just remembered something weird...
No you don't! Even if those two really are seeing each other,
Tsuyoshi-kun, distract them by dancing! Over.
 Sneaking photos of them on their date? 
Okay, you reporters, that's all for tonight. See you again next week!
and scrape up enough to get you everything you want.
To see myself reflected in your eyes. That's all.
Great job, everyone!
Rei!
If you made that kind of promise,
There are many pesky entertainment reporters in the world,
Babbit has a close call, too! I hate snakes, after all.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
My Aoki award-winning Mama. The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
Yow! Yow! I knew they would be coming, but these arrows still sting.
But you two are holding hands tightly, aren't you?
You see? It's a handheld game.
Look at this picture of love-love.
It's just a bogus photo to begin with- Ah, damn it! Why, you...
As you can see, they are even kissing.
Who is he?
Damn it. I'll pass this chance up,
Here it comes, Rei-yan!
 and be afraid of entertainment reporters? 
--Sana-chan, what company are you keeping with Naozumi-kun? -- Here they come, ambush reporters. 
 Out of the way! Watch out! I got caught on one of you! 
Oh, thanks.
There is, isn't there? If it isn't Kamura-kun, then who?
How 'bout it, Sane-yan? Today's taping was easy, huh?
This guy is a snake.
Yo, Piyoko! Long time no see!
and before I realized it, it was 8:30!
Who is that guy?
Sorry, he's just this reporter that I know.
Hey there, Aya-chan and everyone!
You know what? I had three bowls of natto this morning!
Ah, he's thinking up something bad!
an8"And so..."
Hey, it's so dark, it's not turning out.
an8"An odd turn of events"
Sagami-san, there's a phone call for you.
No, I don't want to buy a membership to some scrub brush club!
For a while now.
Kurata...
Then it is a coincidence! Rei-kun called me out here, too!
Odd... isn't it?
I've been waiting for you.
Could I have a little of your time?
Is that true, even when someone gets hurt?
Not especially. My hand was just itchy.
What are you talking about? Morning tomato juice.
What!?
What?
You...
Did you know that your brother and Kurata Sana were going out together?
Sana-chan also appears to have had some circumstances surrounding her birth.
Cooperate with me, sister.
Don't panic, Sagami.
You dummy! Those are your underpants!
Here Hayama, wipe that up with the dishrag!
an8"Things go in an unexpected direction"
Listen up. A stegosaurus looks like this.
--I didn't know that. --Some glue and scissors, too.
 Pour in lots of soy sauce, 
 -and if you like it spicy, sesame chili oil is okay, too! 
Shoko-chan, Tak-kun, I'm back!
Welcome home!
Their dad might be a snake, but the children are growing up proper.
Akito, hurry and make me a stegosaurus!
Yay! Sana-chan said it was okay!
Kurata Sana...
There are hordes of folks who are thrilled by this material, after all.
I'm not going to change the way I work after this, either.
You don't say, you don't say.
Wasn't that incredible, Dad? We became friends with Sana-chan!
Hold on, that's Father Oki!
Huh? You mean Tsuyoshi-kun's father?
According to the personality assessment notebook,
That's what you say about times like these.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
And our usual classroom...
We will always stand by you, Tsuyoshi-kun!
and for an American feeling, Texas!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
That's pretty close to my house.
Do not forget to brush your teeth after meals.
No problem, no problem! No problem at all! So Mom, don't worry, okay?
Mm-hmm.
It's really no big deal.
but apparently, the guy doesn't have any other close relatives or anything.
Okay, all done.
Sana-chan, come over and visit us.
Tsuyoshi-kun!
Heh heh, I'm surprised you even came.
Hayama-san, it's just a little joke. A joke.
Huh? Aono-chan, what's the matter?
If anyone else tries to pick on you, Aono, then Big Brother will protect you.
and people say bad things about his family,
If you die, you won't be able to do any flower viewing!
Tsuyoshi-kun!
I know you've gone to a lot of trouble,
I'm... I'm just like he is.
"Whoosh! Bam!" you hit him with a preventive chop!
but still, if all you ever do is keep it in...
Anyhow, divorce is a situation between adults, right?
Brother...
"Those grounds were..."
N- no...
So, it was in order to help those kids?
To pick your old man up?
You can go... if you want.
Why did Tsuyoshi-kun turn away?
Dad! Dad!
Dad...
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Hmm... He seems to take after his dad, so he could go bald.
He will not go bald!
...panic!!
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
What kind of couple?
"Our teachers are ones who are about to get married,
Okay!
The one where the boys and the goils are on hostile toims with each othuh?
Is this only your classroom!?
Things have gone back to the way they were before.
Huh? How did you know?
Well...you know...
--Yeah!
Gomi-kun, you really do like gomi "trash", huh?"
Am I right, Mitsuya-sensei?
That's not true!
Were you lying when
you said we'd do the cleaning and laundry together once we got married?
Nonetheless, you sure take good care of that crazy five-storied pagoda of yours.
"Hey"?
Yeah, I said it! I'm the kind of man who says "hey" to his wife!
Tanaka-sensei is the worst! Why does he have to be so high-handed?
Ah, come to think of it, I've never seen you do any proper cleaning, Hayama!
"Shut up"?! Did you just say "shut up" to me!?
What are you, a cow?
There goes Kurata Sana!
--We can't beat her with words. --You guys are always making so much trouble-
What!?
Somebody come forward and represent the boys!
And ltami!
I heard everything!
Where did you hear it from?
"The classroom is split in half"
That's right! The Kamakura Shogunate!
Sensei, things are looking up.
You mean, Tanaka-sensei has "ish" shoes?
Those aren't the kind of "shoes" she means!
Another thing that's weird is the way he cries as he plays the harmonica.
Sensei, it's Social Studies...
Keep it down!
It's still better than your grating voice, you wrinkled hag.
This is an alarming situation! I'm reporting you to the principal!
You work it out with "guts"!
--Boys! Boys! Boys!
The girls win this one!
"The two of them walk a thorny path"
Aya-chan? Aya-chan?
Don't tell anyone.
Huh? Must have imagined it...
A class on learning the spirit of Japan?
Ah, I goofed up.
Now what is it?
Are you calling the spirit of Japan garbage!?
How could they!?
Let me handle this!
We don't like to fight! This is all because the boys are wrong!
You think I can become that sort of sage-like person?
No matter how dirty you leave your room, or how little you clean up,
Which means the girls get only noodles! That's too bad!
That was sneaky, you girls!
Mm-hmm.
I've had enough of this, myself.
There's a ditch there!
It's like this...
Change of plans!
A limbo dance tournament! Let's li-!
World's most contentious girls vs. boys-
I got him! The girls win one!
even point-one millimeters is okay with me!
Tanaka-sensei and Mitsuya-sensei, as well as?
Sugita Aya-chan.
I love you, Tanaka-sensei.
Boys, getting along is the most important thing!
Hey! What about the issue between the boys and the girls!?
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
"quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
What poor sense in naming.
Right, right.
Mayu-chan is so cool! Her dancing, and singing,
so it's a match-up that would only happen once,
--Okay, I'm off to go shoot --I worked meticulously
Ow! Thanks. Still, nobody is gonna celebrate it with me.
She found out he was dating someone else.
Zenjiro... lonely birthday...
How about we throw a birthday party for Zenjiro-sensei?
Wow! You mean it!? I can't believe it!
You are the elduhly boss of Kodocha Inn here, right?
--It's time for our first Shorokutai meeting. --You want me to make it funniuh?
Sorry I'm late, everyone. I'm Tobita Mayu.
Shooting on "Child's Toy" appears to have run long.
What? She's coming later than me?
Rei-kun, hurry!
Nice to meet you.
--In that case, I would like Kamura Naozumi-san to be my co-star. --There's going to be a drama part, too?
--In that case, I would like Kamura Naozumi-san to be my co-star. --I told you that before, didn't I?
And about this new song for Shorokutai, please allow me to sing the lead vocals.
Anyhow, I'd like to proceed with casting the heroine for the drama corner,
He said "I guess"!
Um, Sana-chan, will you invite Kamura Naozumi-kun, too?
If that's the case, then we will have to reconsider her appearing at all.
Good heavens, what was that producer Tsu thinking?
together with Sana-chan and Tomomi-chan.
So he says. Should we give up these discussions?
No one but me is fit to co-star with Kamura-san, after all.
No way. It's not as though we're doing rehearsals yet, right?
Sana-chan, I'm begging you!
U- um...
Um, we once appeared in the same production together.
Yes. We weren't in the same scene with each other,
--Oh, here. --What is it?
Do we make it Sana-chan?
No!
Woof! Woof woof woof!
Is that Zenjiro-san?
Oh, where's the dog- Kurata-san?
Um, I'm hoping we do well together on today's drama rehearsal-
You've done it, all right.
But I'm a dog, so-
I'm not supposed to talk, either, huh?
Sana-chan, have you been there the whole time!?
Is that the doll that was always exploding?
After many explosions, this is the finished product,
Now then, today is the last day, right? I'll go get my dog costume!
Okay, out! We'll use up to there.
from the beginning.
R- right! Right! You're absolutely right!
All this time...
Um... begging your pardon for a moment...
Kurata-san?
Please excuse me.
You want to go, huh? Sure you do.
-- chaka-poko-rin! 
What kind of performance is that? You're not out out to be pros.
--Mayu-chan... --Come on, Zenjiro-chan.

They're in love-love, huh? Tsuyoshi and Aya.
Huh? Are those cookies homemade?
Well, yeah.
Well, yeah!
Mm-hmm! They taste like cocoa.
Whew, the winter is hot this year. It's got me beat.
Huh? What's this?
N- nothing at all. I'm going to go on ahead, okay?
Akito-kun!

--Eriko-chan, maybe? --Tsuyoshi-kun!
Wow, what am I going to do?
Strange?
Oh, my! Not just a little strange, that's quite strange!
He seems to be avoiding me somewhat, too. What could be the matter?
Huh? Someone gave Tsuyoshi-kun a present? Who was it?
Tsuyoshi-kun has a real weakness when it comes to presents, huh?
Say then, are you saying
The possibility...
99!?
Uh, sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'm heading out first, okay?
That's dreadful.
Okay, when in doubt, go orthodox-
Zen-chan!
There aren't enough lifetimes in the woild that you could offuh me
Just a little.
Remembuh, my populah little Tsuyoshi-kun,
If he really likes that goil, then there's no problem, is there?
But for the longest time, I've had a weakness for presents.
This week's Zenjiro-chan!
Aah! I'm so attractive, I can't stand it!
 even though he has Aya-chan! That's no good! 
 Sana-chan, champion of justice! 
Hey, did you hear about Tsuyoshi-kun?
I heard, I heard! What's going to happen?
If he breaks up with Aya-chan, will he be going with this other girl?
Ah, Tsuyoshi is here!
Why, you!
You'll pay for this!
It wasn't...
They saw how, after I had given Tsuyoshi-kun that chocolate,
I'm sorry, Aya-chan!
I'm sorry!
Cheer up. Here.
Aono made this in school today. It's a present for you, Big Brother.
Hello!
We don't want it!
Aya-chan is being taken away!
Oh, you're wearing a cheerful face today.
They smell nice.

How is it being back in Kusatsu after ten-odd years?
Forgive me for being such a selfish daughter.
This water is terrific!
I smell conspiracy.

Yeah.
Ah, how agonizing. I wish we didn't grow old.
What's going on?
and go into retirement.
Excuse me.
Careful there, little lady.

Not to worry, I'll give you a crash course from scratch.
Don't say I didn't tell you so.
I won't allow Kurata Inn to be turned over to you guys!

Say, did you hear about Director Tarantaru's commercial?
R- really?
Party?
Come, okay? Okay? Everyone come, okay?
--So, she was serious about throwing this middle birthday? --Your tickets, your tickets! You can come with anyone you like!
Oh, dear! To be asked such a thing again!
Oh, this is so cute! You think Tsuyoshi-kun will like something like this?
That was something the girls told me was one-sided, on Hayama-kun's part.
The trumpet is stronger than karate!
Sure enough, karate is at an advantage, while the trumpet is at a disadvantage!
K- k- k-
That's right...
And I answered him so gleefully...
Tarantaru loves Japan's anime and kappamaki sushi rolls!

You're going to shoot a kissing scene?
No, I guess not.

Kamura Naozumi. Pleased to meet you.
That's it...
I can't! I can't! I can't!
Oh, no! Please catch Sana-chan!
I thought I wouldn't have a problem with it, since it was a kiss for work,
Oh, is that all?
Oh, come to think of it, why would I?

You're an idiot. Idiot, idiot.

But I'll be here on the 25th.
Wait, Akito! Akito!
Right now, you are...
You think so?
Oh, Naozumi-kun! You're already here? You couldn't wait until the party tomorrow?
My mind was swayed a little because of your invitation, Sana-chan,
Maybe I should give her a cawl.
Everyone have your glass?
Why not!? Why not!? Why not!?
Happy now?
If you didn't like them, you wouldn't use that figure as a decoration.

These are just the grubs, Tsuyoshi-kun. We have to find the head guy!
We might find him to be refreshing, enemy though he is.
What are you doing in something like this?
You're lousy at flying.
Still, flying is fun, huh?
You're scattering scales from off your face yourself, aren't you?
On, that's right.
I really do have to put you down.
I didn't want to take on this form, either.
Hey, wait the hell up!

Don't you speak Japanese!?

There's nothing more to it. Bankrupt means bankrupt.
But that means that all of your property will be seized, right?
 and the debt came crashing down on my shoulders. 
 Since I am the guarantor, there's nothing I can do. 
Why did you trust those people so easily?
I'll never forget the taste of your Thai-style curry!
What about asking the folks back home in Kusatsu if they could help out somehow?
Oh, that's my girl. The rain should stop sometime tomorrow, too.
 Starting today, our tomorrows are bright. 
That's just depressing.

What about food? If you don't eat right, you won't stay healthy.

What? What? I didn't hear that.
Sana-chan, you're having some bad luck, huh?
Is she really thinking about it?
Why did you suddenly cancel only Sana-chan!?
Um... l- I have to hurry home and flip the switch on my rice cooker...
Actually, this is who I am.
Let me come right to the point.
But Sana-chan's policy is not to be affiliated with any production studio.

Or would you like a bath first?
Um, Sana-chan, about your work...
Huh? What are you saying? I don't understand.

After all, I don't have any work, so I was thinking of joining Drea-Pro or somewhere.

Hang in there, Sana-chan!
That's pretty wishful thinking.
Thank you.

Still, President,
It's an essay.
That's in pretty poor taste.
I could, if I told him I wouldn't write for his company anymore, or something.
She said her deadline was tomorrow morning, right?

I cannot go along with her attending Jinbo Middle School!
W- what was that?
Thanks to Zenjiro-san.
You're getting more wrinkles.
classroom comportment, and other considerations,
so he can advance to Jinbo Middle School-
...is because of an issue with the content of the guidance
Your face is cracking, lady.
You have matters that come before your grades
Thank you, Zenjiro-sensei!
Thanks to you, Zenjiro-sensei, it looks like I can safely move on to middle school,
so this is an expression of my thanks.
The chills won't go away. We're done for the day.
Take-chan, you're so warm.
"My Shinichi-chan is going to test for Kaimei Middle School."
I'll bet he's on his way home.
Okay.
It was, huh?
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI
it's all "waah!" over here,
the tale of where Take-chan and Sana-chan,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
Let's first watch this replay film from last week.
There will be a private tutor coming to our home instead.
Damn! It hurts!
Sorry to butt in while you're being serious, but your dad brought home sushi.
Not really.
There must have been something that happened!
 and if you call to him with a kind voice... 
"Not really. None of your business."
Ah, they're airing it tonight?
Of course I'm surprised! I'm shocked and stunned!
"Kitchen garbage, construction worker, Amitabha, seaweed."
Last night's "Late-Night Chaos Theater."
Say, it's been in the sports papers and stuff,
--Urgh!
Sana-chan, way to go!!
Come in.
Aw, I'm bored.
Gomi!?
What the?
--Did you hear about Hayama-san? --Know what Hayama-san did?
And let's not have you smile things away today
an8"Pass"
Today, I made your favorite, omelet and rice, Shinichi-san.
an8"Gossip"
Mom?
I'm sorry. I'm disturbing your lunch, aren't I?
--Gossip... gossip... Go! Go! --Did you hear about Hayama-san shoplifting?
Huh? I thought he was just here, talking to Kurata. Damn!
Hello, is that you, Shinichi? Why are you calling me here?
Please raise your head, Gomi-san.
Dad, I... I...
What about you, Shinichi?
And our line is just...
--What?
Why, you! You thinking of turning your back on us!?
What's wrong, mister!?
Ah... it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Bye Bye Bye Bye
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
I've caught a cold...
Click...
-- This year, I'm not going to do  --Ah, Sana-chan, is that valentine's chocolate?
-- any drive-by chocolating.  --Ah, Sana-chan, is that valentine's chocolate?
Huh? But you must have been watching something interesting, right?
No! Absolutely not!
when declarations of love are exchanged.
My own little brother is in kindergarten, and he'll get ten of them.
Ace-in-the-hole?
Tsuyoshi-kun, you can look forward to tomorrow.
But I can't keep myself from smiling.
--Nice job, everyone! --Nice job, everyone!
Well, I've got a drama taping with my boyfriend now, so bye-bye!

Oh, yeah?
I've done it again.
This is bad!
"Oh" nothing!
Everyone is waiting for you. Really.
Studio crew...
Cutting out Sana-chan's scene won't have any effect on the story,
What!?
It always ends up like this. Always.
I've always thought it was good enough. That it was the only way to go.
Go on, eat, eat! There's as much as you want!
--Oh, yes.
Long ago...
Or so I thought.
And so, both of us were hopeless.
This is no time for the past to be bugging you,
Eat it! You'll feel better! It has my love baked right in!
Excuse us! We're getting off!
I will go back!!
Gojo Takeshi has arrived! I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience!
Hey! Hisae-chan!
I'm always, always watching you. You look so handsome when you're playing tennis.
I'm a girl...
and guys who look like it doesn't matter to them.
Everyone, have some, have some!
Chocolate to make your love, courage, good cheer and luck bloom!
I've got a bad feeling.

DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Mou man tail
Oh, I'm not going to be all that active next time.
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, episode 46,
"Kodomo no Omocha"
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
Wow, Sana-chan's first essay!
And so, Sana-chan's first essay, the one that had everyone's hearts tightly wound...
The book is selling well,
This isn't a bargain banana sell-off, you know.
Um... is this going to be on TV?
Well, forgive her, okay?
We don't need any guys. You can just pipe down.
Well, let's see... Sana-chan acts weird at school.
about Mami-chan in her essay.
Swoosh!
Mm-hmm, that's what it looked like.
I would have had to write about what Hayama is trying to get past.
Rei-kun!
This is dangerous! All right! All right!
 Faltering and fretting, too-la-loo-la-loo. 
The best thing when you've got a cold heart is some hot cocoa.
"Akasaka Hotel French cuisine full course Complimentary ticket"
Sana-chan didn't want to write about what Akito-kun did in the past,
so she couldn't write about Mami-chan, either.
So that's why.
Having bullied Mami-chan has also become a scar on Akito-kun's heart.
 Rice cake, bump, bump, line, line, triangle, 
--Milk! --Milk!
M- ilk, you say? Very well.
--I wish I could stay like this a little bit longer. --Take-chan, you dropped your meat.
Aren't you worried about how Sana-chan is doing?
I don't want to go... I don't want to go to school...
Would you care for a bento?
but under the circumstances,
Of course.
--and "I'm the Daughter," we can build ourselves a gigantic house! --gwaenchansseumnida, kwenchanayo...
Yatsugatake is a mountain range
in Nagano Prefecture.
Okay!
Sana-chan hasn't been home yet?
Take-chan, where have you been?
I'm sorry to make you have to do that.
It's possible that this is a special privilege that only children get.
Ah, then you asked Sana to?
Rei-kun! Huh? The car...
It's back! Want a ride?
Mami-chan...
I understand... I understand that you didn't mean to hurt me by doing it.
an8"A little while later"
When you sing this song, your worries will go
so resolve when to give up
Tidak apa-apa, Nday kambay kambay
It's always the same old nonsense,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality
Maybe I'll stay here with you, Take-chan, for the rest of my life.
You really are amazing.
Earthquake!!
so please leave, remember?
A tragic sight to behold.
Not to worry!
Oh, could that be, could that be?
Actually, construction has fallen behind,
No, it's wrong, it's wrong. It would be dangerous! I'm not going!
I guess I could do that...
No I couldn't!
Can I come stay over at your place tonight, Take-chan?
looking back while returning from shopping scene!
"At the scene of Zenjiro-sensei's tasty work"
Do you know what that says?
"Are you okay with this!?"
The flowers of our love are in bloom!
Has the snake reporter appeared again after a long absence with another scheme?
Kurosaki-kun, you've got to give them to me if you've got them!
Mm-hmm, I sure did.
That's my Aya-chan! You've got a good eye for men!
Huh? If you are, Aya-chan, then I will, too!
This is the Sana-chan drawing song!
I get the feeling that something is going to happen with Hayama-kun here.
Mm-hmm. A little uneasy...
--"Gojo here"? --Sana-chan?
See you later.
Oh, yay!
This will not do.
Sana should be here, dancing around.
U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
The mysterious white bat straight man, Babbit.
But then it seemed like, suddenly, all of that melted right away.
You really are amazing.
That was all your strength then, too.
Now, do you know the name of the woman who he was seeing at that time?
Gojo Takeshi is... Sana's true father?
 Rei-kun is being mean, he's being very mean, 
Yes, step right up and see for yourself, here are the pictures that prove it!
Mama, I'm home! Huh?
an8"Final confirmation?"
Hello!
That dummy has the nerve to call me forgetful!? That jerk!
Ka-ching!
Surprised you?
That was in bad taste.
Huh? You didn't hear what we were just talking about?
That's enough. It's all in the past for you now.
That comes later! Now, head for my house, and let's go!
Take-chan lives by himself, you see, and doesn't eat decently,
S- Sagami...
Shimura-san, make some yummy food for him, okay?
Wait just a minute.
Wait just a minute.
That much is pretty obvious, huh Take-chan?
an8"Sure enough, she couldn't tell them"
Good morning, Take-chan!
That takes some nerve, huh!? Even I haven't called you that yet!
an8"On location!"
Incidentally, there are rumors that you crashed the home of a flight attendant...
--makes me feel better, too. --Try growing up a little, okay?
He's going to die!
Okay, here goes.
That's what we call "hitting on someone"!
Yes, Kurata residence.
Y- you've got to be kidding me! Absolutely no way!
And there you have it.
This guy will be the eyewitness.
Yumi, run!
Dad!
Yeah, I tripped over my own feet. Huh?
Whew! I wonder if it's going to rain during tomorrow's location shoot, too.
Mm-hmm.
Take-chan, you're growing young again.
Aah! Dad!
Yo, Take-san, I heard you accepted the Golden job.
--Right!
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
Gwaenchansseumnida, kwenchanayo
I may he a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ha-ha-ha-ha-hang!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
I don't quite understand him.
I know your secret.
"Heart-Pounding Twice Over"
while I was on location!
It's not about food.
What!?
As long as she's dressed like this, Sana is going to dance.
Mama, do you know something?
 When things are hard, don't think about it! 
It says you have the personality of an honest person
the neighborhood association works hard to try to run the boy out.
Rats! Onda-san is in charge of a different book!
Sensei told me to look out for Sana-chan...
"Elsewhere, what about Hayama???"
I wonder how much she's making.
Hayama, how are you doing?
This is ringing, here...
Hey, this is ringing, here!
Do you know anything about Sana-chan's... er...
Geez, you've got to be careful around that guy.
I got it! This is it! This is it!
There are many patrons and members of the press corps out in front of the hall.
My pretty student!
Akito-kun, Principal Narunaru came, and Zenjiro is here, too.
That's the boy, Akito-kun!
Mm-hmm! Just like that.
By the way, does Sana-chan have any boys that she is good friends with?
Oh, right.
Kissed him!?
Honest!
Oh, I can't hear this thumping!
Still, I think you should relax a little bit.
Whew, that really does relax you.
Yes, yes, the characters for "person" and "enter" are often mistaken.
Be careful, now!
Everyone is still nervous.
that took a stand to save her village from an army that was oppressing them.
Did you hear that? He spoke Japanese.
Hey, Kamura-kun!
Whoa! That perverse Hayama is here too, huh?
What's going on!! I'm shocked!
Please enjoy the performance until it ends.
My fields have been burned!
Sana-chan's got panache, all right.
Forget about the bad things, huh? That's it, Sana-chan, hang in there!
Tom!

In dire straits,
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 17; the fated series finally reaches its climax!
Surprises, hiccups, and butt-shaped rice cakes!
and for an American feeling, Texas!
it's time to get out of there!
Yes, he does appear to require some rest, but for now, he seems to be all right.
and he'll probably feel lonely if no one is here when he wakes up.
The happy times have finally come, after all.
Word sure does travel fast, huh?
So? How is his condition?
A prolapsed stomach from eating watermelon isn't too swift.
Thank you.
Wouldn't this usually be bad?
You're finally starting to get good roles coming your way now.
Really? I'm glad to hear that.
Boom, boom, boom, like that! And your popularity is going to skyrocket, too!
"Flesruoy ecarb!" What was that?
"My dad died"!?
Ah! The snake is stomping in with his shoes still on!
You were all saying such good things about Take-chan before, weren't you!?
Gojo-san will be burned out for his upcoming Golden Drama, right?
Gojo-san should place his stake in his upcoming, bigger job, right?
What would be best for Gojo-san?
Move the desk, please... Sana-chan... Sana-chan?
Rei-kun!
Right? Right, Take-chan?
I think that's definitely the best thing to do, too.
Mm-hmm, all right.
It took you long enough, Take-chan! Of course you do!
Really.
an8"Sana-chan sings"
-- So we'll be together  -- So we'll be together 
you nitwits!?
there are good reporters and bad reporters.
Now, would you tell me what you are thinking right now?
Are you planning to make this into an article for after Gojo-san dies?
When one door closes, another one is opened.
What about "Chaos Theater"? That is your breakout show, right, Gojo-san?
People have said all sorts of things about our relationship,
I never liked this last scene to begin with!
Take-san, this might be a bit hard on you, with you on the mend. Are you okay?
Start!
Let's do it.
Ooh, I'm going to cry!
Take-

--Nothing else would leave a greater reminder of who you are. --What could have happened to Sana-chan,
I'm sorry, Shimura-san.
Let's release a CD, Sana-chan! A CD!
If she would shed some tears, it would alleviate her sorrow somewhat.
Oh... then, what should we do?
We fooled you!
You lied to me. You're not at my side, are you?
What are you doing? You almost got run over, you know!
Ghost?
-- Gotta be in wide-open top form, whirring around on Komawari power. 
 Don't give in, fight on, poppy-pop-pop-pop! 
Sana-chan...
--and Osakan puhformuhs' front teeth that stick out too far are their lives. --Sana-chan, wait up.
All for a show such as that!
Who are you, then?
Sana-chan didn't come to school again today, huh?
Why are you crying, Tsuyoshi-kun? You're making Babbit-
Did something happen?
It was like this that other time, too.
--Huh? Sana-chan?
We'll help you look too.
Take-chan! I missed you! I missed you!
 Hot coffee! Here, thanks for waiting! 
How about if I live here together with you? And then...
How do you know that Sana-chan would have come someplace like this?
I wonder if the buses are running.
It's too far.
--Off, to Yatsugatake!
Anywhere else would be okay,
--A- avalanche!?
I- it can't be...
She did come! Sana-chan is here!
I want us to stay like this always. Always. Always.
I don't know. What do you think, Mami-chan?
If you're there, answer me! Even if you're not there, answer me!
What? That's a good question...
There's no telling when this thing is going to fall as it is!
No!
We're staying together!
Hayama, your hand... it's bleeding, isn't it?
Have I... become lonesome?
--Is that right? --It's Sana-chan!
not to mention Hisae-chan and Mami-chan.
All right, done!
Oof.
It's all crazy over there,
it's all "waah!" over here,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
and that is because of Sana-chan and... uh... what was his name again? Um... uh...
Mm-hmm, I'm sure that was it.
Oh! You there, goils A and B, you have some idea? Speak, speak.
What's with you? Don't get all worked up over something like this.
No time for that! Study! Study!
Guys, stand by me, okay? Okay? Okay?
It's hopeless.
There was one still left in my desk.
--Where could Akito-kun have gone? Why would he- --Why, Hayama!?
It's lame that all of us have to stay for after-school class.
Oh, man...
Come on! Come on!
What is this, Tanaka-sensei?
That's right! I just remembered!
Andoh-sensei!
Everyone, value your friendships. I will call off the test.
--Yay!
Thank you, Andoh-sensei!
 Here a slope, there a slope, ups-a-daisy,

I refuse to acknowledge those two's relationship over just this!
It's genuine!
A thorny path!
This is embarrassing...
Even I, once called the divine Big Brothuh Z, am really about to snap.
Nevuh mind that, the issue here is Sana-chan and Hayama.
Keep your arm at your side, make a tight fist, and twist as you...
Strike! Strike! Strike!

So, did you have fun today?
He did it again...
Somehow, I couldn't turn away...

Because today I'm starting my first year of junior high!
Look, in the mirror, there's a new me.
You're gonna be like how you used to be.
Who knows?
Fresh out of the oven middle school students.
But about a third of the students will be coming from other schools.
Today we came to do a surprise interview with you!
But I really don't know what to ask, please tell me.
I don't know how middle school life will be... How will it be?
Isn't that Sana-chan? She's singing over there!
How fun, Tomoe-chan!
You can't even decide how to cut your own hair!
This is a graceful young lady.
If you walk around Tokyo you'll see celebrities.
This is also the first time I heard of it. My name is Matsui Fuka.
Nice to meet you.
This is Fuka, another new friend.
When I'm at hometown, people say I look a lot like you.
Now that would be interesting!
Ehh... that's great! Next time we can try!
The bad omen from my tea leaves make some people look forward to it too.
To all the new students, welcome to Jinbo Middle School!
The school's policies are honesty, love and courage.
Those two ever there keep staring at us.
You want to see what I can do? Is the way I talk really that strange?
Pointing and laughing at people behind their back is so rude!
But don't laugh behind people's backs!
It doesn't suit you.
Hayama, huh? Your boyfriend?
Fighting! They're fighting!
No, no, no, my mortal enemy.
Then I don't want to meet him now.
part b
That's right. It looks like he just came out of karate.
What's wrong with you?!
This is the first time I made someone's nose bleed. I have mixed feelings.
Sana-chan hasn't changed.
Why did you fight with him, eh?
Back then when I was going home...
What if you had gotten black listed on the first day of school?
I really want to tell you her name but I want you to guess.
Came in the washroom... and she became my bathroom friend...
- Where is Sana? - In the Nurse's office.
Is she your girlfriend? Cute!
No such thing?
No... I don't realize I was sleeping.
No, no, no... for the third time.

It is very ridiculous, you idiot!
You're the one who's ruined me!
Wait up! Aki!
How could he have escaped so fast?
Every time I see his face I get so mad.
Aki caught me off guard then and suddenly kissed me!
When I get to that age I will too...
11 years old, we go out. 12 years old, we kiss for the first time.
But then Aki messed this all up!
...don't tell her it was for money, even if it kills you!
Wait! Hey! You bastard!
This great thing happened and you're not happy?
If you want people to praise you, just say so Rei-kun.
It's nice to see that you're taking it so seriously. Sana-chan!
Sometimes! Really only sometimes.
Wait! Don't close it!
Haven't seen you all day... Hmm? What do you wanna say?
It's about yesterday's incident.
Then what?
What happened in kindergarten and last year... it's not the same.
What?
there goes 2 cups... plus 2 earlobes...
Please continue watching.
Anyway, we're very sorry!
- Here... - Thank you, lady.
Thanks, lady!
I'm very confident on how flexible I am.
Yeah. Tsuyoshi-kun?
He took it and drew gold and silver colored Auku.
Call him, Fuka!
I'm sorry, I've said too much, I'm sorry.
The script isn't done yet, hope it'll be ok.
That's true!
Eh? So I didn't change?
You only realized it after you split up?
But when he was in elementary school, girls did hate him as if he was a hairy caterpillar!
Hey! Hayama Aki!

Is kissing on the lips love?
Hmm... I don't know about that...

Kamura-kun, I heard your character is in love with Sana-chan's character.
Please tell us the truth, Naozumi-kun.
But I heard from the producer Naozumi-kun's role is more important.
We can't see her for three months?
How can a squirrel know how to write?!
Club activities are starting today.
She's like a ghost member.
That director is really scary. His spirit will come out...
She said she was very embarrassed with her illusion of love.
Akito-kun, are you running away?
But... I thought you didn't have karate today.
I don't think that's it.
I never said that. And if you keep acting this way, I won't worry about you.
Fuka, it's not like I'm going to an uncivilized tropical island.
You ate a lot.

What do you want to tell me?
Ok, I got it. You'll tell me when I get back, right?

Rei-kun, I can't call Tokyo. I don't like this.
Let's go, if you stay here too long a bear might come out.
I didn't have too much time myself.
Eh? That means...
...me and Naozumi-kun?!
First you draw one mountain... then comes the water...

...and then another arrow for the other eye...
Thanks...
No, thanks. Nao is allergic to peppery flavored gum.
I don't believe it, you can't?
Hey hey, you're going too far.
Didn't I tell you? I have your naked baby picture.
No! Throw that away!
I understand, if you don't like it I'll keep it a secret.
Don't look.
I'll tell you for sure, next time.
I'm looking for my brother...
Guest...
Hey hey, it's too early to fall for Mako yet.
This silence and uncertainty is actually what I wanted.
It's very unusual for you to forget your line like this.
No.

Here, I hope it isn't too much trouble...
Is it a love letter to your boyfriend?
What is Hayama doing?
What did you say?
Do you want to hear me say it, Hayama-kun?
I want to show him that I can get a new boyfriend too and be happy without him...
I want him to feel how it is...
So please help me?!! Huh?!
I need to 'save face'...
- I'll call... - No need...
I'm very surprised...
Wait up, Akito-kun...
Mind your own business, get lost!
I'm fine, I haven't changed at all.
Does it bother you that Takaishi brought her?
How long will it take?
Harajuku, Harajuku! Harahara! Jukujuku!
My appearing in this drama is too little!
Don't say things like this!
Takaishi-kun's feelings for me...
How passionate...
I want to eat Katsu-don.
I'll have curry steak then.
That's also the steak!
The steak burger!
After all you don't see each other much.
In sixth grade, you guys used to get along so well.
- Fuka... - Takaishi-kun...
Takaishi-kun was in shock when he heard that...
I couldn't say anything because you were avoiding me!
I'm exhausted...
I see, I understand...
Come visit me again!
Sorry for bothering you!
Thanks for helping me out today, Hayama.
It's the restaurant that Dad always gets take out from.
We've been discovered!
It's a postcard sent by Sana-chan.
Did you get a postcard from Sana-chan?
Is Mama still running around avoiding deadlines?
I wonder how Hayama is doing...
Is it about his father?

Sana-chan, are you ok?
You're both doing really well. Very emotional.
It's bound too tight, I can't stand it.
Excuse me!
Sana-chan, I really like you.
Is Sana-chan still sinking into it?
Really?
I really do like her.
Will you two be falling into love with each other?
Ok, that's enough for today.
I can't get it right.
Love... love... love love...
I didn't think Asako-san would've been the leader!
Bra?! What's it look like!
Must be the monkey that stole it.
A bra... Sana-chan, stay a young girl.
We don't have that kind.
Does it hurt?
Sana-chan, do you want me to drive a little bit slower?
Heh heh, Hayama.
There's a lot of gossip from the managers and actors.
I didn't mean it like that.
and she's Miss X from the group New Half, age 23.
These are actually people who believe this book.
Why don't you talk to them for a while?
The sun's ready to set, we should go home now.
Let's go, Sana-chan.
What are you talking about? It's all lies.
This is a lie.
Sorry, but it's my true feelings.
Are you going to go into the net of love?
Hmm, Rei-kun!
So why?!
If you were me what would you think? If you were in the same situation as Asako.
If it were me? Well... umm...
Let's go!

Once the book comes out, what is going to happen to Mama and me?
Akito-kun! Hello!?
--Thank you very much! --Sana-chan, I watch you all the time!
Thanks.
Well then, if anything happens...
She looked like a brilliant queen of the stage!
I had a scheduling meeting with my editor, Onda,
where tensions are running high.
What shall we do?
--Scatter! --All right!
Why are you so stingy?
if you're going to chase him away like this.
By pushing this, I can reach Hayama... Yeah, all I have to do is push...
Kurata Sana-san, who is currently appearing in several commercials,
This sure comes as a surprise, huh?
Sana-chan is still in elementary school, and all...
Kurata-san! Please give us a statement!
Don't you think she will be deeply scarred by this incident?
then I would go on living as a strange woman?
--who had abandoned her child, --What would you do when we got there? You won't be able to see her.
It was something that I had secretly made up my mind
Sana, you will join Gekidan Komawari.
but at least become a little more famous than other children.
Mama will also become famous, through her novels.
What would I do, if Mama was planning to send me away someday?
She's planning to give us some honest answers!
Naturally, I imagined what all of you were going to say.
To me, everything that you are saying is clichd, and sure enough,
I wonder how many of you have read my book all the way through to the end.
I knew they wouldn't be.
Bye!
--I told you, I did this, knowing how she felt. --Mama...
--Something so cruel-- you're cold! --Enough, Rei-kun...
Huh? That's Sana-chan on the back!
Hayama-kun, for today, I'll let you take care of her.
What's with you?
In dire straits,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
...for two.
It proves they're alive!

I'll never forgive myself.
The mood... has improved.
Don't push her too hard.
I don't care what you say! I won't agree! No!
I'm not gonna do anything that's bad for me.
Of course, she was beaten up pretty badly.
Don't act worried in front of them because I got injured.
Damn her...
Fine.
Does it hurt really badly?
Sorry for making you all worry!
Naozumi...
They're really low...
That's a reporter's job... they have to make a living too!
I can't be like you.
That's right, they beat me up because they wanted me to quit.
Compared to the pain of giving birth, this is nothing.
Piling up?
This is Naozumi-kun.
It's the other way around, Sana-chan has taught me so much.
Have you ever seen that?
Sorry, sis. Don't use such impolite words.
Can you see the bandage on my leg?
It's your brother who did this with me...
- It sounds like it hurts a lot... - And it left a big impression.
Use your experience to improve your acting.
It still hurts a bit, but I feel full of energy inside.
Well, I hate you too!
Get better, get better, get better...
I never heard Sana-chan say anything about this.
This says they're lovers.
long eyelashes...
Thick and bloody Ishida-kun, what did you say?
Because she had a relationship with Naozumi-kun, she turned me down.
You can tell I'm not lying by looking at my eyebrows!
I told Hayama I would help him get together with Sana,
But... I can't believe it.
And my relief is really thanks to you.
But I don't mean to replace Sana.

Yes, she doesn't usually get depressed about little things.

She will definitely recover after one more day of rest.
I heard that she's having some trouble, so I came right away.
You shouldn't have come.
I've already taken so many days off...
But how am I supposed to work if I don't forget them?
Can't work... Ah!
Eh? But I'm so hurt right now.

Huh. I can't do it. Not even this morning.

I'm not going to ask for anything in return.
Is that so?
Well, see you later!
Sorry, Onda, please clean up this mess.
Oh, is that it? What a marvelous building.
The mansion that everybody built is going to be burned down tomorrow.
That's right. It's not a time to worry and cause everyone trouble.

I didn't get to hear the reason, but I am sure he was talking only about me.
Ooops, wrong sign! This is for another sequence!
Thank you. I'm glad, Naozumi-kun.
Who... could it be...?
No way! We can't spend money so excessively.
...a little...?
Ah... they were watching.
The only problem is the rent price. Can we trim the price a little?
Ok!
Let's go, Naozumi!
No way! Let me go, Brad!
No, Brad! I told you to let me go!
We'll do it tomorrow.
Makes you worry, right?
You will practice your lines today as well.
What do you mean? Why did you call?
Help!
If only you hadn't come here... Go home!
Ah, thank you, mister! I am Kurata Sana. Huh?
Yes. And if I may ask, you are... ?
I am Naozumi's mother.
Looking for an apartment, right?
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Tidak apa apa, Nday kambay kambay

and then later comes the whimpering,
When you sing this song, your worries will go

I'm Kurata Sana, I'm an actress in 1st year of middle school.
This person's a choreographer of Broadway that I've never seen before, Michelle Hamilton.
You're doing too much on your own, I don't agree with this.
Go home!
I'm Naozumi's... mother.
I'm sorry, Sana Kurata, Naozumi Kamura.
Could it be?
That's why I was pushing them out in your place.
Um...
I suddenly came to see you...
Telling you I'm your mother after all this time-
Naozumi...
S-stop it! Release me!
Anyways, read the user's manual carefully.
Black Babbit, you're mean!
Yes... So, room 3025... there it is!
Sagami-san!
Call me Bernie.
I fell for Rei at first sight.
Can you do something about this 'tsun tsun'?
It will be done soon, so expect something good.
Brad...
Huh? Didn't you want to know?
Shop?
Bernie made them.
Thank you, but...
It's nothing!
But it's not my problem.
But this 'Naozumi' is your real kid, isn't he?
Naozumi, Naozumi, Naozumi!
you can laugh it away, excuse me, I must be going.
and for an American feeling, Texas!
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
...that you ran away from the mansion...
Michelle's here! Wait a sec! We didn't ...
Sicil, do you hear it? Mama's voice?
The dream of becoming a pro dancer disappeared there.
So what if you can't dance!
Sicil. Even if you can't dance, your mama can't just leave you alone.
Everything turned out well!
Naozumi-kun! What are you looking at?
That person calling herself my mother...
Hey, Naozumi, do you like this?
Why now, all of a sudden?
Here, have all you want.
Here, this is your room!
I'm sorry, something got into me.
But here in New York now that I've met you, I'm not so confident anymore.
Goodbye!
Naozumi! Don't go!
That is all for today! Let's dig in now!
Welcome Sicil! Nice to have you in our home!
Bon appetit!
Hey Sicil, please don't hug me so close!
I just thought you were playing it.
Ah, the trumpet? I can't play this well.
It was the same with me. I knew right away.
I see.
You were always kept at the mansion, so it's natural you're enjoying the outside world.
Why doesn't Sicil cook for Babbit with love?
I know how you feel when you're worried about Sicil. But now Sicil is unstable...
Brad... what did you just say?
Sicil is my sister?
This has nothing to do with math!
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...

I don't want to know anything anymore.
Naozumi-kun!
I'm fine, I'm with Brad taking cover from the rain.
What do you mean, 'what'?! Bastard! I'm very angry!
I'll do anything for Sicil.
Has Naozumi lost his way?
Ah yes, this is Sagami Rei.
Was it that person?
Please don't tell anyone about this. You didn't say anything to Sicil, did you?
It's very good.
...you think the soup I made is good.
What is it?
This week's useful English word.
Hi.
I am so embarrassed.
Please do.
I've helped out!
Kida baba is 'no problem' in Chinese.
One is nearly late, the other has a cold and needs to rest.
Let's begin practice.
It seems worthy of pity.
Welcome home.
He's still feverish, so he's staying at Yuko-san's.
I tried so hard to see him at the mansion, but he left immediately.
Naozumi is trying to avoid me, he's sick of me.
I don't want a child who cannot dance, I don't want her!
Yes, I am, who are you?
Once your lips touch, you can't change your mind.

Her husband is the king producer, Gary Hamilton.
Where is Yuko?
I will always be your friend.
Thank you.
Naozumi, did he say anything dreadful?
Naozumi's heart is already mine.
Someone called Yuko Mizukuchi.
Your age didn't fit the category either.
You think there is nothing you can't do.
Right? Why? Why? Why?
Mister!
The script, the art, the cast, everything must be five-star quality.
You and I neglected Naozumi.
Yuko only wanted to use Naozumi.
I tried asking Gary Hamilton...
Can you please tell Naozumi the truth?
I am here. Contact me if anything happens.
I've decided to star in a musical.
No, no, no, no... yes, yes, yes... no, no, no, no...
Here, have some water.
Who's this customer who still wants to eat our store's pizza?
- Congratulations, Yuko. - Thank you.
If you put it that way, I'm very happy.
Really?
When you sing this song, your worries will go

Starting tomorrow, you'll return to practice. Do you hear me?!
I thought you guys were together.
Sicil's missing, the curry rice is cold. What do I do? Asako...
Just as you thought? Naozumi-kun, did something happen?
Boy, it's dangerous for kids to be in this kind of place at night.
Hey, this is the first time I've heard that Naozumi-kun's father is Gary.
Yes. Yes. I understand.
- This way! - OK.
I'm going to ask him to search this area.
She hasn't returned by this time. How long do you expect me to wait?
Right now, my Sicil could be...
And a free ticket for your wife as well, of course. Bye.
I'm sorry.
You know where she might be?
What's the matter?!
When you have a fever, you must rest.
Sicil!
Let me pass.
Who are you?
...there's a girl... who's fallen down the ditch.
Right. It was Sicil's favorite place as a child.
It's not Sicil.
We've just received breaking news.
Don't worry. As long as you're safe.
Don't argue. Hurry up and do something.
In my student years, I was termed a diving queen. I'm going in.
The wrong person again?
Thank you.
Thank God, you're safe.
I said before I dislike disobedient children.
Because you're a burden, I abandoned you.
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU

Sana-chan.
Why did we come here in the first place?
Naozumi-kun wouldn't have had to go through something like this.
Was this such a good idea?
Naozumi-kun was right there to back me up.
What?
Want to go back? To Japan.
And this time...
It's fine with me.
Hey old man, are you really seriously considering that?
Asako, I'm home!
Welcome home, Rei!
Bernie.
I... that is...
Naozumi.
Papa...
Take care of Ramsy-san for me, ok?
To tell the truth, it's Makubagyapan-san.
Yeah, let's go.
I see. I'm going to go see Naozumi now.
We're planning to go somewhere that has tasty desserts.
I have to say it.
I might still see you again someday.
Don't lean out the window of a running car or you'll hit your head.
I'm kidding, don't worry...
Please hurry! We have to catch Naozumi!
This way!
So, thank you for coming today!
Great, Gary! We're waiting to enjoy it!
Rei, Sana, and Naozumi wrote these letters.
Inside, they explained why they went back so suddenly.

The one who looks like that guy in Japan, the American, Brad.
This is their only child, Sicil Hamilton.
The amazing bat Babbit.
Having a really tough and bumpy time, Naozumi-kun.
Ahh, I feel like I can heave a sigh of relief.
It's hard to believe that they're still kids.
But it's a happy thing that everyone's staying together.
What are you talking about, Unagi-san?
This place you have to jump up and down...
Bunto bunto jump jump
I'll be more stricter now so be prepared.
Ah, this is so tiring...
I once loved Yuko... I treated it as love but Yuko didn't think of it that way.
She couldn't succeed despite that passion which drove her to abandon me.
but in the end it still affected you.
Sana...
Crying, laughing and steaming, sticking your tongue out
Tendon, udon, oyakodon
No... Nothing...
Do you know that's a marching line?
Looks like this? Hmm... What language calls it lapa?
I've always loved to see musicals and wanted to watch them with Papa.
Hi!
everything was my fault.
- What did you say? - Calm down.
I quit too.
Mama, Shimura-san, Onda-san, Maro-chan, are you fine?
She had her just desserts!
I see...
Yup.

Wait!
Wait, Sana-chan!
Absolutely no good?
Don't use up all your energy.
Hey, that's a bit too much.
You really have no talent.
I must make it a success.
Guess so.
Me too.
Hurry up and get ready!
Sana-chan!
Cause he's still got a little kid's taste.
Maeda-san! Why are you here? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Don't worry, I've done everything that I need to.
Sana-chan...
You'll never have talent.
Naozumi-kun.
Can you feel it?
an8Sensei doesn't get excited.
Erk, they've started!
What?
Really? I just pretended it was a big school concert.
Uh, no, nevermind.
Goodbye, Mother.
No, we really do have to thank you.
So rumor has it that the Japanese child star Naozumi Kamura is your son.
It's always the same old nonsense,
KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI KU-RAI
and the whole earth is spinning the wrong way.

I'm satisfied. I'll let Sana handle the rest.
Sensei, I brought Sana with me.
Huh? What about you, Mama?
Wow, what a surprise, right? Surprising, surprising, right?
The birth mother is at a loss.
My mother got herself a boyfriend, and hardly ever came home.
But, I just couldn't tell him that we were having a baby...
I wanted to know...
Don't you have anything more important to ask?
Yeah, "Samu."
Keiko-san, you have a ring. You're married.
Y- yeah...
What's going on!? Akito-kun, do you know anything!?
Oh, you guys!
an8"I am not Sana-chan"
You know, though, there aren't any reportuhs around.
Hurry, hurry!
Whew, this is fun, huh, Akito-kun?
Yeah.
They wook wike dolls!
Let's go on it, okay, Akito-kun? Let's go on it!
Mawiko isn't scared.
However, there is one thing...
There is one thing, ma'am.
If you hadn't, I would have never met Mama... or Rei-kun...
Shut up, ex-pimp!
Shall we rebuild, then?
Stop!
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Because of various reasons, he's always lived in faraway Japan.
From now on, I plan to keep him by my side and help him become a first-class actor.
Are you talking about Hamilton's interview?
Even I've received phone calls.
But, we're already completely surrounded.
Sensei, your deadline for your script for your musical has arrived.
Sensei has been put to sleep.
No comment.
I don't care what you say...
See, I made a bridge.
Eh! You were the one who told him?
Ever since I became unable to dance, I've really hated myself.
I feel that the current me does not deserve to remain in the Hamilton house.
Is it a river?
Look, it became a bridge.
I'm really proud to have a brother like you.
Thank you, Sicil!
Sicil, she...
Naozumi.
Look.
It could be due to the uproar caused by Gary-san's interview
He can't stop.
You were pretty good.
They all opened their hearts to accept Naozumi-kun.
parte b
It's true that New York is entertaining.
You have work for us when we return?
You can predict that they'll become really famous in the future.
No?
Everybody worked hard and did a good job.
The celebration will begin in a little while.
I will try my hardest not to disappoint everyone and produce a great star.
Come, Naozumi. Hurry up and let everyone know what's in your heart.
However, to me you are just Broadway's king producer, Gary Hamilton.
Yes.
Of course we can.
Brad, why are you crying?
It hurts, stupid.
Ah, these kids...
However, because it's an anime, never mind.
Thank you for your care and support, father.
Naozumi-kun and I have perhaps become stronger than before.
but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!
blur2WABISABI kikasete DERAKKUSU
They actually passed a weird law prohibiting songs.
This stuff is not important!
It's ben a long time since I've been back!
Welcome to Sana's club.
I broke through wall, I had control of the situation...
Because of this incident, I've been reduced to despair by Kurata Sana.
Sanekichi, it's been a long time!
I haven't appeared in a long time and I'm instantly taken out.
Yo, Tomita.
A passenger ship has entered the harbor.
Ah! I'm entering a new country!
I can't.
I've just arrived here.
Everyone who sang has been photographed by this camera.
Wait a minute!
She was here!
She was chatting it up at the bar,
How can she hear such a soft sound from all the way over there?
What weird powers does she have?
You must be very disappointed, Naozumi-kun.
Yes, it's a very strange law.
There's nothing you can do if they've escaped.
Handsome Naozumi...
You and I were fated to meet.
I'll reform once I finish singing this song.
We're here to arrest anyone who dares break the song prohibition law.
Ah, we're screwed!
Give it back now!
I don't want it. I don't want a life without music.
Using Naozumi-kun was something that you came up with all by yourself.
At that time, Mayu-chan was protecting Naozumi-kun following her heart.
Okay?
Please don't play it.
I also think that the song prohibition law is very strange.
That's right. After hearing Mayu-chan's true thoughts
Everyone! The president wants to announce something.
Oh, it's so hot!
The ship has set sail, but the sound of its whistle still rings in my ears.
Like depart cutting the fingers
Love you, love you, love you, but now.
Love you, love you love you, but now.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
it's time to get out of there!
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!

Asako, be sure to have breakfast.
I received our work schedule in New York.
But that Naozumi-kun is sitting beside me right now.
Fate is a really strange thing.
Run away?
Because of this, I think I can make a lot of new friends.
Um... because this girl is your fan...
is that okay?
Eh, why not? What harm is there in one picture?
Who does he think he is?
He... with this looks, he's not just another annoying guy.
Kurata.
Is Nakaga-san's mansion here somewhere?
I never knew you were like this.
Why? Why are you crying?
If you ever feel like crying, come to me.
I'm sorry.
Sana, you're back!
Look up to me.
...l'm the only one who's single.
Not again, you're still pretending...
I don't want any past... or future...

But, we're an even better match.
He was sleeping just before the quiz, but miraculously, his mark was very high.
Yeah.

Now we are going to start Babbit's counting song.

Maybe I need to be careful not to get hit by a car...

Really? I'm so honored.
You really want that thing?
Don't worry about it. Pull yourself together, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Don't worry, it won't be published.
- I want to say thank you. - It was nothing.
I wish we can be like this forever.
But, Aya-chan, if we don't tell other people, no one will recognize us.
That's weird.

Sana-chan, look over here about the rumor that you two are dating...
I heard there are rumors saying you two are going out.
What exactly happened in New York?
We have no idea.
She didn't contact us.
They were so relaxed when they said they're going out.
Our relationship is good, that's because we're friends.
Whatever you say.
Waves are tossing in the ocean.
Bad?
Its been rescheduled to next week.
Sorry to have bothered you.
You took so long to look at bags, then ended up buying a shirt, why?
What is it?
Fuka, Papa and Mama didn't say you can't be with him,
I'm going out to cool off.
This week's Sana-chan.
Uh... this doesn't make sense.
Just a second.
She sounds strange.
staying out this late is very dangerous.
What happened?
If he has something to say to us,
This is rare, it was good thing I called you.
That hurts.
When can you remember where my home is?
Babbit is going to sing with gusto!
Yolole, Yolole, Yolole-hee.
I understand, and goodbye.
The world is not a happy piece. Who's that?
Life is good.
But they could be really going out.
I'm sorry, everyone...
Hurry back.
- Eh? I'm the boss? - Do your best.
I've been great.
Really? How was the weather?
Is he an old man?
going shopping, or going out, instead of going straight home is bad.
It's Sunday.
Look at this guy from the winner of best couple.
- He's so cute. - Which one is he?
Look over there.
What?! This is Sana's house?
Everyone, welcome.
It's Kamura Naozumi.
The legendary couple...
I knew today was Sana-chan's welcome party,
That's right.
- What's the story about? - Was it a love story?
But, I haven't seen Sana in a long time.
Well, that's who she is.
Sana-chan's story in New York is so funny.
Please enjoy.
Are you going to mention that again? I told you not to.
Aya-chan, your wording is not very nice...
That's right.

Don't you feel embarrassed about it?
Can do whatever is like this, it's not.
I think it will be better if we stop seeing each other.
There will be a ranking test soon, and I want to concentrate on it.

Saying that in front of an audience, if something goes wrong, it'd be disastrous.
Sorry, sorry, Fuka-chan.
At least you've cheered up.

Oh! This one might be good.
You seem spirited, scene six should go fairly smooth, huh?
And... Rice ball head, Idiotic Goose, Scared Cat, Cucumber Squash, Water Bottle...
You can think of the chestnut being a freebie.
Standby, ready, start!
First you draw one mountain..., then comes the water... splash...
...and there it is, Sana-chan's done!
What the heck?
I... I...
I want to say it in my mind,
I'll say it for the rest of my life.
Naozumi-kun.
Think about it!
No matter how I think about it, I still haven't a clue of what I should do!
If we don't go back to the studio...
Ah?
Hayama-kun...
You don't have anything to say, right, Hayama?
Well, Head Counselor, please make your decision.
No way, suspension?!
Wait a sec, Akito-kun!
No.
I went to see Matsui-san today.
Sorry.
I've... got a question to ask.
blur2Gutto tsukihanasu kono me ni
Because I wanna try crying with you
and for an American feeling, Texas!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
blur2watashi ha itsudemo RIRAKKUSU
It's outrageous that an actor can't say the lines in a script.
Correct.
And that brat...
What the hell are you thinking, Kurata Sana?!
You idiot!
Let's go to work!
White dolphin!
I've put it next to the radio.
Okay, thanks.
But your dad will be home late today.
Ah my coat, my coat. And my purse!
Alright.
I'm not saying...
No, I'm okay.
Grab hold.
Will you be able to pass? Well, will you be able to pass?
- Didn't I tell you to be careful? - Sorry.
How come your hair's a mess?
I think you'll have to deal with it today.
OK, I'll go to our favorite place and get you a double cheeseburger tomorrow.
Huh?
Sana-chan, your hair's so beautiful.
You must take good care of it.
Is that so?
Just a little more.
I feel as an actress being a little headstrong is alright.
Uh this...
Isn't it true that since you were little everyone's fussed over you.
It's okay, Rei-kun.
The fact that you can't say demon...
I didn't get rid of you.
You should know what he's done.
But I won't see him again.
Here I come.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You forgot your slippers.
Hayama.
What do you mean?
Why are you looking at me like that?
No way! Where? Where?
I understand!

Hayama Akito, my best friend I think...
So I don't have any work at all?
Oh well, let's just stuff it all in!
But let's ask her the truth. Maybe we should ask Sana-chan.
Sana-chan!
Hey. Is that Kurata?
Kurata is back in school!
Ah, it's ok.
Prepare 10 Zabutons!
Be quiet!
When plants get sunlight and make glucose
Photosynthesis occurs in the plant's chlorophyll.
Guess.
This is...
Fuka, are you a dog?
Long time no see! You look well!
Photosynthesis...
And you didn't even write one kanji, you can't even write it well.
I can spark English? Spark?
Today's the day Fuka-chan can take off her bandage. Oh, I just read that.
Fuka? How is it? Can you see?
It spell by many characters
Nowadays cheating is the big thing so 'don't do it'
But since the school thought it was Hayama-kun's responsibility
- He... - Sana-chan...
he didn't say one word about that...
By the way, Akito-kun... Eh? He hung up.
Is it Matsui-san?
Both of us haven't come to school for a while.
Yeah... but I'm really glad you did.
And... I'm sorry...
No... There are a lot of reasons.
I never knew that you were suspended.
Do you remember saying that to me before?
I like you because you're that kind of a person.
The truth is Hayama-kun tried to save Fuka from gangsters of another school
- Excuse us. - Fuka!
Yeah.
I don't want to see anyone right now.
Sorry that I had no power to help you...
Hayama-kun was called a 'devil',
Right now I like Naozumi-kun...
If you keep on saying that, then the matter will only get worse.
Naozumi-kun...
But I will always love you, Sana-chan.
"Wait... I want us to split up", I said
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Not really.

See? They're at it now.
Stop this! Everyone, put your desks back!
Cut it out already, would you?
In order to turn the fight to your favor,
Lizard! Centipede! Water beetle!
Sana-chan... l, um... I...
Oh, you're kidding me! You know that one, Hayama?
What's this?
I'm sorry. I won't do it any more.
And so, here is your question.
Ever since you gave up being the monkey leader,
So now you're my counselor? That's a lot of trouble you're going to.
It's no use for us to try talking about it, is it?
You're the devil!
I'll do my best in this drama!
You are such a thoroughly aggravating fellow!
This is bad, this is bad!
I see. Uh-huh, I guess not, huh?
A-chan, about your Mama...
I love you, A-chan, and that's why I tried so hard to have you.
The drama that Sana-chan acted in touched the hearts of the Hayama family.
who was playing a police officer, had?
You don't have to introduce yourself every time!
"Welcome."
Rei, it's you, isn't it!?
If you answer correctly, you will get five points!
that has fallen out of Hayama's pocket?
How are we supposed to know that!?
You called?
That was pretty harsh, going to the studio by yourself like that.
There are only a few questions left!
Do it as often as you like. It's quite enjoyable.
If you've got some kind of problem, then talk it out and settle it right now!
No! No! Rei-kun, you're my boyfriend, after all!
What is the plate number on the car that Rei-kun always drives?
Huh? What was it...? Come to think of it, I never paid attention to that...
Watch, now!
Just between you and me,
Even so, you stood by me and listened to what I had to say,
Take Sunglasses-San. It's not as though he hates you or anything, right?
Sana-chan...
...am I crying...?
Yeah, well, the mole that we keep at home is named Babbit.
Tororo! Are you watching? Daddy won!
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
I have a date with Naozumi-kun!
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
I always feel Relax,
Hayama Akito, my best friend I think...
Hayama-kun was called the devil,
Hayama was suspended.
...a 'joudan' joke right?
A 'joudan' and a 'joke' are the same thing.
Come on now, middle birthday.
Is it because you're going with Naozumi-kun to the Kamura school?
I heard it's really popular in catalog shopping.
What is this, what is this?
Am I bad or something? I don't understand!
But... I was dumped by him.
Found it.
Mom said that cake should be from the Africa Maemae Cafe in front of station.
Don't borrow it.
Ah, this kind of trash could just...
Hayama-kun, the real reason Sana-chan wasn't in the drama, do you know?
The real reason?
Ah? What's that supposed to mean?
You're really strange, Father Hayama.
You know... 'Little Love',
Watch today's drama, and you'll understand.
I think you should be more honest with your feelings.
Hmm? What, what is it, what?
So that drama...
This year I didn't do anything for her.
Thank you!
Kurata.
I have to say it, I have to tell him my feelings. I can do it now.
So that's what you get!
Don't you dare!
It's your turn, Mama.

Actually, it still needs a thing called 'motherly oven'.

Ah, can't buy 'motherly oven' now.
Never thought this would happen. Never.
Symbol of Tokyo, representing 12 million residents' hearts.
Have it broken?
Long forgotten Sana double doll is all worn out.
Looking at Naozumi-kun's idiotic face is pretty painful, isn't it?
I'm an idiot, and stupid, I'm sorry.
Wait.
- Akito-kun! - Akito, it's dangerous!
because she knew she would blow up and therefore wanted to save her own children.
Call me sister.
Shimura-san!
I had the leftover curry from the day before.
I was discussing book publishing!
We all ate different things,
Yeah, a skunk is smelly.
You stink too.
What about an elephant?
How much is the rent?
- You shut up, pig. - I'm a pig, so what?
It's because...
But... there was an old lady who knew magic.
This one.
...didn't like taking baths...
It looks like the wrinkly old lady is right.
Who is the wrinkly old lady?
That's why I put a spell on everybody.
You are a yellow-dog.
I thought if everybody else looked like me, they would want to be my friends.
Undo the spell first!
Don't push.
Don't skip any kanji words that you don't know.
Of course I have to think first. If he was human...
But he's a toilet seat.
Just a kiss, you won't lose a piece of meat.
My dear Sana-chan, I wouldn't lie to you.
I have first hand photos.
Huh? It's still a toilet seat.
In order to undo the spell, a girl with three moles,
Being a carpet, I couldn't make rice.

I can't believe my usually lazy Mama would wish for something like this.
What? Kurata-sensei still hasn't finished most of her new novel?
- Sensei! - Let's celebrate!
My wish...
Does she have a new boyfriend?
Mama, Rei-kun, and Shimura-san are all healthy, and we have the house.
 it would be really embarrassing.
Well, Sana has always been lucky in terms of work.
...is really low.
Because Sana-chan got banned by the media, all the other news got mashed together.
I got annoyed so I came back earlier.
I have my troubles too.
You will come with me to London, right?
Can you help me down?
So now I can use this chance to study more.
Just like sauce covering rice.
It's a record mail!
New year day is over when you wake up.
Apart from the message there are sounds like Ka-kong and dogs barking.
This is not a samurai film!
Did you send this record mail?
Anyone would be surprised.
This is a small place, but please come in.
Don't be so shameless.
This is the video of the first episode of Kodocha.
Of course, we taped every single episode of Kodocha.
this really is troublesome.
Of course, those are all only rumors.
Rei-kun!
Sana-chan.
I've been thinking about it since.
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't write the script for the last scene.
Never making that line coherent with the rest of the story.
The main point is, you remembered me.
And you changed your opinion about me.
Really? Is that so?
Only a video?!
I want to give this job a try.

I understand, I'll try my best.
It's 4, it's easy easy!
Sana-chan, I heard that you were bad at math but I didn't know you couldn't even read it.
My new job started! If you would like you can come and see it!
Sana-chan!
Ok, Sana-chan. Let's do the easiest problem, Q1.
Cut, cut!
The set is small, and we don't have money so be careful.
But when it comes to factors of 6 and 7 and 8... well...
Oh, I don't get it, it's all gibberish.
I'm like that too, and I can't understand, so do the others...
seems like you're having a problem with it.
No, it's not a little.
Mizoguchi-sensei said that...
It's dull and...
Sana-chan, then do you wanna quit this job?
So if we go to London with Asako, I'll be with Sana-chan.
It's different.
You always try to do everything by yourself
but that's wrong.
Yeah, that's right, Mama.
Ah, ok.
So there is another person, but I wonder if she will do it.
I'll have to make you understand these pages, right?
I'm gonna say this in advance, but I'm a strict teacher.
You can't do multiplication?!
Sensei, can I actually improve?
Math is a subject that you have to build one block at a time.
You can catch up to everyone.
That means we must use math to drive a hard bargain in everyday life.
Don't eat snacks!
What are you talking about, we're best friends.
But come to think of it, we're sitting here together eating snacks.
I'm sorry, Fuka.
I found it's the first time to eat as we walking like this.
But our personalities are really different.
See, it's the same.
So I think the video will come out well if we answer that question.
Mizoguchi-san took most of Fuka's and my ideas.
So you guys aren't afraid of math anymore, right?
And everything will be alright, so math is life.
Good work.
but if the reviews are not good...
And Sana-chan got infected too.
I wanted to do this job.

This time, the guy actually likes the housewife type.
So that's why she was making it.
She always gets dumped in the end.

Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
"Zenjiro-san!"
--Whut just happened? --Whut just happened?
I ask you to please leave Sana-chan alone.
Nope. As far as parents and family goes,
Sorry about this. It's going to be a little bit bumpy.
Everyone, Sana-chan is coming! Hurry, hurry!
I shouldn't remember this place at all,
For some reason, I'm so excited...
This is the director, Kamura-sensei. She is everyone's mother.
I understand that you took care of me for a month.
--and this... and this!
I'm Yui!
--Shake our hands!
Nao-chan, that girl is going to laugh at you if all you do is cry.
We're having a fancy barbecue, too!
No... I wouldn't say that...
--Sana-chan, sing!
A- annoying...?
That car...!
Okay, come quick! Hurry, come quick! Come right away!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Get here in three seconds! Got that!? You have to!
Whoever's voice is the loudest loses this contest!
Hasn't she forgotten about something?
Earlier, she forgot that we even existed.
Yeah. She's an idiot.
Hey! Hold it!
--It's sparkling, see? --than she is Naozumi-kun, huh?
When are you going to get off my back, Auntie!?
But I won't have any violence. This is supposed to be an anime
and it turns out she's playing around something royal.
He wanted to greet Sana-chan in a different way from everyone else.
 --You don't behave yourself, either.  --Stop.
 --Big Brother Nao is falling apart. 
--I'm glad I skipped work for this. --Let go, I said.
he's there.
...for two.
No matter what happens, I'm retiring!
from anyone's viewpoint.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,

blur2BIKKARI! KIKKARI! saeteru ATAMA PII! PII!
I know! I laughed so hard at Sana-chan in yesterday's 'Kodocha'. Dunn.
You, you're more awkward than before.
Over there, are you listening to the lesson, Hayama?
Don't play innocent!
Is there a school rule that bans us from learning karate?
Really, it's the kind of thing that you would think about, Hayama.
I would like to believe Hayama's words.
My face was like that?
but get pissed off when they see Kurata Sana.
- I hate Kurata Sana... - Yeah, you get that kind of a mail...
Sana really knows how to handle Akito.
Sana is like mail, she can go in and out of Akito's tangled mind.
That's impossible, Akito-kun.
No! If you get hurt in karate, it will be horrible,
Will you...
Are you really making a Karate club?
...the end of the century will be ruled by karate...
Isn't that life's Ukelele.
Yay, thank you, Ishida-kun!
Sana-chan is happy. Sana-chan's happiness is my happiness.
Oh, I'm so happy. Come and sign here.
Hey you, won't you join the Karate club? Hey, you don't have to run away!
Where? Where?
Isn't that great, Hayama?
Lake BLWA is made of many dislocations of cave-ins.
Wait, this doesn't have to do with anything.
- Sensei! - I'm alright!
One more person...
That's not light.
Going out... is this?
The karate club doesn't have enough people in it?
Those people, if we put on a sweet face, they will run wild.
If you don't care and make little wrong now,
Not just for Hayama, but for myself too.
Yeah, sounds good!
- Um, I... I can't... - You can't?
So mom named this for me!
Ramen, ramen!
blur2anata to naite mitai kara
Just now, when I turned away from your kiss

blur2watashi ha URUTORA RIRAKKUSU
blur2WABISABI kikasete DERAKKUSU
...and add more friends and win the district competitions and the Olympics!
We're gonna be late.
Shouta, I called the school, ok?
My record of not being late and perfect attendance...
- Brother, dinner. - What's today's dinner?
Order something for today.
What? You're in my class?
It's not Yamano Anata!
Yamano Anatano Soratoku.
One more push, Hayama! We'll have enough members.
He kinda looked too scared to say it, so I asked him to.
Compared to some weak manager who was looking for a girl,
- Don't glare at me like that. - Who's glaring at you?
Well, well, stop it.
It if turns out like this, I think I'll do something like be a bunny girl!
Sana-chan, are you really gonna be a bunny girl?
Thanks, Kurata.
Of course I got the eraser at last!
Don't put on a gloomy face like that!
Mom, can we order ramen?
I'm excited because I've got lots of good ideas,
His health is not so strong. So he made up a goal that he would never be absent.
From which day on?
He was absent because he felt exhausted for an after school activity.
- An after school activity? - Yeah. He started Karate or something.
This karate club is something that Hayama made.
Damnit, again in a bad situation.
Class 1 Nakao-kun is missing...
For it's dangerous for Hayama-kun to make Karate club...
and this club was made by Hayama! That's reason enough.
Nakao!
When Hayama-kun asked me to join the Karate Club
I bet something happened. Hayama made no explanation and the atmosphere is bad.
Hey hey, what does it say? Hey, read it!
How did you feel about him?
What he means is he was girlish as in cute and anybody will like him.
Not what type he is,
Can't you even apologize?!
Hayama-kun, I don't care how little it is,
blur2tooranakya ikenai michi wo
blur2Love Me Deeper daite kizutsuketai
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
Will someone be worried about me if I'm gone?
I was asked to join the karate club by Hayama-kun.
I'm thinking about my work too...
- Student's parents... - You hid it, didn't you?! Let's see it!
The rumor spread quickly
I heard that kid Nakao ran away because of Hayama's torturous training.
Ah... my mother is diagnosed with an incurable disease, so I have to nurse...
Yeah, he was more concerned about his conduct grade.
It's almost time to get my new karate belt.
I'm sure Nakao is fine
Your idol girlfriend doesn't know how to talk to adults.
It's no use, it's stuck!
Are you alright?
It will slip out like this...
What is it?
It's in my bag.
I read your letter.
So what do you say...
Did Sensei read it too?
- Eh, we're starting class? - Yes, we are.
I don't want to leave.
I'm a useless human...
Now, Nakao-kun, get yourself together. Hey, come on now.
What? Hayama is great? That's a misunderstanding.
I'm not crying, idiot!
I am the revolutionary girl of uncoolness.
- Hey, the police must have news. - Dear...
We won't say that so... please come back!
Kurata-san also?
Yes, those two were slinky. What did they do?
Because of that, he wants Nakao-kun shut up with violence, I bet he's doing it.
The two still left their bags here.
Endurance? Come to think of it, this north wing of the old school building.
Well, if we can't pull the head out, let's counter pull him
if the head comes out, the body will come out too.
I...
I can't.
Sana-chan disappeared, what is all this about?!
Rather than walking around in circles
Love me deeper, hold me, be reborn
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
it's time to get out of there!
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
I may be a little jumbled,
I always feel Relax,
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!
blur2AMERICA kibun de TEXAS
blur2tettai shichau yo
blur2watashi ha URUTORA RIRAKKUSU
Oh, that's right!
Akito...
You don't need to worry about Nakao.
It's not your fault, Sensei.
Did I use the wrong way to well this to you?
You don't have to worry about Nakao-kun.
No.
...had no one to tell him that.
But I'll hold myself back because father is an adult.
Sagami-kun, go tell those two the news.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
The teachers will come back soon.
That's why you wrote the letter to Sengoku-sensei?
Inside my dream, I died and thought: "Oh, I died".
Fuka-chan, can you come?
- Huh?! - Got it?! You guys wait!
- Ahh! Akito! Are you alright? - Ooh, Natsumi.
The society that adults have just created carelessly
We can't choose adults.
Sensei, maybe you do not remember that there was no eraser on the chalkboard.
- Hayama... - Yeah?
Just now, when I turned away from your kiss
Rather than walking around in circles
Love me deeper, hold me, I wanna hurt you
You can't ignore it either.
please don't be embarrassed.
At sunset,
let's burn the fire of love.
Alright!
I wonder why I oversleep every morning.
I don't care if you're tardy or not,
and looked at the clock and it was already 8:30
...And that's my Mama.
Rei-kun's careful driving
Sana-chan, the safety is really the most important
It is my duty
I trust with you
You see,
Boy, you look like you ate some rotten fruit,
What's that?
They've been going steady for a LONG time!
Ever since 6th grade started,
Maybe not.
Sana-chan, your manager sure is cute.
I'm gonna beat him like a...
Thanks, Mamo-chan!
Nope.
You got it.
But it's SPRING!
Are you listening to me, Zenjirou-sensei?
They make a big mess and it's all HIS fault!
It is him, of course
then you have to
Rei-kun! Rei-kun! Rei-Kun!
It was too late, Sana was a sister of the forest
Mmm... Well done.
Sana-chan...
In case of an emergency,
this machine will vibrate.
Oh, so this is a like a hot line between the two of us?
Eh, what the...
How simple they are!
What was that??
tiger, boar and fox!
What??
Because of all the fuss, Sana runs away to Hawaii with Rei-kun!
What is he thinking?
to put ink in them instead of water!
I can't bear it any more
I'm gonna...
my love confession is on schedule
He was there...
At sunset,
You can tell it accurately.
Please, our relationship...
let's burn the fire of love.
Don't be so easy going
Good luck
Our Classroom is Primate Paradise
Akito-kun,
I thought you were going to beat her up.
Hayama-san, let's beat the crud out of them!
Let's do it, Hayama-san.
You guys wash your hands!
so if I can just get to the gate,
my croquet club technique! I mastered it at Komawari!
You remember her saying...
I guess so.
I almost forgot.
Help m... - !
Something about me being a demon-child...
What are you doing? Are you alright, Mami-chan?
What? Are you OK?
And this is the first time I've hit somebody.
This calls for counseling.
If you're not that stupid,
Sana-chan.
Come on
I heard you're going to be starring in a made-for-TV movie!
Incredible power!
Sensei!
Weak spot?
Singing Sana-chan
Attack the weak spot! Be sneaky and unfair!
Kick his butt, Sana-chan! Sure it's unfair, but what can you do?
Justice it is, and these chances are few!
C'mon, what is it? Hm? Hm?
But, um, well... um...
get even with Hayama?
Get her.
I told them
OPEN OPEN
I have ajob!
the great rock climbing festival!
Hey, sweat pants!
Oh, they belong to Miho-chan.
A tornado?
Serves her right after all the things she did to Hayama-san.
I'm getting cold!
Opps! Silly me!
Mom, can I go in the room
but what is it exactly that you mean by Junk?
In that ordinary classroom!
Today's incident is burning love!
Huh... easy going
And this guy is of my class,
What a devil!
Now I can WIN him!
What is it, Sana-chan?
Come back please, lovely boy!
Do you know that?
It's dangerous!
OK! Leave it to me, I've won already!
Really cocky, isn't she?
I'm very happy!
Yes yes, thank you, thank you.
It's high! It's high!
That must be the reason...
Look at him! Isn't he cuuute??
Shut up.
Uncle uncle uncle.
Don't be so angry or you'll be a mosquito!
You! Quit it!
Does it taste good?
Why don't you make them stop!
If you're a teacher...
Really?
Then Hayama found out.
Hayama?
He now has us by our weak spot...
...because we can't have the principal knowing about this.
Making out?! What?
...I think things will be a bit different.
I want to ask him to give me the picture aboveboard!
But before that, tell me more about the picture.
If you reject me...
Tsuyoshi-kun? Is he the boy with glasses?
Sana-chan, do you go by the look of things?
his embarrassing moment!
You make me sick!
You never should've been born in the first place!
Never, never come back, you little devil!
Is she his real sister?
Hey, what should we do? He's getting away, Sana-chan.
Don't push me, Sana-chan.
Well, this is nothing!
I'll plaster the town with this!
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
He was there...
In that ordinary classroom!
Living is a fault!
A mysterious white bat!
But now I have Hayama's nude picture!
Is this all?
That's all I have.
Yes.
All right.
It's those stupid idiot...
I just played with them!
But you are against them...
You know how many problems...
C'mon, c'mon...
You'd better apologize better, or you know what's coming...
Can you believe that?! I can't believe it!
Now are you satisfied?
Everything's all right, I hope...
Are you saying you have scales in your nose?
...I oversleep again!
Stop them, you ex-boss monkey!
but he's being beaten up!!
Get out of my way, idiot!
Hayama-san!
He promised me to meet me here, but I can't find him.
He might be quiet now...
Sana-chan is very worried about Hayama.
The suspect has entered his room.
You think you could get me Zenjirou's autograph?
But you, I won't cook anything for you!
Don't forget that autograph!
a loving mom, Rei-kun. There's lots of other people I love...
I never know that there's really a person like that.
You're the ideal daughter.
That's how it is.
Just kidding. It's ready.
Nothing like a little exercise after dinner!
cold and sad...
She works at a supermarket near the station...
What's wrong with...
He's right... there's nothing wrong with loving your mother.
when my friend suddenly invited me.
Huh... easy going
Rei Sagami.
DON'T BE DISSIN' MY MOM!!!!!!
You are not such a bad guy after all.
See ya, Sana-chan!
Good morning teacher!
Thank you, God.
I'll bet he understands us.
Yes! This is called honest!
Are you happy?
No thanks.
so don't worry.
We need one more to play football, would you like to join us?
You should have listened to me from the beginning.
Hey, you!
Can you count him in for me?
Wait... I've got to keep trying my own way.
Go enjoy yourself and mind your own business!
That's right.
What's with the apron?
Looks nutritious...
But I made a little mistake, so why don't we start from page 46 today?
Is yourjob tiring you?
Sana-chan...
What?
1... 2... 3... 4...
You think you're always right, don't you?
but he rejected me.
Can't you skip work forjust a half a day?
Sana-chan, I've heard you're starring in a made-for-TV movie.
I'm the mother and the sickness is the sister and the main character, and...
Wait! But everybody else is real actors...
for your sister, see?
It's your fault! Akito, it's all your fault!
Um... this is for you.
You...
Don't mention it.
I'm waiting...
Sana-chan.
He was there...
So the boy look back at me!
Really, I miss you all day and all night!
Today's incident is burning love!
7 O'clock News!
You're asking for something not there.
Rei Sagami.
And Akito Hayama, who recently retired to become a Ionely wolf.
He said...
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Huh?
Mama, you sound so serious!
Supopotamin for all you kids out there!
I can't stand his family.
I promised to the sunset
I'm gonna do something about Hayama's family!
Sorry I couldn't make it to the story meeting.
Good luck, Sana-chan. I envy your having such a nice role.
Are you listening to me?
He should've told me or something.
Why do you always think like that?
Hey, sis! Are ya busy?
What?
No, I...
Sis, I... Sis, happy birthday!
with a sister and a father and a brother.
Wait!
Uh, you are Akito's...
next Friday at 8 PM.
Color...
As they were talking...
I guess he's asleep.
so you do too!
Oh, except for my Croquet technique...
make them have a happy ending too!
I hope it will work.
Especially if they watch it together.
All three of you watch, and you will see
How it'll work... It's guaranteed by me!
What's up with you?
Uh... he just left for dinner.
and did such bad things in school...
Where are you, Hayama!?
Is this all you're eating? How can that fill you?
That reminds me!
...and even called him a devil.
You put too much pressure on yourself.
Someone should come to look after you.
Mr. Hayama!
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?
I waited for his reply
He was there...
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
it's time to get out of there!
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
but then, I have a one-in-two chance of losing, too.
This is the last one.
an8"Sana!" "Rei-kun"
Come on, come on.
Sagami-kun, you really are...
Bye, now, Rei-kun. No commercials for me...
I think that the strength and sharpness of your chop are suited toward karate.
You're not going to watch any more?
Not really.
...want to... learn...
...if you're going to pursue this, now's the best time.
This is Narunaru.
Sana-chan, want to go, too?
this is the perfect chance to line up some good jobs, and make your big break!
Yes?
Give her a little time off.
I pushed her into making that promise with me,
there's no reason to force her to continue working.
Okay.
We invited Sana-chan to come, too, so I think she'll be here later.
I heard that Japanese girls are good at karate,
Isn't that what you want to say, Tsuyoshi-kun?
It would just be too much trouble to butt in, so let's keep quiet.
This will be a treat!
I could have played more with Aya-chan and the others. That's right!
--I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! --Why are you saying such a childish thing?
Mm-hmm...
I will speak about what's going on to the producers of "Child's Toy."
make up for what she had to put up with, as much as she likes.
I am in her debt for rescuing me when I was homeless.
Ah, they're so warm!
Rei-kun!
and is even quitting "Child's Toy."
Is that right? Be careful.
Nature! Freedom!
Yo, Hayama! Are you pretending to be in training, or something?
What do you think?
He wanted to do something...?
He wanted something to do...?
Sana-chan, have you retired from the entertainment world?
Well, if everyone says so...
to always go along with the scenario.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
That rumor that I love you
Akito Hayama!
It hurts even when you're only acting, H
Sana-chan, your drama was good.
And my favorite actress Asako Kurumi-san.
But this story looks like it's going to be about them!
I am back
Very tired, I am tired out
Of course, heh heh heh.
but I think it's gonna get better than before.
Where's Rei-kun?
now on, eat dinner at home.
And his father put him on his shoulder
allowance! In a good mood so I'm gonna be generous!
That's right!
I wonder if you have a fever, a cold...?
Wow, a face-to-face talk with Asako Kurumi?
Yep, she requested it!
It is impossible to change a devil into a angel in a short time
It'll get better, bit by bit.
Yeah, I guess.
Pal, she says.
No, no it can't be...
But you can't.
Let's go to bed early,
tomorrow is the talk with Kurumi-san!!!
Swallow it!
I don't think I can drive the car.
No time for that,
Possessed by an evil spirit?!
If isn't so
No you haven't.
Um, because...
Aaahhhh, it's already that time!!
If I don't take it soon
Oh that's no big deal!
You know, your mother's novels are amazing!
you know...
you say some grown-up things even though you're still a child.
Some say that he's your live-in boyfriend...
It is that
A woman's instinct!!
Now what do you mean by a hermit...
No waysie!!
Sana-chan, you were very cute!
Okay, thank you very much!
When the time comes, try to stay calm.
If there's no cars then cross!
The cliche...
but today I digress.
I'll tell you my heart!
So the boy look back at me!
...of your other love?
Why??
It's been a long time.
You've been avoiding me haven't you?
Take off those sunglasses!
Show me your face!
Don't lay your hands on Rei-Kun!
And Sana-chan! Sana-chan too!
Asako-chan, come on!
Rei, I want to really talk to you!
I thought something was wrong.
When we were filming the drama before...
Why did you keep it a secret?
Don't worry about anything.
Yes.
What, about Rei-kun?
What are you doing farting in the morning, Hayama?
That's your boyfriend?
I..., I wouldn't listen to you
Poor Sagami-kun, ha ha ha ha.
At least take off you sunglasses when you're talking to someone.
How rude.
Rei-kun, everything's been great until now.
Mama, see, today, the teacher really complimented me.
I brought home that person Mama said before was named homeless!
Rei-kun!
I was hired
I really didn't get it...
You're not really in love.
No that's not right!
Come on, hey! What's wrong? You're not like the usual Akito-kun!
What?
I thought you didn't hear.
There's others. Rascal. Rubbersole. Russel.
Late!! I'm so sorry!
Don't you take a lift by your boyfriend as usual?
Uh, Sana-chan!
Okay.
Tomorrow, I don't have to work.
I'll go home with my friends.
You added wrong!!
A visit to the Shinjuku City Hall Observatory,
when a burp isn't coming out!
Not good Tsuyoshi-kun.
you have to laugh.
Hey, you can see the school!
Everyone's so small!
Don't tell such a confusing story!
I gonna do?
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
In great distress...
He was there...
Is it a sin if I sneak into you heart
Don't be so easy going
Anyway you've got a twenty years old boyfriend.
It doesn't make any difference to you.
So she hasn't kissed yet.
I think it may just be my nerves,
Messed up.
Sorry. Goodbye.
Sensei!!
Mother, I am sorry.
Things like this just can't happen!!
The food I want most now...
Oh, where is it?
How can a creep like that have
It's done!!!
This here... this here is... THIS IS TO BATTLE HAYAMA!
I CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM!
If you're really her boyfriend, take care of her.
Everyone felt sorry for Sana!
So that's what happened. Thank you very much.
Hayama.
Oh. It's the pimp.
Get in!
Have you ever thought of how she feels? Hmm?
so he won't defecate in his quarters.
He's still like a kid that way, I guess.
Her anger's instantaneous.
Of course!
If they can't see your face, the fans will be sad.
Well, if I'm good enough, I'll be your support!
I'm sorry, Rei.
Something really happen between you and Asako?
That's not how I saw it.
I can't say yet, not even to you.
Is it morning already?
Right. After I met you, I flunked out of college...
When I woke up, I was among the garbages.
If you were serious,
You live in the past. I mean, how was I supposed to
I became an actress!
when will it be okay?
Asako came to see you?!!
is panic
My friend call upon me suddenly
You can't ignore it either.
when the children go home,
You can tell it accurately.
Please, our relationship...
In a city without light,
To survive is a mistake.
Rei!
Of course I did.
Hey, they ran away while I was talking...
You don't know! I don't know!
Is Sana-chan here?
I'm in 2nd grade!
Doh, really?!
Oh, it's Akito!
That's not gonna turn into a chick...
Put some more thought into it, idiot.
He'll be the laugh stock if he tell others when he grows up.
There's something that Mama told me once!
Reality, Sana...
what did you want to see me about?
Where, where?
Calligraphy Special!
You didn't have anything to do with Asako-san,
I mean, you and I are lovers!
I thought you would realize it on your own,
PIMP?
I'm kinda... kinda...
If you hadn't been seeing
Yes. Yeah, that's probably so.
Jeez...
Oh, how embarrassing.
Anyway, you're pretty well-liked, so this little bit of
It's controlled by remote-controller.
If it's not for you,
Darnit... I'M SAYING THANK YOU!!!
Hey. What.
Geez.
But he was listening to me very seriously just now.
The guy has some good points.
Mama said this wasn't a real love...
Though suffer a lot
I've been practice for long
yes it is.
of your other love?
but you and Sagami-kun are not in love.
from natto, oh, I don't like it, bald plum.
up-and-coming talent of this central region.
as the best manager in Japan, would...
Oh, but, until the future, in order for you to become
You don't have Kodocha or Komawari today, right?
it right away and then let's
A crane, 1000 years, a turtle 10000 years! Our regards!
Okay!
No good.
Sana-chan generously gave you
Ok!
Yay! It's Ok!
He was eating even before they started shooting, wasn't he?
Babbit got leftover ice cream!
Yeah. 4 more.
Rei-kun, the road to great manager-dom is a long one.
Who are you calling Ma'am?
and became an adult.
Sana-chan
Work has been stressful.
And when I asked, do you like sushi?
Father, you're becoming more father like.
Hello, Kurata residence.
Hurry up.
His voice sounded pretty steady.
So I guess... go!
Get a grip. You're usually so cheerful it's annoying.
Don't worry about him.
He works a little bit too hard.
Hayama,
I'll give you this.
Sorry to trouble you.
Haha, that's you trying to say thank you.
I left him at Asako-san's place.
And phone calls come for her, don't they, Sensei?
into good men, you let them become your lovers.
That's not the kind of thing you should teach.
Very well. The meal in the hospital is very delicious.
Hayama is truly worried about his father.
I want to express to you as the play
Though I've made up my mind, my mind
please don't be embarrassed.
This Time, Sana is the Lonely Wolf!
No, that's bempi constipation!
I wonder if there's anyone who knows the meaning of dappi.
Good.
Please Sensei... you're...
I'm a 6th grade child actress.
Okay, okay! Everybody shut up!
Like this!
shed a skin or two to grow as an actress.
It's good! Hatchimitsumikanpai!
I added 3 more.
Again?! Oh, well, it's metamorphosis!
Rush out. Hello.
Can I go afterwards?
Where is he from?
Alright, I'll think of something good to give.
Sana-chan, what do you like?
It's a secret!
Okay, from the middle! Alright, let's try it!
It's not quite right.
Hanging around you gets annoying.
Okay!
Ohh, Oh, no! Oh, no!
Hisae-chan's mother was like,
She was really looking forward to it.
Sana became a Lonely Wolf
Just a Little While longer...
To take meaning as Daughter of the Rising Sun,
Japan's number one energetic girl.
Sana-chan! I'll protect you with my life! Sana-chan!
Chan-chan, all messed up, So Re Ro Ko Rin
Chocolate, hazy candy, parent-child-bug
Voice warm up done!
Okay, next. Ready, start!
Over? Really?
I have to make up with everyone.
But all you do is show up and then disappear again.
Don't be doing ridiculous things.
Let me see.
Hayama-san!
I'm feeling ORNERY!! Gyao!
And Tsuyoshi-kun is being ultra violent!
Everyone, to the staff room!
Thanks.
You're right.
Forgive me
Hey. Which do you think is best?
No, in fact I like both.
You did that much work?
It's painful.
Tsuyoshi...!
You can't ignore it either.
Is it a sin if I sneak into you heart
You can tell it accurately.
Sensei, did Tsuyoshi-kun call?
Hayama! What's the matter?
Tell me so I know!
Well I mean, we got divorced.
Bald asshole! Bald asshole! Bald asshole...
When did you get that?
Bald asshole! Bald asshole...
What do dads do? You idiot!
We don't have time to be fighting.
Your forehead is bleeding.
From earlier...
then that's horrible.
But when we left just now,
No.
It was right in front of my face.
So that's what's been going on...
O... of course! We'll help you clean!
sometimes gentle,
Oh my, thank you so much.
Brother, where is daddy?
When's he coming?
Slimy ones, rich-tasting ones...
You're scaring me!
What?
You've all been a great help.
I thought it'd take us a week to settle it.
Oh this was no big deal.
Really, thank you very much.
No it's okay Tsuyoshi-kun,
If I can be any help, please let me know.
Don't take advantage of the situation!!!
Ouch... It was ajoke.
What, Aya-chan?
You and Tsuyoshi-kun are friends?
Cheer up, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Aya-chan's a really concerned, worrisome person!
Hey, good for you, Tsuyoshi!
Now you can be even closer to your mommy!
Oh mommy, give me a hug!
That's so rare that
Sugita has an outburst like that.
Ohhhh Aya-chan,
You mean Water in a sleeping ear
Sorry I'm going to go home now okay?
Would you work out an idea?
Yes
I have nothing to do with her.
1,2,3!
Nope.
I could never trust men because of them!
so it almost finished.
Oh, I'm all right.
Where's your father?
The absolute live
I want to express to you as the play
My friend call upon me suddenly
You can't ignore it either.
when the children go home,
Today's incident is burning love!
let's burn the fire of love.
I'm ajealous sixth-grader and Elementary School actress!
Ha ha ha that's all there is to it.
Nope, that's not it.
Bye.
We can only buy up to 500 yen worth of snacks.
until I have 500 yen worth!
Bye.
With this conch shell.
The two conditions before I could start
just a little bit more known than normal kids.
Really?
Ohhh he's here!
We're off!
What did you bring for snacks?
Would that be considered a snack?
Carrying everyone's idol and hope,
Huh? Yeah, come on it's meat, it's meat!!!
Mom's probably working away right now.
You went to the bathroom?
W... what are you glaring at me for?
Wanna start something?
Did something happen?
You're sharp, Hayama!
Oh okay.
They're caught!!
You don't dislike it.
We'll have to punish...
Hmm?
There's no reason for elementary children
Look at him.
I wish mom could see it.
Sana-chan had gone off on a class trip,
It'll be okay, it'll be all right...
What do you think this holy area of education is??
Are you joking??
A cliff!
Yes.
I'M GOING TO BE VIOLATED!!!!
Don't get any closer!
What do you mean by saying do something nasty?
Last night...
Um, I'm a little worried right now.
I was arrogant before
Please don't blame it on the true kiss
You're asking for something not there.
Famous novelist.
Oh she's making fun of me.
When summer break's over.
So you must live for the both of us, Ah-chan.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, Honda-san
Even now in case of
I'm not going to be able to protect Sana-chan like this.
If you disturb me I'll whap you in the forehead!
Sana-chan...
That...
Hayama's family discussion
Ice cream, ice cream...
As we know Sana is really a good girl.
And Natsumi's eventually
Heh. Why are you laughing?
how can I put it?
Thanks.
Hey do it again!
You're running away now
I was so happy
Woops, I guess it was becoming really serious.
Sana, we were really worried about you.
Y... yeah.
But I'm still really busy!
in which I play the heroine!
There's singing,
And August!!
ahhh, scrubbed too much, yeah right!
The commercials!
Did you hear Akito-kun?
He's a pretty boy!
Maybe he's like in shoujo manga...
Hey...
you think of summer festivals right?
Akito-kun, you're the first person I'm talking about this to.
It's in magazines?
I can't wait!
My mom... she is writing an essay.
The Actual Commercial Filming
Yeah, you look great.
You couldn't dance very well at the ballet recital.
Here you go.
Thank you!!
Wow, it's so pretty!
But today it's different
I want to be frank to you
You can't ignore it either.
of your other love?
Please, our relationship...
let's burn the fire of love.
I'm Kurata Sana!
Sana-chan!
someone who only likes them a little bit!
Hey what what that's not it?
Oh?
Get money?
Isn't it coming up this year?
Naozumi! Where are you?
Hmmm, well I'm not gonna know by thinking.
Sagami-san, is Sensei inside?
Before publication...
I don't think anything now.
Delete. Reset. OK
Sana, what are you doing?
Honda-san from editing!!!
You know it now?
Honda Takezo-san!
That means
if you can wait and see the secret about Sana.
there may be a huge sensation, but...
Who knows?
Shit! Troublesome!
Wow why?
at a place like this, I don't know...
Zenjiro, the one that's on TV a lot! Hey!
It's Kamura.
We're the best friends of Sana-chan.
Yep, just like that.
She is making friends with Hayama lately.
Oh I'm nervous,
a nervous summer, a Japanese summer!
When Rei-kun pretended to be sick,
Ahhh, yeah it really chilled me out.
Has everyone eased their tensions??
This Yucy is Sana-chan right?
Before my entrance, I'm nervous again!
I'm Zenjiro, the one on TV, Zenjiro.
Sana-chan let's fight!
Yucy-sama, it's Tom, it's Tom!
He's dead, he was killed by the troops!
fight even if it's hard and miserable.
A smile can become strength.
Come on, won't you try it, hmm?
He isn't perseverant
Really? You want to learn?
The absolute live
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
"Clear, With Occasional Gone Missing"
--Yahoo! I nailed it! I won! --You've stopped making sense.
Yes, this has been a taping
I knew it!
This is an anime, so it's okay and awl, but this would be pretty hawsh!
At the time, you promised never to see them again, right?
Sana...
"The next day, 'Child's Toy' was on location, too"
Back up, back up!
These morning location shoots are really tough.
--Peace! Peace! Kisses! Kisses! --She's a born cutup.
Right, I know.
Mm-hmm! It's really her!
Say, is Zenjiro going to be there, too?
You got beat up again, huh? Zenjiro-chan, you're pretty lousy.
I get the feeling that nuttin' is going right today.
Mawiko was hungwy.
Any idea where...?
Sana-chan!
make sure to fasten your seatbelts. Promise me!
They said she was talking about wanting to see Sana-chan.
We have to look for her!
"Rei-kun's route" means Rei-kun's old friends, the homeless network.
"Mariko-chan's whereabouts unknown. Please look for her."
Ah, it's your Burutcha. Is Sana-chan trying to contact you? A code?
Deciphering the code is going to be hard.
I'm going to call them and have them reimboise me for this!
I ordered away for this remote controlled lost child search balloon
If you have too much rice, add more tea while you're eating.
You can make it quicker than you'd might expect.
You get just a hint of the sour plums mixed in with the tea and rice flavors.
Sana-chan...
My husband, Mariko's father.
she's been saying she was going to see Sana-chan,
Let's have some fun together again.
I'm the one to blame.
No, it's me!
I knew it.
Let's look for her! Mariko-chan must be inside the station!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Mariko... Mariko is my-- and Keiko-san's-- cherished daughter.
Huh? Zenjiro-san, what's with the outfit?
I wonduh if the rental is here...
I know not of her.
Right. Dear, please come back!
Why?
What!?
You're alive and well, so you have to be happy!
Right...
What's this, some kind of trouble?
Mama...
You're going to sing?
Hayama, won't you dance with us?
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
The sun is falling...
In a city without light...
Mother's Book of Surprises
Save me, Sana-chan.
Sana-chan, you're so popular.
You're amazing!
Tsuyoshi-kun, your nose is bleeding.
Tissue!
Sana-chan, you sure are pretty.
Just one shot.
C'mon in, puh-leeze!
Don't be so stuck-up, stupid.
It was wonderful, Kurata-sensei!!
I had a meeting with the editor, Mr. Onda...
Yes.
Don't worry!
That was enjoyable...
Mama... Mama's essay comes out tomorrow.
Meanwhile...
You look so pretty...
What is he after now?
Please don't say stuff like that.
Hey, Sana-chan, lend me some money! You've gotta have loads.
This isn't working right.
Remind me never to piss those two off.
Her essay describes in detail...
If you want to criticise, do so after reading the book.
This is what we promised.
Why do you do this to me?
I haven't done anything.
We want to know...
Did you know about the action the mother took?
in Child's Toy about Kurata Sana.
Of course, everybody on the street stared at me.
It was Sana.
...and then sent to a children's home.
Okay.
Yes, Mama.
What you wrote in your essay, is it true?
I see.
I said I understood her feelings.
We're... kind a... fighting right now.
Hayama-kun, I leave her with you today.
I had everything planned out...
I've been acting like ajerk lately...
Please don't be embarrassed.
is it the bad thing?
I can't understand him!
You better get me a cold drink or something!!
Yes, please.
The only thing she's worried about is what her mom's thinking.
and people knowing about it...
Really, my body is still a kid.
Oh, that's no big deal.
Way to go, Mr. Hayama.
You don't have many of Akito.
Only Mama knows about them!! Don't tell the others!
It's time for good children to go to bed.
What can we do?
Disguise! Disguise! Dis-dis-guise!
What's going on?!
It is just a human weight doll.
I can't take this! My neighbors will lynch me!
Oooops!
What do you want to do with the natto?
But enough about me...
That said, I'm headed off...
Need more sleep...
All done!
Seriously?
Mama says that there's no more than a five percent chance of finding her.
I was driven to despair by his words.
what I would do if Mama wants...
Then I'll speak to her!
becoming more and more heated...
when Kamura's manager intervened.
Once in a while we get news of a child abandonment.
I'm going to school now.
you went and did that!
I can't do anything now.
Don't you feel that weird?
my love confession is on schedule
but today I digress.
In that ordinary classroom!
Really, I miss you all day and all night!
and starting to miss you...
Today's incident is burning love!
You're asking for something not there.
You look like her.
I love Mama.
Sakai Keiko-san...
Yes.
Now it's up to Sana.
Sensei, I have brought Sana-chan here, though...
And now you don't even make sense!
Yay! Sweet chestnuts! Sweet chestnuts!
Shut up!
Keiko-san, what sort of person is my father?
My mother had a boyfriend...
I couldn't tell him...
I was so confused that...
I didn't know what had happened.
Well, there is one thing I always wanted to ask you.
I always thought it was the 7th of March
So what?
That's right, Samu.
Right, I remembered that I wanted to take a photo.
What is she doing?
I wonder if this is OK.
My daughter is nearly three years old.
Hayama, did you hear? I have a little sister.
on Sunday at Ribbon Land.
Uh, well, yeah. Can Tsuyoshi join us?
. Do not wake me up.
I'm not Zenjiro. Oh, my back hurts. It hurts so much.
There are no magazine reporters here.
Both of you are walking funny.
Gosh, too bad!
Thank you!
Hey Mariko-chan...
right! Right!
They look like doll.
But what I feel now...
It means...
Then I couldn't have met Mama...
Better split these lines up some more.
How was everything?
Mama! I'm home!
when you were so young.
that Sana is my daughter.
Can you say something about your mother's book?
You look absent-eyed.
but I'm still in panic!
In that ordinary classroom!
The sun is falling...
You can tell it accurately.
Oh, yeah, it is.
And I am Zenjiro, taking the chair.
Yes, sir. Babbit...
eleven years old. Sixth grader and TV star.
He began bullying the teacher...
Weak spot?
peppers, carrots, celery!
Do you really know the answer? Hayama!
That was a difficult question.
here is the video for the second question.
Surprise! How 'bout it?
whatever sounds.
I won't let you...
OK.
He said Mmph just now.
You'll never understand my feelings!
It's all your fault, Akito!
Your home is weird.
or whatever.
Sana-chan faced Hayama with a wild heart in the shrine and said...
Dad.
a devil.
Welcome.
Here is a mischievous jump in quiz.
I kissed her.
I...
This is why I tried not to see you.
What will happen next?
What is the registration number of the car Rei always drives?
Obana here.
Answer this correctly...
and you'll get all the points the leader has.
You cannot be the object of Sagami-kun's love...
No way.
I feel...
That's not my name.
take a Nobia composing machine!
I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
In that ordinary classroom!
We became the merry-go-round.
Is it a sin if I sneak into your heart
He's running helter-skelter down the path of becoming the perfect manager!
What, do I sound funny? You're just imagining things!
Hayama Akito, my mortal enemy and best friend.
What is up?
Strike while the taiyaki is hot!
Thanks for doing that for me
The shame!
I heard you already met your birth mother.
...your mother's books and so on.
I don't have time to be Ionely.
Come quick!
I might get hyper on my own...
There's nothing to worry about!
Okay, who's the fight-starting wise guy?!
I'm sorry about all the fuss.
Is this Naozumi-kun when he was little?
Teacher, I want to do the same work Sana-chan does!
There's... no steak.
I'm told that you were a whiner.
The rhythm is nori-nori, kodocha pattern oh!
It's you, Kou-chan, isn't it!
So it is you!
Playing with fire is the leading source of bed-wetting!
He's just like Hayama!
You are a fool
A description: It can be written as May fly. I know that.
A fly, how awful!
When you say fly, is that fly in reference to me?
The cake is ready! You get the first piece, Sana-chan!
Rei-kun, who are you talking to?!
I made it...
You're afraid of heights, aren't you!
Now, now, Sana-chan.
This feels great!
Hey, come back here!!
Yup, she's an idiot.
Sana-chan, you can stop now.
I'll make it
I made something unsuitable to young girls eyes!
So boys of this age
Every little thing you say and do reminds me of Hayama.
Like I told you...
Go, go, go!
What?
Take a look. There.
You wrote Sana, welcome for me!
Thanks for helping me today, Hayama.
I waited for his reply
my love confession is on schedule
The existence is a mistake
You're asking for something not there.
The mysterious white bat extra character!
This is the last round!
I will win...
Bye, Rei-kun. No commercial for you!
of your chop would be ideal for karate.
I want to... take karate.
Thank you, sir!
I go to school, goodbye
So this is the 'Word Of Ear Corner'?
I'm a good for nothing... I'm a good for nothing...
Let's sing hey,
This is Narunaru!
That does kind of ring a bell.
Sana-chan, they're taping Kodoch a today, okay?
And I know that you will probably be real mad...
I don't want to think about quitting or staying on right now.
I don't want to go now
Yes, ma'am.
I came to see you!
Okay, it's time for a commercial break!
Like this, like this, like this, and...
He...
Sana-chan!
Meanwhile, at the Hayama residence...
Yes, sir. Thank you for dinner.
Akito said "Thank you for dinner"
so please don't worry.
I'm counting on you.
I talked to the producers of "Kodomo No Omocha" myself so it should be OK
Sensei! Yes, yes?
Thank you!
So please, Sensei!
If I quit,
Let me go! I'm getting off!!
Am I being avoided?
What do you think?
That day...
All right. First off you relax your entire body and align your head
so that it's directly above your rear.
Keep your arms close to your body, tighten your hand into a fist,
All right!!
I may have my mind made up...
Please don't be embarrassed.
is it the bad thing?
My dearest Mama is an Aoki Award winning author.
meaning my little sister.
Where are you aiming?
Hold it right there!
With other's defenses lowered, raise thy own defense.
Neeeewww! I don't have a boyfriend!!
Oh, but I did go to the amusement park the other day with...
Don't say whatever you want on the show!
The phrase Sana said so lightly...
Mariko is gonna go to the amusement park with Shana-chan!
A bit late on the introductions, but this person is Mariko's papa!
That's the spirit!
Yes. There won't be enough time to prepare...
Waah!! Where am I?
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry!
Wait, wait, wait!
There's something funny with my face, eh?
Mariko!
I told her to stay here!
She's around here somewhere.
Not realizing her parents' worry...
Mama.
A star's in trouble!
From who?
I understand.
I know! I'll have Hayama help!
Mariko is missing. Please find her!
It's long...
Okay. I'm really going to go home.
Okay, you can go home.
There's nothing else to do for quite a while.
Are you okay, Zenjirou-san? Fine!
Where'd she go?
First rice. Cooking adviser - Mr. Hiroaki Sakurai
I love this kind!
Press in the pickled plums too.
Pour in the tea.
I'm heading off to find her now!
We still have time!
Mariko's father.
It's my fault...
No, it's my fault.
No, it's my fault!
Move, move, move!
Okay, hubby, c'mon!
Let go! I'm going home!
You are all insolent fools!
I know nothing...
Honey!
Um could you go left now?
Gotta go! Gotta go!
I'd like to help, but I'm a tree so...
Oh! Mr. Indian Panda!
it's as if he's a different person.
You're happy aren't you?
I'm sorry.
Ahhh, poor Zenjirou-chan's had the worst day.
Now that it's happily ever after...
Are you okay, being so care-free?
The cliche...
I waited for his reply
I had everything planned out...
but today I digress.
You can tell it accurately.
Huh... give me the true kiss!
My dearest Mama...
Speaking of which, what are you going to do about junior high?
Still a ways to go... Sana-chan, it's still September.
Hey, Hayama! You scoundrel!
You know how our class was extremely behind?
you're supposed to be able to go to junior high automatically but...
Is 15 points lower...
Um, old- young lady?
from not being able to do math.
No, no, I want to become ajunior high student!
Look, all set!
You don't have to worry, you two.
There's nothing anyone can do about her math.
Sana-chan! Don't worry about what Hayama said!
...then you'll do as I say.
I wonder where he went...
what will it do?
To you in the mountains, the sky is far away...
What will I tell Sana-chan?
Why would you take it that far?!
Whoa! Leave it to Aya-chan!
You'll make a good wife...
But Akito-kun never listens to me.
Tsuyoshi-kun, what's wrong?
Shouting out my name that loud...
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said that you had no more make-out pictures but you lied!
Come here, come here, come here!!
What, what's going on?
We... have to convince Andoh-sensei.
A conspiracy is the secret planning of a wrongdoing.
Leave it to Sana-chan and the loud voice that she trained in Komawari!
I heard it for sure. Make-out picture?
is not to check students with tests, but to teach them...
You have a point.
I, I...
I certainly heard it.
If you want to see it that bad, I'll give it to you.
Limbo dance?
please don't be embarrassed.
Please, our relationship...
let's burn the fire of love.
A bit of a true Tokyo girl, Hisae-chan and then Mami-chan!
Hey, Kurosuke! I can't see him.
Oh, so pretty!
Oh, that's right. He gets diarrhea if he drinks too much.
Will you make it in time?
because of a sheep heard crossing the road!
No, don't!
Don't get all stuck up just
What cha doing?
Hayama!
Mami-chan wouldn't scream like that
if you didn't do anything to her!
Hey, Hayama... You're being kinda weird.
Couldn't be?
Couldn't be?
The kids who were commanded
She may even hate Hayama-kun for the rest of her life.
came by to check up on me, right?
Will you be at school tomorrow?
Isn't he so cute?
If you say things like that, I'll transform into a giant!
I don't want my friends to hate and be hated forever!
Happy.
Sana's Plan A, I guess!
Don't worry.
Mami-chan! Do you have a type of guy that you like?
What about THIS one?
What? I guess it didn't work...
Hayama...
You've really done it.
In that case, no matter how many band-aids you get...
Oh, thank you, Higashiyamato-san.
All right!!
I wonder if they'll know...
They will.
Along with her trophy for being able to fill the tray back up!
You're not allowed to drink more than where the straw reaches.
I want to see too!
I'm drawing a 'I lost at pool so this is my punishment game' person.
Yes, he's playing hooky.
Mami-chan, are you done?
you wouldn't have gotten sick...
You can't help something that's dead.
Kurosuke...
Hayama!
That rumor that I love you is true,
by ridding you...
You can tell it accurately.
I'm Kurata Sana!
Morning...
He said it doesn't matter.
Excited?
You go, girrrl!
All right, now, are there any confessions of yourself
This'...
No, I'll pass, 'cause, well...
So just say it babbito!
In the way?
You...
Aono-chan, what do you have in your purse?
An egg!
Never mind Akito!
And if it's at my house even if Piyoko crows a little bit,
this is the chicken that's going to
...or broken pieces of dishware.
I like you!
It very well might be.
This is your new home.
I don't really understand the question...
You always say that Rei-kun...
Turns out that I was the one
Wow I slept good! I'm all refreshed now!
Sana and Piyoko are still energetic,
That feeling, a bit of a
I'm the same.
to be stared at so intently...
W... wait a minute, Sana-chan!
Are you trying to pass this male chicken off on me?!
Hey! Sana.
so she should be found soon.
That will take in Piyoko.
Sensei!
A place where Piyoko can cry!
It's nothing.
If it's school, it's a wide open space
so you cry as loudly as you want!
I'm sorry for
That girl just has the devil's luck...
I've been practice for long
--Good morning.
It's really Sana-chan!
Sign this?
Speaking of which, Sana-chan, what are you going to do about middle school?
That's right... I hadn't realized it, but I'm going to be in middle school soon.
Listen, Hayama, young man!
S- Sea--?
Let's go junior high school!
with this school's escalator system, but...
Everyone should be tested to check their aptitude,
A- Andoh-sensei, when did you get here?
I always knew that 3rd Class was a troublesome, awful class,
Mitsuya-sensei! In cases like this, it is the way of the educator to deal harshly!
Are you okay with this, Principal!?
Sensei... Tanaka-sensei...!
Thank you so much.
I- it's not so much this, as all of it.
S- Sana-chan...!

 Remembering back to when I was in first grade, 
Chances are, you really could be at risk for going to middle school.
On tonight's "Child's Toy" we will be commemuhrating Sana-chan's 88 years.
--As your manager, Sana-chan, if I had kept a closer eye on your math. --Sensei! Your manuscript, please!
Middle school is part of mandatory education.
--Public school? --you've given me lately is "The Adventures of Thunderboy"!
Most importantly, Sana, you don't have any reason to be famous anymore.
That would mean being separated from Aya-chan, Mami-chan,
What's so bad about math!? What's so bad about math!?
Guys, stand by me, okay? Okay? Okay?
It's hopeless.
"Yaren 'sodan'..." Just kidding around.
Mitsuya-sensei said you didn't have any more reason to act out.
But why would he be doing this now?
Why are you doing this now, Hayama!?
You told me you didn't have any more make-out pictures, but you lied to me!
Why, you...! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
--Hold it! Hold it! --W- what's going on?
Hand over the make-out picture! Hand it over! Hand it over!!
There was my name, just now. Could someone be calling me?
Make-out? I know I heard "make-out picture"!
Hold it!
Oh, you guys...!
You've got some snot coming out.
--Sensei!
Yay!
This is...!
Oh, my! What should I do? This is so embarrassing...
--Let's limbo!
Andoh-sensei is going for a new record!
"Back against the wall."
In dire straits,
Hayama and Mami-chan... are you two really water that has spilled now?
Abandoning the other love...
7 O'clock News!
let's burn the fire of love.
Mama, an author, and the squirrel Maro-chan!
My ex-boyfriend, Rei-kun!
My favorite food is green tea rice!
Your hairstyle is weird as usual.
Well it's because I'm really...
What is this?
'Lucky Rabbit' Gapiyon?
What a stupid doll.
I can't help it!!
Let me borrow some cash!
Before that,
I need money for those kind
Unless I make some money before the day after tomorrow,
Oh! This?
Can you give in and think of helping me out?
and in return I get this stupid doll?
You're going to use me,
Lately, Kodocha has been too hard
Eh?! Zenjirou-san?
I wonder if I can ask him to work for me too?
It's okay! I said no.
Isn't that guy dangerous?
What do you mean by dangerous?!
And you touched my breast!
The story can't go on!
The comedic you!
Coming!
Go!
keep this hush-hush from Rei-kun and Mama, okay?
I'll introduce you to
What's going to happen!!
What are you doing to such a Kyoto
How?
Let's get on to the wedding cake!
The next wedding reception
...we have arranged something at your request!
Ouch
I promise you that.
He has a dimple!
Thank you...
Right, Secretary?
Whaaaaaaaat?!
So you guys really are a secret society?!
This is really good!
for lying about going out...
please return it to me. Ryousuke.
Now you see his true intentions?
I had everything planned out...
Aki!
If he has 'aki' in his name then could it be Hayama!
What's that, Sana-chan?
It's on Christmas Eve!
It's decided, it's decided!
Huh, why?
So what do you really want to say, Hayama-daddy?
...but she might resemble
I'm confused... That's not narrowing it down at all.
...Hayama-daddy's secret lover!
Sensei is writing a romance novel now
so she ties everything in with romance!
Life is a winding, confusing road of love...
The state of my dad?
Not really...
What about the case?
Oh, that's all right.
This isn't a play place for kids!
Uh, a strawberry parfait for me.
Aren't we being REALLY strange right now?
T... the worst?
Oh, I see... I'm the worst, huh?
Now that you mention it, I can relate a little...
Look! Romance is in the air!
Oh! Hayama's Sister!
Oh, so they're just acquaintances.
No... I don't want that...
When I see kids disagreeing to their parents' remarriage...
I don't know about a new mother or my real mother.
W... what the heck is going on, Hayama-daddy?!?
She was a friend of your mother's,
P... please excuse us for a minute!
Oh no! Oh no! Sana-chan, what do we do?
feel free to use all the dirty pool you want!
I call it the oh-you're-such-a-dumb
Rei-kun, Rei-kun!
All right.
He's gone!
Good evening!
And went on a rage in class flipping over a desk!
Shiori-san!
You mustn't get too close to Hayama-daddy without being cautious!
You understand!
When you see this weirdo,
singing alone?
So that means
And when it was summer:
she was really surprised.
Using the letters 'autumn' and 'person', it's 'Akito'.
Hey, Hayama! Don't go out in the yard without shoes on!
Let's sing!
Where will this kind of dad end?
In great distress...
He was there...
It's time to go home!
I'll burn it!
This is rare...
S... Sensei! I am so touched!
Yes! I shall now go back to the office!
The manuscript inside is from three years ago.
Even after screwing someone over she's still so carefree...
I am... Shizuka Kurata.
You really do go for food before flowers!
after she's decided on something.
Misako-san? You are the Kurata line's only daughter.
Next person.
Yes, I come from Kusatsu in Gunma...
I was such a fool back then.
even if the husband is a whiny weakling,
Anyway! I will refuse ANY man
What the hell kind of attitude is that towards My-Lady Misako, eh?!
I am a little late on introductions,
I had JUST for forgotten
You are the only person who can continue the Kurata-ya
Kurata-ya Welcome!
Hm? Me?
Heh, heh, heh. The abandoned child, meaning me?
However, regardless of what the officials say...
I suppose she does not have any intentions of carrying on Kurata-ya
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
How can you get into places like that? I'm impressed!
I'll have spaghetti with plenty of tobacco,
Just you watch, Grandma!
Are you SURE?
Are you serious, ma'am?
you must be very popular girl liked by thousands of people.
She's number one when talking about comer cial stars!
If you watch this video, I'm sure you'I...
I have him running a few errands.
What are you doing?
Yes, let me introuduce...
An arranged marriage for Sana too? An arranged marriage?
Who are you calling missy...?
I don't... t, think that it's a coincidence...
This isn't a 'seems like',
Let her do it! Let her do it!
You plan to sacrifice your daughter, Sensei?!
Being a head clerk...
Yeah, yeah! It's better to have a lot of brothers and sisters!
Huh? What is that?
And who the heck are you?
Well, I've got to go to karate.
What the heck?!
Sana-chan! You are the source of all laughter!
with Grandma for the first time in 4 years,
Mama flew!
Are you going to carry on Kurata ya?
I'll think about it!
I wouldn't be able to handle that.
We became the merry-go-round.
So the boy look back at me!
Today's incident is burning love!
He's a wonderful manager now.
Isn't it funny?
My Boyfriend is Clenched Out of Pride!
Well, that kind of goes without saying.
It's such a shock being Kim-kim
What does it matter?
Weee!!!! Rei-kun got into an accident
and we had to take the train so that's
Lucky!
In the highly anticipated drama An Angel's Kiss', a real love affair.
Oh, I see,
Right? Right?
Asako-san has a new boyfriend?!
Well... The world of fame is
full of handsome people, full of beautiful people!
Have you even seen her lately?
NNo! We can't!
Zenjirou-san! What's up?
I will tell you
Although I can beak him on quality.
With Asako it couldn't be.
Save Rei-kun!
and she sees Takuya-kun EVERYDAY at work.
Hey I bet saw you!
I cannot see very well from here. Over.
Finally, tomorrow is the climax, the kiss scene!
They seem to be REALLY close. Over.
He's boldly touching her! Over.
Where, where, where??!
Calm down.
Tsuyoshi here,
All right!
Wedding
Kimuchi's Danube,
There's something strange. I can hear singing.
There are bad kids too, eh.
It's a woman's dream
Hey, say those lines!
Here?
Only that.
So this lecture
Oh not at all! Ha!
Roger, that! Continue your investigation. Over.
and actress has to create those feelings.
Whaat?? I can't dance!
Bat going in and shooting during a date!
SSana-chan?
You're sadly mistaken
Why are you here?
Rei.
I trust you.
I have a press conference to attend so please excuse me!
I'm sure you know her:
for being the queen of quiz shows.
Knock it off! When I become
who are you?
He was there...
I'm Sana Kurata!
Don't put the 'super' in there!
You see, behind Naozumi - kun and me...
We were just waiting on stand - by.
Did he give you any gift? What do you like most about Kamura - kun?
Of course not! I won't stand to have anything happen!
There was a rumor like that from a while back too.
Kamura - kun defended Sana - chan, right?
but it's questionable.
If you run too far, I'll step on you!
This is my card! How do you do?
I won't answer anything!
N... No!
In Kodocha, you're always mauling Zenjirou - san, aren't you?
Come on, tell me, Sana - chan.
Saneyan, shut up.
What did you answer with?
Oh did you get it? You got it?
What's that? Did we just get our picture taken?
Oh, 'morning, Tsuyoshi - kun and others!
Not really.
Hayama - kun?
Huh? What's this? What's he thinking of?
Nothing!
It seems like he's not here anymore!
We had a call from Sagami - san at the office.
Hayama! Don't show your face!
Rei Sagami, right?
I just made it up.
Not at all, My hand was just a little itchy.
It's not some cheap trick...
where I take it and rip it up.
I'm the type to charge right back at those who charge at me.
I got it! Sensei!
Sana! Why don't you get engaged to Hayama - kun?
Do you know that...
it says that he may look like a snake, but inside he's human.
It's here!!
Wow, it is! She's the same as on TV!
Tatsuya, a rag! A rag!
What's this rag?
That's the head.
I've been on a cooking show before!
Welcome home!
A sudden conflict
What are you thinking?
Even if you are a snaky - old - guy your kids have grown up good natured.
Okay, let's do it.
Yay! Sana - chan said it's okay!
No problem, no problem! You father takes good pictures, doesn't he?
I don't care at all who gets hurt.
Wow, it's late.
Hayama - papa's probably worried.
He was there...
You can't ignore it either.
Please don't be embarrassed.
and starting to miss you...
The Aoki Award winning author, Mama.
Magical light!
The suspect, placed under arrest by police who arrived on the scene, is...
According to Matsunami police. Ohki stated -
According to Matsunami police, Ohki stated...
I... It's nothing.
Weird.
Morning! Let's eat!
I'm off!!
Mathematics, and social studies.
U... Um, Tsuyoshi.
Won't you get picked on at school...
Aono and I both think that he's a stranger...
Not really.
the two of you together?
The police?
What do you want, old man?
That man and I are strangers now.
and it has nothing to do with me.
Waah!! It's better to erase it, isn't it?
Dad really did something that was bad.
But now, I think he's regretting it.
Neither Aono, Onii - chan, nor Mom...
School's out!
H... He's wandering!!!
Yay!! I came in first!!
Why does Dad come up in the story here?
Because I...
Whoa, what a bold lie.
You're okay, right?
but there isn't anyone anymore, so...
You see, just go over from time to time...
N... No.
What kind of people?
It's a bad thing that Dad started a fight with some people...
But anyway, right now we're relieved!
Why do I have to go pick up that balding old guy?
He probably just doesn't know what to say to him.
In great distress...
but I'm still in panic!
We became the merry-go-round.
of your other love?
when the children go home,
Today's incident is burning love!
He's still dead-set down the road to being a great manager.
The teachers. Wow... this is heated...
It's the face of peace and friendliness
What are you doing over with these girls??
Who's wrong???
And then Mitsuya-sensei showed up and gave them a warning
Tanaka-sensei! Please don't encourage them!
This is what you call clean? It's still dirty!
Yes, I can understand that!
That's nottrue!
But, boys do hate cleaning so...
You're annoying...
Yeah!!
Hayama-sama... you come back to us...
Who cares either way?
The No clean up for us boys stay on the dirty side!
And what shall happen to the fates of these two?
Starting class!!!
Not the kind of shoes!
They boys won't do it!
I won't I can't forgive you for that one!
After you get married, you'll be the one crying

Definitely a path of thorns
It's a secret ok?
It's good!!!
Thank you for the food

To Learn the Spirit of Japan??
Trash created by the boys

How about letting Kurata-can be the dog?
Oh that! That's ok! I'll do it!!
She's not even near the level Mayu-chanis on.
Really?
It's rehearsal so I thought it'd be ok.
Sana looks really tired!
For some reason, I always pass here when I walk my dog...

But
It's the live shooting of a ski class!
has there been any strange things going on?
All okay!
Action!
Are you going to hand over Kurata - ya or aren't you?!
This is Grandma's precious resort so...
If that's the case then we can rethink things.
Ha! Yeah right.
Sana - chan and I are tied together by our destiny.
Wherever she goes,
That's great!

I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this.
My beloved Mama is an Aoki-award winning novelist.
Sagami Rei-kun, my chauffeur, manager, and former boyfriend.
--But you do have to be careful not to give them too much to drink. --I'm caught here.
--or else it will upset his stomach. --I said I'm caught here.
Ah, Sana-chan, that's enough.
Have some?
Mm-mm...
Can you stand?
Hayama!
Mami-chan wouldn't have screamed if you hadn't done something!
an8"Sana doesn't understand?"
You're the only one who thinks it's "after all this time."
Scars of the heart do not disappear over a mere apology.
Push it! Push it!
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Good morning.
Mm-hmm.
Mami-chan, is there a type of boy that you prefer?
Ah, they're eating it up.
One more!
We're the get-along bunnies!
This is kind of fun, huh?
In dreams, my eyes see you in dreams
But if you fawl, look, there's this cushion!
It's nice and sawft, and feels pretty good,
Ah, hello, Higashiyamato-san. Oh, what's with the hat and T-shirt?
I bought them for him.
"Sane-yan" appears to be a name that only Zenjiro calls him by.
No, I'm going back!

I wonder if I can convey that.
This week's Sana-chan!
Mm, art in the fall...
Hey, Mami-chan...
If I put a little spiral on his tummy...!
Kurosuke!
Yes, he is playing hooky.
Mami-chan, are you done?
--It could be dangerous if a car came. --It's been two hours since we've been away from the school!
Can't you fix him up right?
Mami-chan, let me hold Kurosuke.
Bring something to feed Kurosuke tomorrow morning.

Oh, you're playing Tanuki, huh?
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...

Haya-moth's pollen doesn't just affect humans
You shit guy!
Simple Sanbar, beat Mambo!
Sana-chan, how weak!
Tsuyoshi, you jerk...
But the pollen turns everybody into moths...
What will you do?
You fell for it!
You just wait! I'll kill you!

Good morning, Tsuyoshi-kun.
I'm troubled that some of the boys immediately loaf around
yak it up and dawdle around during cleaning time.
I'm on Kato-chan's side!
You mean this?
She's in the nurse's office.
Is that all? Don't go worrying Aya-chan like that, lover-boy!
I heard you're raising a chicken on the veranda of your apartment.
and is making everyone angry.
Chick!?
Aono-chan, what do you have in your handbag?
Uh-uh, it's the regular kind they sell at the supermarket in packs.
Huh?
I'm home!
Aono...
Big Brother has a favor to ask of you, Aono.
Hayama...
especially in front of Aono!
They really eat this sort of thing?
Sana-chan, where are you going to keep this chicken?
I think you're perfect the way you are now.
Why, you...!
 Piyoko the rooster goes cock-a-doodle-doo. 
Mm-hmm, let's both be strawng and foim,
and go on living without giving up, Sana-chan.
--Come get your roostuh! Hey! Hold up! Hold up! --Rei-kun! Rei-kun! Help, Rei-kun!
My plan to arrange a marriage for Piyoko failed.
A place where Piyoko can crow!
Okay, Piyoko...
The school is wide open, so you can crow as loud and as much as you want.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,

To all the new students, welcome to Jinbou Middle School!

Everyone's classmates, Sana-chan doesn't want you to treat her differently.
That girl is so scary with that accent.
Yeah, great! You tell them, Fuka!
You two, what makes you so much better than others?
Sign: Deia-vu This is my spot!
It doesn't suit you
Oh! Sana-chan! Akito-kun is in trouble! Come stop them quick!
Sorry
...the first day of school and he's already fighting?!
Mysterious kid?
I think it must be because of what he learned in karate
If you don't care about what she says, let's skip over it. Cut.
So that's how he feels when he looks at her
Geez!
Why don't you ask him the reason they fought?
I want to become friends with Sana-chan, because I'm her fan
Not really, I don't think that's too stressful
I really want to tell you her name but I want you to guess
In other words, looks really cute!
So in the end, what are you to me?
No, no, no... for the third time

My name is Kurata Sana, first year middle school student.
Aoki - Award winning author, Mama, the squirrel is Maro-chan.
Huh!
Get away, bra-less.
That's right, it's this face.
It's better to say you're outside in the mosquito net...
That happened in kindergarten.
why are you getting all worked up over something so stupid?
Fuka, cool down.
I forgot all about it when I moved to Osaka.
When I get to that age I will too...
Ah, you're annoying!
We got along really well with each other.
Ludicrous?
But regardless, he went to Tokyo anyway.
Matsui Fuka!
...don't tell her it was for money, even if it kills you!
Fuka-chan is really, really mad.
Kindergarten again today, boring.
Hey Aki, listen, listen!
From the 60 yen I got...
What? What?
Yeah?
After all the hard work, I'm finally making a name for myself.
Sana-chan's gonna star in a movie again?
Wow... really?
Yeah. Well, it's been decided!
Haven't seen you all day... Uh...
You're kidding me, you're one to talk.
See ya later, kiss devil!

I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna star in a movie.
First you draw one mountain... then comes the water...

And this is my picture!
What?
I was trying so hard... I can't take it anymore!
Hayama-kun is really scary.
Yeah! Cool!
You two are joining gymnastics together?
Don't read what other people wrote backwards!
Don't say it like it doesn't mean anything.
Listen, Hayama Aki!
Uh... yeah... I'm alright.
I'm gonna forget him!
That's right! That's what you should do!
Sana-chan is doing the old ladies' exercise!
Press conference! Press conference! Can you hear me? Press conference!
I'm sorry I'm late!
Hey, hey, hey...
Asako-san and Rei-kun seem to be hiding the fact that they're going out.
So you won't come to school once you start shooting on location?
elementary school, so when I saw him again I thought he was someone else.
Just looking at him, you wouldn't think he's such a girl-magnet.
Hayama is scary? Scary? Why?
But... but... when he was...
I don't even know this girl and to think she will have a picture of her and me.
Who does he think he is?
If you're gonna refuse, why can't you be a little nicer?
If I'm nice to someone I don't like, I don't feel that's truly being nice.
That Hayama. He makes a lot of sense.
Here goes the usual time skein...
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry...
Your mere words show you agree...
Decide to lift your spirits...
You will be feeling fine
I am Ultra Relaxed!
For lunch, I want to eat sushi...
Banana and strawberries in the sushi?
that's the way I am...
to wear for the press conference, it's the day after tomorrow?
Take a photo with Sana-chan...
Akito-kun...
Listen!
Sana? Sana, where are you?
Being nice to someone I don't like isn't truly being nice.
Scene change.
I wouldn't say lines like that! I really mean it...
I hope there aren't.
It's only the bloody nose classmate... still don't know his name.
Why are you running?
Don't do anything or else I won't forgive you!
To the people who are eating, sorry.
Yeah.
So, you should use today to spend more time with her...
Zenjirou-sensei!
Huh!
Your...
The truth is I and Sana-chan...
Blood squirting everywhere...
That's because he's nervous in your presence...
about you at all?
Eh?
Oh yeah, with your manager...
Really?
so I don't really want to think about it right now...
Sana-chan...
I want to buy something too! Is there a clothing store?
Wow! It's beautiful!
Eh?
Asako-san and Naozumi-kun...
Yeah... forgot to tell you.
The movie...
It's really weird though...
Don't think about things like that!
Why are you getting so mad over what I said?
At sixes and sevens.
Wait a minute!
Of course Sana-chan has a memorable part.
All my efforts for Sana-chan are wasted!
If that's the case, your popularity will be taken by Sana-chan!
I just want to act well for the movie.
Everyone... the press conference has started...
Sana looks like a totally different person...
Sana-chan is so cool!
But your heart is in no mood...
My, my, my, my, my...
Crying again after another loss...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
But your heart is in no mood...
Decide to lift your spirits...
Hayama Akito, who does karate, a passionate lone wolf, also my best... friend.
Matsui Fuka, best friend I met in the bathroom with an Osaka accent.
There's nothing between her and Kamura-kun except work.
The leading role in the movie is Naozumi-kun, right?
However, since this movie is shot from Nazoumi-kun's point of view...
Sana-chan, please stop!
That was scary, he's like a ghost himself.
Almost all the scenes are on location...
We can't see her for 3 months?
I don't want this... I don't want this either.
...because she's so busy... she's so cheerful and full of energy...
She's no longer doing this...
Yo, Onda. You don't have to worry, it'll be done in a minute.
Ah! Sensei, it's not enough just to fill the paper with letters!
It's useless, Onda-san.
Really?
Sana! Long time no see... you're still alive.
I'll do it when I get back.
That's right.
Aya-chan, you won't forget about me, right?
I was just a fan before...
Be careful, there's a tree in front of you.
Can you give me Kurumi Asako - san's phone number?
What if Asako-san sees it?
...we won't be able see much of each other...
We haven't talked much recently.
You worked really hard. I guess.
Eh?
Be careful, Sana, do your best!
Sana-chan, take care of yourself.
Hey, Sana-chan, hurry up, let's go!
Ok, I got it. You'll tell me when I get back, right?

What a super-lame doll.
It may be woik, but this is hawsh.
I can't take it! I'd rathuh be plunged into the abyss!
I'm in the middle of work, so bye.
With me?
Aren't you the most embarrassing one here?
Sana-chan, you're the only one I can turn to!
You can just think of it as work.
You mean we can make up your debt in one day, Uncle?
Back then... when you gave me this doll,
You can! Sure you can! If you can do it, you can do it!
bettuh paying!!
It's really him! It's really Zenjiro-san!
--Sure he is. I work with him --and be wearing this ridiculous costume!?
an8"You're sure about this, Zenjiro!?"
--I get excited just when our eyes meet, --I didn't want him to do those things! --It's not all that surprising, is it?
I place my hands on my hips and offer a hearty ha-ha-ha-ha!
an8"Gekidan Komawari"
if you want to improve your sensibilities, now's your chance!
Um, if you want Sana-chan, she's gone out.
Where?
Hold on, I can't see! Hey, what's going on here!? Hey!
All right, let's go rescue Sana-chan!
Now?
Fight, you guys!
We've done 27 events in a row.
--I can't take this! --Yes?
I read the book that Misako wrote.
I didn't know that Misako felt so troubled about not being able to have children.
They're planning to sell Kurata off overseas!
Hey, this is cheap!
You've already been working us hard all day up to now!
No matter how well Sana-chan can handle it, this is...
Stop! My showtime! The one I worked so hard for!
You guys were going to sell Sana-chan off. Akito-kun said so.
Ryosuke-kun is not such a bad person. I guarantee it.
Right, Boss.
Right!
he did say thanks to me.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I know, so go to bed already.
to always go along with the scenario.
Love-Love, Father Hayama's Song
In America it feels like Texas
With everyone together saying Bababababa!
My name is Kurata sana, first year junior high school student.
The amazing bat, Babbit. Babi Baki.
Eh? Is there anything I want?
Her name's Matsui Fuka, and she has a very strong personality.
Do you want to hear me say it, Hayama-kun?
Sign: Last night Ummm... this is my spot...
How have you been... No such thing...
It was that serious...? Don't bother to ask...
Takaishi-kun? Takaishi-kun who?
No need...
None of my damn business...
Wait!
Thank you! I'm for real, this is it!
Eh, where's Takaishi-kun?
She's a very quiet girl...
I'm fine, I'm fine, it doesn't matter anymore...
Let's go. Ok.
Yeah, we'll talk while we walk!
Hayama-kun...
...Doesn't talk much.
What's going on?
I finally told him!
Never mind... not a big deal...
Staying in this posture is tiring...
Your... boyfriend. Even if it's pretend...
...We're pretending to be dating...
And Takaishi is mad at you...
because the truth is he still likes me...
What should you boyfriend at a time like this?
Fuka's relationship is going so well...
What do you guys wanna eat?
I'm fine with anything.
Fuka... Takaishi-kun...
The end of sixth grade...
Ma-Matsui...
Huh, huh...
...but that was in the past...
I won't fight you for him
It's... over...
Really? Is it really over?
It's ok.
I'm sorry for making you do this especially when...
Is Hayama asleep already?
Your body has no energy...
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye...
Watch all this too...
Yay, yay, yay, yay...
But your heart is in no mood...
Your body has no energy...
Really? Is it really over?
You guys are very emotional.
That's not gonna happen, it's not a big deal
It's not a big deal?
I heard the filming process is going well
You're wrong, Naozumi-kun...
Kawai-kan!
Yeah, it's not even my first.
No, nothing.
It's okay...
If you don't know about the 18 year old age limit...
Do you mind?
Be careful. Yes, yes!
Is it ok? It doesn't bother you?
Adult's love... I don't get it.
and he doesn't want to become a big deal
I don't understand him
Of course, I agree with you, it's because of this.
Girls who don't wear bras are normal!
That's right, do you want to go down the mountain tomorrow to look at some?
Tomorrow both of us have filming in the afternoon.
Don't worry, don't worry, I'll be right back
A Bra!
Sana-chan, do you want me to drive a little bit slower?
Sana-chan's weird
What is kixa?
Ok! Good work!
To make it short, Naozumi-kun is off limits
Then what's this?
This is?
Maeda-san doesn't want me to do this.
The sun's ready to set, we should go home now.
It's impossible, don't worry about it.
Even though there's also times when after it's clear, it causes more problems.
But if it's true love, probably...
I have a chance to talk?
Even though there are a lot of blanks in the middle. Blanks!
That's a strange laugh
Yeah, just a little
Don't be too upset that I can't really take care of you.
Who is it? Rei-kun? Who is it?
Who is it?
Umm...
Yay, yay, yay, yay...
When in Egypt you do like the sphinx
Then you'll pull away!
Even shining heads go pir pir!
My name is Kurata sana, first year junior high school student
My manager, driver, Rei-kun. He's also my ex-boyfriend.
Hayama Akito, a lone wolf who does karate, now my friend.
working Hard Recovering From an injury
Sana-chan! Does it hurt?
My foot really hurts!
It's ok, it's ok, I was also taken by surprise.
Don't push her too hard
She just meeds to walk around slowly!
It'll be fine, I can do it
When I decide to do something, I'm gonna do it till the end.
...but...
...but...
She's full of energy
Yeah?
Don't act so worried in front of everyone because I got injured.
She's not gonna stop.
I'm alright!
He's been really depressed
You have so many good fans...
That's enough! Stop it!
I can't snap out of it...
I wanna beat them senseless!
Sana-chan!
What will you do? Is it ok, huh?
Can you see the bandage on my leg?
Kamura-san, Ok?!
Scene 61: Mako and Hiroto scene.
It's your brother who did this
As what Sana said
of emotional pain which turned her into a spirit
Sana-chan, let's stop and rest for today.
Hayama, I'll do my best...
You do your best too...
I'm gonna make a great movie for you guys to see
When you realize how much effort I put into this film
Get better, get better, get better...
Amayah...
Actually I told Sana-chan my feelings before she left
Don't make such a big deal out of this.
Do you want me to pretend to be your dad this time?
I'm not good enough
Seriousness... ness... ness...
Here goes the usual time skein...
Eh? Maybe very stupid
Really that's ridiculous...
It's alright! It's alright!
A little more acceleration at night
Bababababa!
I'm always relaxed
Will you be my real boyfriend?
Love Awakened After Loss.
Oh!! I got it I got it! This is good.
Noxzumi-kun just tine!
Yes?
How did it feel?
Hmm?
Hayama Aki!
Ku... Kurata?
Hayama! It's me it's me! Are you doing well?
Hey! Are you listening?
Fuka, is she OK?
Sana-chan!
I don't think of you and Kamura-kun as children.
I looked like such at idiot.
Hurry please come in.
Here. Don't say anything. You're welcome.
He's a leopard and a pervert and he looks at me funny.
You don't have to have a reason?
I... I really do love him.
I can't forgive Hayama for changing his mind.
I see.
Hayama, I try not to think about you,
What am I going to do? What should I do?
Sorry Naozumi-kun but when I think about you I say something very heartless.
For you Sana-chan,
Naozumi-kun...
Naozumi-kun...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Here goes the usual time skein...
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry...
Really that's ridiculous...
Watch all this too...
Your mere words show you agree...
Aoki-Award winning, author, Mama, the squirrel is Maro-chan.
Matsui Fuka, best friend I met in the bathroom with a Western accent.
S-Sana-chan?
The answer is... - 'Sana-chan Kanwaii'Cute Sana!
Yes. What's the problem? Sana-chan?
Please rest well tonight!
Sorry, Rei-kun. I made you worry about me.
Sana-chan... I have invited a wonderful guest!
How's your leg?
You mean 'hanging around'...
I know hat I must forget quickly
Please take a look.
Turn them into your own strengths?
Mm... What's the poor Onda-san doing now. Let's go see for ourselves!
I'm going off for a little walk, Mama.
Is that so?
I'm gonna learn from you.
I'm so touched!
Mail
Onda says, 'I'm too na? Ve to have trusted densei. '
No need to lie to yourself and oppose your feelings just for work.
Sorry about that!
Why didn't you ever mention it to me!?
Please don't scare me. I thought you were taking Sana-chan home.
That's right. It's not a time to worry and cause everyone trouble.
Oh, really Sensei?
If the mansion gets burned down, there is no chance to recover it.
Okay, c'mon!
But your heart is in no mood...
You will be feeling fine
Aoki award-winning author Mama!
Matsui Fuka, my buddy!
I still love Hayama.
Still no signal! Still no signal!
Go slow...
I haven't used it since I got to junior high.
If I die here...
I think of that Burrucha.
Just stop this, director!
I'm becoming weak, I... can't not go out.
What good are your efforts when your life is lost?
Sagami-san!
We don't have the budget!
It's impossible!
I'm waiting too!
Mako-san!
Heh heh, those two are inside,
Thank you.
You're blocking the words. I can't see!
Sana-chan, is your leg better? Is it ok?
I promise
Hi! I heard you came to apologize.
Yes.
all you guys like Naozumi-kun, right?
Heh, heh... To say this out is embarrassing.
Alright! I'm gonna eat now. I'm gonna eat now.
After we get back to Tokyo, I hope I'll see you again.
Let's go home Sana-chan.
Where's Sana-chan?
Let's get a picture
Why can't we use this one?
Sagami will come after he washes the apples.
How can you come into a sick girl's room!
Sana-chan
Last summer...
Exasperating!
It's just like the old set!
Sana-chan, Naozumi-kun, it's time to rehearse scene 90.
When the movie was finished, it was September.
Feeling down... as usual.
Can I still pretend it's business as usual with my friends?
Is it alright?
Huh... it doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Watch all this too...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
Hayama Akito
Episode 63: Don't Believe in Rumors
It'll be OK...for sure...
Is it finished? Yeah, it's over, over!
It's true, it's Sana-chan!
In the past 4 months, he's grown 5 inches taller!
Look up to...There's nothing to look up to, because there's nothing there at all.
...uneasiness...
Who's "Yin Tian Tian Gong"?
You've worked out all the numbers...not willing to be taken advantage of!
It's my turn, help me with my work please.
And she's also good at PE.
It's Tsuyoshi-kun and the others.
...you and Hayama...
I'm finished.
All right, just leave them there.
Can you go and help her?
I'm in a hurry, sorry. Thank god, it's not broken
Your homeroom teacher is really good.
He's changing on the inside.
This? Confusing guy
I have more responsibilities...it's more interesting than it was before.
...when did you start wearing a bra?
What are you doing? Big pervert!!
Why did you call me that?
...remember what your mom says...
Yes Mama.
It doesn't matter if the two of them are going out!
For you, Fuka.
...has Hayama kissed you?
So he treasures you!
...there isn't a woman on earth...
..who can comment on men, as if she knows everything about them.
She's got a sharp tongue.
Sign: Dying It's your own fault.
No problem at all!
It's like she's a natural born gymnast...
That's great.
I was a bit surprised but...
...it doesn't matter.
I'm so tired...
...I felt very lonely.
Akito-kun, what about Sana-chan?
She's so slow. Sanaaki: think he's talking about Sana here.
Hayama knows he's wrong but is still resisting.
When Sana is upside-down like this, she can't stop...
Like an unstoppable youth.
I feel as if there's a wall between us.
What are you saying?
You don't tell us anything.We feel left out.
Yes, it's because...
There were lots of rumors like this before...
Ishida?
All messed up... messed up?
I am Ultra Relaxed!
Don't forget to sort your garbage!
Are you two concerned for me?
It's true that we've held hands...
In short, even after dating two months...
...and I started to like him a lot.
...he looked depressed...
Was it a good thing to ask him "Will you be my real boyfriend?"
My cd!
That was really fast!
Jeez...
Let's go home. I'll walk you back...
Yeah, she looked like she'd been crying...
Isn't this nice? Isn't this nice?
...to be among my friends or to be in school...
The taping of the show...we haven't been there for a while.
Listen up! Listen up, Naozumi-kun!
What is it? Something happened in school?
Sign: "brainless" It's okay, why don't you just tell me? Ed. note: Sign really says "no nerves".
Sana-chan, it's about time.
Later!
This slide is designed to slowly decline every time it hears a lie.
Yes!
Sana-chan! Welcome back!
I'm so happy!
Would I really feel that life would be good if it involved nothing but work?
Welcome back!
That's pretty obvious...everyone's interested in it.
...at work we're very good partners.
Translated by Al.
And it's being broadcast nationwide!
Rei-kun!
Anyway I think of this as just a little joke...you can forgive me right?
...and I don't want him to know my feelings!
That's a lie!
Hey, Nao, you'll catch the flu that way.
Rei-kun...I wanna take a sick day from school.
...he doesn't talk much.
Good morning, Sana!
Last night? I was watching videos that my mom rented! Some story on this little pig.
I'm hearing this for the first time...
The truth?
Sana-chan and Hayama...
...like yesterday on TV...
You said you like me, what a joke!
How can I say such embarrassing things?
WHAT? You said it just now!
Anyway, my brain is as watery as fruit! Ed. note: implying there is nothing of substance within.
That looks yummy!
You liking me is in the past.
I thought a sprained finger should be no big deal, I was wondering what took you so long so I came to check up on you...
The one he loves is you!
You never understood his feelings...
Fuka!
I can't...
I can't pull myself together...
Sana-chan! News! News! Excellent news!
Hey, hey, but why? What happened to DrePro?
When they tried to interfere with you, a bunch of termites appeared and chewed out their building.
But they weren't great men!
Hey Rei-kun...let's accept all of them.
Sensei!
I won't break up!
Because I won't have time to come to school in the future.
I'm coming now!
Sana-chan...
But I can't, our friendship is over.
We haven't discussed this topic...
Let me help you do somersaults! Plus huge spins too!
We won't be seeing each other much in the future, so I came to say goodbye.
I just can't drop Fuka like that.
Of course. It goes without saying, Hayama.
If only time could stop... Sadness blows you in to cry...
I don't want any past... But I won't cry for yesterday...
...just this moment... God knows well where you're going to...
After that, Sana-chan...
soap operas, commercials, radio, movie, and comedy talk shows.
She's no longer a child actress nor an idol.
Sana-chan!
It's Sana-chan!
Get the hell out!
Is Sana-chan really that beautiful?
Huh? Sankyuu.
You...
There came a letter
From New York
My butt's so itchy.
...but that's all I can think about.
But...if...
This is what it means to be trapped.
Even if I manage not to think about it, there's always someone bringing it up again.
By focusing my energy on my job...
Hayama, let's go wash your face. Or it'll get sticky.
I see...
None of my business. This is none of my business.
I'm leaving.
Even though you already have a girlfriend, Akito-kun, you're still too cold.
Do you want to go watch Sana's movie tomorrow?
I'm going with Tsuyoshi-kun tomorrow, want to go together?
Actually, that airmail letter...
Talandalu is angry.
These are Mr. Hamilton's requirements.
Sana-chan...
Who else is here?
The charms of this movie are almost all gathered around you and Kamura-kun.
I'm now one of your biggest fans.
It's the real thing.
This is something an ordinary girl wouldn't be able to dream of...
It's going to be Middle-aged women's Toy...
There was a rumor that middle-aged women think of me like a toy...
Kodocha...
I can't believe it myself.
Sana...
Across the ocean.
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
My manager, chauffeur, and former boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun.
I'm Babbit.
Aki!! Hayama, your name is Aki-to! "Autumn"
Shut up.
Your birthday. I've been meaning to ask for a while now.
ever had a birthday party, Hayama?
I don't mean that! There's something popular
going around with the girls these days. "Middle birthdays."
Let's see, mine is on March 7th, so...
1, 2, 3, 4... um... uh...
To the cemetery.
Can't you just split your butt
Rawr! Rowr!
We came because Hayama invited us to come,
Oh? That's the kind of person she was, huh?
your mother...
For some reason, it seems like I've seen her somewhere before,
"Hayama says 'Eh!?'"
Sana-chan, thanks for coming along today.
I've got it! I'll bet Beautiful is really Father Hayama's secret lover!
Father Hayama's in love-love!
She's right.
Babbit, you're a disgrace to the whole family!
Girlfriend?
D- did you see that? You saw that, right?
They went into that shop!
How can we not investigate this, Washington-kun?
My investigative blood is boiling!
Not at all. Natsumi-chan and Akito-kun sure have grown up, huh?
There they are!
What do we do?
A-awful...?
Bingo!!
You finally got over being a chicken-and-egg dum-dum,
You only think about your own love-love!
Dirty campaign?
"She's here..."
It's decorated to Father Hayama's tastes!
Yes, Father Hayama buys the most unique and trivial things by mail order.
 since I'm just a little shy. 
 But I'm still a dandy Father Hayama. 
You're still in your third year of middle school. Marriage would be...
Not me! I mean your marriage, Dad!
Then, judging from your reaction,
After all, we get to eat snow-cones and watermelon!
she was honestly surprised. "Shiori, how did you know? How? How?" she asked me.
...Natsumi...
Thanks. As for the rest of it...
Getting self-conscious?
He's a shocking father, our Father Hayama!
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 29, the Disruptive Grandma from the Hot Spring Resort saga,
She's Here! Mother's Mother
New York huh..
I'm from Tokyo.
Welcome to America.
Welcome to the U.S., are you visiting?
I suppose so.
The guidebook says it takes an hour to get there by taxi.
You are Kamura Naozumi right?
Pleased to meet you.
I can't move Nao.
You're too close to the camera.
Please come this way.
This is our weekly ball.
I see.
What's with her attitude?
Come on?
We'll take care of your rooms.
The guidebook says Michelle Hamilton was a famous Broadway costume designer.
But this book says she's the queen of Broadway.
Do we look alike? Don't be joking.
If he were Hayama, "Akito do you like Sushi?", "I don't hate it" Signs: Hayama, Brad
If you have anything you don't understand, ask Mr. Brad here.
Ok, come with me.
Yeah.
Because Broadway is a very crowded place, you should go back early.
Goodnight!
Because in my family we have a servant and her name is Shimura-san.
...draw the arrow shaped eye...
Sana-chan!
20 KG, it should be easy to lift up.
There's not gonna be a crazy car, or a crazy horse after you enter the house.
Come on smile!
Normally you're supposed to say that it tastes really good right?
Rei-kun call an ambulance!
Sign: Who's behind this? Next is a car in America.
It's Mackvakiavan. Ed.: I think I got his name!
You mean..
Yeah that part sounds weird too.
What?
Really that's ridiculous
If this song you sing is trouble then it's
Bye Bye Bye
Start talking to others
Whoa, he looks identical to my old friend. It's Brad!! He's American.
Episode 68: Experiencing the mysteries of life.
Here.
I saw it, you know...
Everyone...
Mr. Hamilton is New York's Broadway's king, number one producer according to Talandalu.
Your first class is today.You won't have a problem, right?
Oooohh..
Ahh...
Argh!
All right then, I'm running late for my plane so...Bye!!
Argh!
What happened?
Sign: What the..?Tires burst in Japan too.
Yeah.. although it hasn't reached 10 yet..
Famous?
Artiste?
Sana-chan!
Hey Michelle, are you serious about this? These twobabies are actually movie stars?
Yeah...or else things wouldn't be like this right from the start...
But I can't take this lying down...
Well, since they think we can't do it, we'll provethem wrong by showing them something whetherit's tango or waltz!
Right! Naozumi-kun, gimme a beat!
Sana-chan, you're jumping into something without looking again.
I'm dancing too!
Sana-chan! Hang in there!
...drawing on the left, drawing on the right...
...Ku Ku Ku shapes...
Ah! You're the guy with no manners fromyesterday!
There's all sorts of people here.. if their actingroles were taken or replaced, who knowswhat they'll do...
We came here because of the musical ... not just for ourselves ...
Eh? What? You want to carry me? No need ...
No, I've just been horribly trained by Michelle-san.
Hm, I suppose so ... maybe she hasn't really understood us I guess.
I guess so...
Well, it seems that we've really been targeted huh?
probably because he cast the both of you...
But she had legs so she couldn't be a ghost anyway.
This is ..

I think you have the same emerald-type of eyes as well.
My best partner in New York, Naozumi-kun.
But it can't be helped, ma'am.
Not Sona!
The person who trashed your rooms wasn't me.
Naozumi, Sana, don't you have any sense of being professional actors?
Don't you have an early morning meeting with the stage manager tomorrow?
Mama...
Come with me.
This week's Sicil-chan.
I took a photograph from Daddy's files, don't tell anyone, Brad!
Naozumi's eyes are blue too, just like mine.
This is the beginning, Naozumi-kun!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Pushups too. Why?
You must be Naozumi Kamura.
I want to confide in someone but I can't.
Yeah. You are...
This week's Sana-chan.
Are you alright? You're spacing out.
Really, I'm fine.
Michelle-san? Sicil? Brad? Or.. or..
They thought these knives were real.
I'm really really moved! Great!
The car suddenly came at us, and the chandelier also fell.
Hm?
It will be a pleasure working with you.
Naozumi...
What the hell are they thinking?
Wait a minute, let me talk!
It's the same color as mine, isn't it?
We will do our best on stage!
Japanese!
Can't you think of anyone else?
I told you before that Sicil didn't do anything wrong!
Eh?!
That must hurt.
Ooops, wrong sign! This is for another sequence!
I have tickets to go back to Japan if you still need them.
I told you that we're staying!
Please come with us, you're the manager after all.
Hey slow down a little! You think someone is targeting you?
Sicil-chan!
From today on we will practice a new lesson!
Your part is later on. Go practice your lines outside.
Yes. That's all of it...
Ah..they were watching.
We did it again, I guess...
You old dirt bag!
Sicil-sama! Sicil-sama!
The roses are...
Sicil disappeared? Gone to his place maybe?!
If you have a fever your face turns red
If you have a fever your face turns red
You need to rest when you have a fever.
Hiccups, already six, it doesn't stop.
I made this, isn't it great? It's a present for you, Naozumi!
Listen Naozumi!
Sicil, you can't go see Naozumi-kun without telling Michelle-san first! Don't make her sad!
Staying at the hotel will get expensive for them in the long run.
Should we try...
You don't mean that.
I guess. I am a servant of the Hamilton's after all. And Sicil is kinda like my little sister.
Gary?
HEEEEEELP!!!
If you had just turned tail and run back to Japan all this wouldn't have had to happen.
Huh..Gary?!
Are you all right, Naozumi?
My strongest ally in New York, Naozumi-kun.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm Gary Hamilton.
It's your doing, isn't it, Brad?
You owe me an explanation.
Brad, you...
Welcome back.
My only reason to live was to meet you once again.
It's true. I truly wanted to...
Ho, it's Rei-kun! What's the matter?
Green floral, it's nice.
Green Floral.
It calms you down. Perhaps you prefer the trumpet, ... but it's useful when you can't play the trumpet....
It seems quite old, don't you think?
I'd like to go on a trip to Kononkania.
Sagami-san!
Come in!
Yeah, it's good. Don't you think so, Naozumi-kun?
Ah, he is-
When I was in the city, I was embarrassed about not finding a room.
I don't know your situation, but even if you've got no mama, you've got a papa, so it's okay.
It will be done soon, so expect something good.
Today I hate it.
I'm not thinking that.
What? That's all?
Sicil-chan's laughter sounds like an angel...
I'm sorry. I'll go rest now.
It's an omelette sandwich.
Thank you, but...
Eh? No...
I'll eat it tomorrow morning.
Bye!
We're always on break, aren't we?
I'd like to be dancing more...
Yes.
You're happier this way, aren't you?
Which in turn means...
What's up?
No! Because mama hates me, doesn't need me, and because I won't leave Naozumi!
What is it?
We are serious.
Sicil's so... cute isn't she?
Just something I forgot.
Is it all right? Hurting him like that?
Worrying about my son is not your problem. It's my own business. I went through a lot of trouble to set this all up!
Now it's your turn!
Come inside! Are you hungry? I made some delicious pie for you!
I will find it in a moment.
Eh?
Mother?
You can play on all these thing here!
But now I think it's good that I've met you. Even if it's just knowing that my mother is alive. I'm happy about that.
Tendon, yuudon, oyakodon, note: traditional japanese dishes. Tendon is rice and fried fish.
Eh?
She hugged me, and cried.
Somehow I feel relieved. Thank you for listening to me, Sana-chan.
What's with the scary face?
I told you I'm not going back! Not for Papa, Mama, or anyone else. I made up my mind to stay here.
Everything is so much fun when I am with Naozumi. It makes me so happy!
Come on, let's hurry! Naozumi will be hungry when he gets back.
See you later, boss.
Go home!
Sicil will get hurt along with you! If she falls for you, Sicil will..
I'm not lying! Gary-san checked it carefully.
Hold on a sec..that means..if Sicil is your sister then Gary-san is your fa..fa..eee...I don't get it..I'm not good in math. ;;
Sicil is.. Sicil is.. my..
Idiot! Do you wanna die?
Good-bye!
Naozumi!
What happened to you ? You're completely soaked.
For me...
Has Naozumi lost his way?
Ah! Then I'll ..
I'm becoming worried too.
Hi! I'm Sagami Rei, are you Naozumi-kun?
Are you Sagami Rei-san?
I'm so sorry that he has put a stranger to such trouble.
What do you mean, don't bother anymore about it?
No problem, bye bye.
Yo Sicil, Bernie! They've found Naozumi-kun, he's safe! You can come back to supper now.
Ah, you're awake ?
You just rest, I've already told your manager. Sorry...
We can't let you become feverish again, so you just lie here some more.
What are you saying? I'm his mother, I should be the one thanking you.
This is the place that you meant to come to, right?
Yes, she told me so.
I'm not being superior, just praising you ..
Of course I won't say anything.
That's true, that's true.
??? baba
I'm late! I'm leaving now.
Welcome home.
I come here and he leaves again.
Naozumi is trying to avoid me, he's sick of me.
That time I fell from the stage, my leg tendon snapped.
So I think that this time, he can help himself too.
When that time comes, let's hope that you won't be worried and indecisive over ridiculous things.
But you still think like this - isn't that ridiculous?
It was when she knew that I would never dance again.
I don't want a child who cannot dance, I don't want her!
Michelle Hamilton's child isn't allowed to not be able to dance.
And there are a lot of people who love us too.
The world is not so bad.
Yu...?
I'm Kurata Sana, first year Junior High School student.
Yes.
What?
Episode 74: Mother's conspiracy.
I am confident that this performance will be a success.
Gary.
Thank you.
Bring her in.
Moving Naozumi's heart.
Ah! you're that guy from last time!
Mister!
I only told him the truth.
You and I neglected Naozumi.
Whatever you say now won't change anything.
It's not the time to hear it reversed. Note: Babbit used Sana's toy to hear everything Gary said backwards
From the looks of it, I can only count on you.
I am here. Contact me if anything happens.
Can it be, be careful of candles in case...
The one you mentioned last time?
You'll also attend the party, right?
That woman has finally done it.
Thank you.
Right now, Naozumi-kun has a mountain pile of troubles that he has to deal with.
I don't believe it means I don't believe it.
There is someone who acknowledges my skills and talent and is paying money for me to perform, am I not right?
This "script" was written as an aid - a hybrid of mostly Chinese and some Japanese translations so discrepancies will exist...
Next week on Kodocha number 75, "Tale of a girl's suffering in New York!"
Manager, Rei-kun.
Broadway choreographer, Michelle Hamilton.
Their only child, Sicil.
That's...
What's wrong with that?
If you're going to lie to him, at least continue the lie.
Naozumi, is she jealous of me?
I wish we could keep walking through this forest.
You're jogging at this late hour?
Just as you thought? Naozumi-kun, did something happen?
Rei-kun, phone!
What's the matter?
I don't care. I'll give you my life.
Michelle!
What?
Sagami.
What?! There's a girl who's thinking about jumping from the billboard of a theater?
Translated by DarthYang.
Folk dancing is a happy kind of dance.
Why don't you dance with that cute girl?
Hiccupping. Six. Can't stop.
Where?
Sicil!
Yeah. This is the theater where she hurt her foot.
Great!!
I still have hope.
It's not Sicil.
At the construction site at East Second Street...
Sicil, I'm going to rescue you.
Don't tell me Sicil...
She thought that if she slept with the lions, she might dream a very happy dream.
There's a young girl who's fallen into the Hudson River.
Everyone lies to me.
They just needed someone to take my place.
She's here safe!
Can't make out what you're saying anymore, Rei-kun.
Papa.
Mama.
Thank God.
Please continue to be his mother.
I want to be with Mom.
I promised Gary that I would break all ties with you.
I...
Hi. What will happen on next weeks' Kodomo no Omocha?
What's wrong with that woman? Seriously!
In America, it feels like Texas.amerika kibun de tekusasu
If you're there it's as if you're powerless.funyafunya de iru to
Simple as a temple.wabisabi kikasete derakkusu
It feels funny.
Sana-chan...
Good morning, Papa, Mama.
It's not bad, this kind of thing. From now on, we can always do this...have meals together.
Alright?
It's a big job, but we don't HAVE to do it.
Because you're here to support me.
Who are you?
If Naozumi comes...
I'm sorry, Rei!
When you came, I knew you would have to leave someday.
Bernie.
...but please use it.
Sana, thank you.
We've been through many things since we came to New York, but...
Coming to New York...
Hello, this is the Hamilton residence.
S-Sicil.
We've decided to go back to Japan.
But I'm glad I was able to hear your voice one last time.
Who's that?
Ooh...my name is Sana Kurata.
I-It was from a friend.
I'm sorry, Naozumi.
Bernie!!
Why are you looking at me all of a sudden?!
This place is Gary-san's office.
He decided that on his own...
Look, isn't it a shame?
And you are...?
What's this? What's going on here?
Great, Gary! We're waiting to enjoy it!
Thank you. Excuse me for interrupting your job.
Hi, Bernie!
What will happen on the next episode of Child's Toy?
Gary-san came and took Naozumi-kun.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
and for an American feeling, Texas!
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
S- Sensei, I'm touched!
Be careful.
Right!
Sensei, you're such a scamp.
Now then, I think I'll treat myself to a little tub time,
Kusatsu is such a nice place...
so it would have been four years ago.
--Why has Mother suddenly showed up here once again? --Yes... Yes... That's right...
Look, once she has spoken, she won't listen to anyone anyhow.
After all, you are the only daughter of the Kurata family.
Please let your father have some time to relax without your mother around.
Dad! What do you mean, the buses have left!?
Too many syllables.
Yes, hailing from Kusatsu-
Isn't that the type of man you like? I mean, look at Kashima Ryosuke-san.
In any case, I absolutely refuse to have that type of man!
What kind of a trick is this!?
Mother, do you seriously think I am cut out to be the mistress of an inn?
"Prospective fathers return home"
Don't worry, don't worry, it's the truth.
Yes, ma'am.
while the Kusatsu hot springs are over here.
Unusual? I don't know.
If she were her blood granddaughter,
I'm sure she would come see her more frequently.
There's no way she'd fail to come see her for four years.
a jumbo pirate salad, a fruit pawfait, and Milfie espresso, if you please.
Whose idea was it to bring them out like this!?
Hi, welcome, come on in!
Aren't these used to measure the temperature in the room and such?
Search me.
Indeed, that was absolutely wonderful. I, Katagiri, am deeply impressed.
This will work!
Katagiri!
You're going to leave Kurata Inn to Sana-chan?
There is nobody else besides her. Make preparations at once!
Let me tell you, right now,
an8"Ruse"
Allow me to introduce him. This is...
Toriyama-kun, you're fairly comical, yourself.
Mm-hmm. Look there...
Isn't that a coincidence?
Let them proceed, let them proceed!
It would appear that those two are getting along well.
I like the look in his eyes!
H- hey!
To celebrate Grandma coming to see us for the first time in four years,
Mama went flying...
There is no guarantee that at some time,
In dire straits,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
...up to now, just for today,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
And our usual classroom...
Episode 77 : Papa, this is all your fault!
Who cares what the adults are fighting over, what's the big deal ?
dance ... Babbit
Oh Naozumi-kun, you seem to be very energetic today.
People who talk to themselvesBe quiet!
Long time ago, hmm .. already 14 years I guess..
When I was still young in Broadway I had some fame already and because of some joint project I went to Japan and met Yuko.
Babbit's Counting Song
Crying, laughing and steaming, sticking your tongue out
Scared?
Ahh .. don't be shy, speak up. This is what the Hamilton family lacks I suppose. We'll be over there so please discuss this slowly.
Well .. err .. today's weather is good
What is it?
Sana mentioned that .. err ..She mentioned that Sicil might be afraid ..
Nobody wants? Sicil?
You heard it .. you heard it didn't you?
That's right Sicil.
Don't be so serious about it. Blow me some tunes.
Hello.
To wrap things up, everything was my fault.
All along? Starting from when...?
Sana-chan is still as slow as ever...
Can I come out now ?
What the...? I was going to tell you two to scram anyway!
Naozumi-kun ..
I can't wait to meet them.
But how is Naozumi feeling?
And now our premiere is coming up.
The friend I trust most in New York, Naozumi-kun.
My dream has...
Don't catch cold.
"Let your brains be blank"
Let's go.
How can you say this type of thing to your own mother?
Because you are my son.
I'll prove it to you on stage.
It makes me so mad.
But...
It's my fault! My fault!
Really? No wonder, that's great!
Today's finally here.
You're crisp as a radish chip today.
Because you've been here, I've been doing my best till now.
Mexico, Mexico.
Sanaaaa-chaaaaan!
They hit it off right when they met.
Shake hands.
Sensei! But your promise.
The rice balls have Mentaiko in them, sorry!
Maeda-san! Why are you here? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Don't worry, this performance will be a success.
No, there is no difference in their ability to move an audience.
I dreamed I fell on stage and then jumped around by myself.
Sana-chan...
I can't move.
Translated by Crispi.
It's almost time for us.
Sana-chan.
It's just a giant school concert.
Erk, they've started!
If this continues, Naozumi Kamura won't be able to go on.
Oh, I was too serious up there, I'm not too sure myself.
We couldn't tell at all, that was a great performance.
It's a good thing Bernie's here.
Um, uh, I feel the same.
Sign: They're both awesome.
Hearing Mama say that makes me feel kind of shy.
Naozumi Kamura is my son.
Gary!
For fans by fans  - Oh yeah and please don't claim it as your own either...Thanks!! Translated by Crispi. Encoded and final editing by Sanaaki. Timed and edited by Malinshki. - KTP dreamteam
Next, is Kamura Naozumi-kun.
From now on,
Wait a minute...
Hello. World Magazine?
The sun rises really fast in this anime.
They've escaped. After them...
Sicil? I have something I want to discuss with her too.
Why is she suddenly...
You dare to play this way with me...
I've seen Naozumi's stage performance.
Your good intentions make me very happy.
I want you to continue practicing your performance skills here on Broadway.
Look, your work schedule is already so full.
Look.
This way you'll get the chance to become a big star in America.
Even though you still have things that need improvement, you have limitless potential.
What! You want to go home?
American quality brand...
You have work for us when we return?
Good job everyone.
Tomorrow is the last day. I'm going to go greet the other people first.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
It's a party to congratulate everyone on their hard work.
The reports seem to want to take a picture of me and Naozumi together.
Yo.
Why would I say this? Because he is my son.
What's the matter, Naozumi? Why aren't you smiling?
That's really great.
Please say something, Naozumi. Please express your feelings.
You asked me here because I was an actor.
You're really returning to Japan?
It's all Papa. It's all his fault.
You jerk! You're obviously crying.
Ok. Who's stupid? You're the same.
Please come any time.
Naozumi-kun and I have perhaps become stronger than before.
If you sing, then you'll be arrested for breaking this weird law.
The stage is a city like New York from the old days.
Tomita Mayu-chan's the special agent responsible for arresting violators of... the song law.
This has created a huge uproar.
It's ben a long time since I've been back!
Ok, Zenjirou-chan, Good work.
Babbit remembers.
Oh no... Everyone run!
Wait a minute!
Can you?
Just watch me.
You're even snoring! What do you think you're doing?
Quiet! Arrest these two people!
Ah, we accidentally sang!
This time I'm really out permanently.
I'm entering a new country!
Are you okay?
We're here.
Hi, Hisae-chan.
I've just arrived here.
You guys let down your guard, didn't you?
has been photographed by this instant camera as evidence.
Just now he produced a note.
However, I'm now considered to be a farting woman by Naozumi-kun.
Yo, farting woman.
She escaped.
Yes, it's a very strange law.
Yes, but we'll never give in.
Jump!
Naozumi.
It's possible.
I thought that I heard singing.
You can tell she did just by looking at her.
Yes! I understand.
Sing! Sing! Sing your hearts out!
That's right. We've got her! Thank God.
...don't want to arrest you.
If you play it, I will arrest you.
Sash: President Everyone, I'm really sorry that I passed such a weird law...
Everybody sing!
Dance on the dark bridge.
Crying again after another loss...
If this song you sing is trouble then it's Bye, Bye, Bye...
Your mere words show you agree...
When in Egypt you do like the sphinx
In America it feels like Texas
Bitter feelings are really strange and dizzy
Even shining heads go pir pir!
Why are you two still awake?
Let's all watch how it happened.
I can't believe we went to New York together.
...together.
...together.
Because of you...
Hey Aki, listen, listen!
Aki, where are we going? Don't worry about it.
Elementary school graduation, Takaishi tells me he likes me.
12 years old, we kiss for the first time.
I don't know what's in a ghost's mind...
When the set is ready,
Maybe longer.
What do you want to tell me?
I'll lok forward to hearing it, Hayama.
What what, what do you want? Naozumi-kun.
...love you.
Right now it's break time.
Why? Why are you crying?
I'm sorry.
Hell
Sana, you're looking into things.
That... did you all believe that it was true?
...frankly, you and Kamura-kun get along very well together, right?
Of course we get along well! We're friends!
Tell me the truth!
Fu... Fuka...
So please tell Fuka to forget about it all.
Maeda-san!!
Reverse the earth's rotation
At this rate, you'll be first!
Simply singing for a relax
Even shining heads go pir pir!
Sigh: School!! Long time no see, I'm Sailor Babbit
Wearing a flower on your head is not fashionable anymore
Fitth perlod
That's great, Akito-kun
What... it's so dirty
It looks like they're having a lot of fun
How much longer?
Love story between a pretty girl and a handsome guy, it's so... great
So you consider them good looking?
Tsuyoshi-kun, pull yourself together,
Shut up
Is it good?
Akito-kun. But, we're an oven better match
Especially Hayama's
Ok
Are you all right? I'm ok
Hey, Hayama, are you ditching class?
Eh? Is that true?
Look, it's just a scratch
Akito
Hayama-kun, is your girlfriend all right?
That's right, you, this experiment is a group effort
Akito-kun, don't say it that way...
What are you talking about?
...made up of the characters TOWA and ICHI, 2 HA's and eye and Mata...
One and two, and one and two and three...
Maybe I need to be careful not to get hit by a... car... Hair on your heart is not dependable
Could it be Sengoku-sensei actually has a thing for Hayama-kun?
I like you, Hayama, Hayama, Hayama...
Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way...
Maybe we are a little slow
Can you spare a few minutes of your time?
It's a popular magazine
You really are ali... the... mo... ron
We have a column specially designed for romantic couples on the... street
That's right
I took all the pictures
It's so cheap
You look very upset, Tsuyoshi-kun
Don't worry, it won't be published
I didn't hear what they said back then...
Once again
Yes sir
Akito, things are getting more serious
I have to borrow your student... list
It's like this... I'm here to talk about Fuka's boyfriend Hayama Akito-kun
It's alright! It's alright!
Then you'll pull away!
With everyone together saying
I'm always relaxed
Best friend I met in the bathroom, Fuka
Now he's going out with Fuka
Eh? We can't settle it curtly
Sign: Fuka, very worried Waves are tossing in the ocean
Come here for a second
I'll go change my clothes first
What is it?
I went shopping with my friend
You...
He just hates Akito, he sees him as an enemy!
Fuka, Papa and Mama didn't say you can't be with him,
Fuka
Let's just think this is all Sengoku-sensei's fault,
Babbit's Counting Song, Babbit is going to sing with gusto!
I wonder what's in it
Why didn't you tell us?
Hurry back, Sana,
How was the New York trip?
school, going shopping, or going out, instead of going straight home is bad
Sana-chan is shooting a commercial with Naozumi-kun
It's Sunday
It's the picture making him look like he's gentle and dependable
Then what did you just say a minute ago
Can I tell them that the couple in the magazine is here?
Hey, over here...
We can help Sana-chan cheer up
and a lot of her friends were going to come
We're all friends, right, Akito-kun?
Yes, thank you for taking care of Sana
I didn't know that
I'm tired
We can't beat Sana-chan
It's like afternoon naptime in kindergarten
But we eventually became friends
Naozumi- Kun is simple too. Ah? What are you talking about
I'm a very good person
Having a relationship, I'm not sure what is means
If you said it earlier, I would have been even happier
What? What?
Eh? Maybe very stupid
Really that's ridiculous...
At this rate, you'll be first!
It's alright! It's alright!
No problem
A little more acceleration at night
When you're calm you always get a shock
Is this true?
He's a problem child
Akito is not that kind of person,
Hayama, this is great.
See you, Bye bye! Good Night
Sana-chan looks energetic
Fuka-chan and Hayama-kun, Sana-chan and Naozumi-kun
that we won the best couple prize
Let me see
If you think of bad things,
you'll be UN-HAP-PY
You're saying...
I didn't say I don't want to go. Wait... Hey, Akito!
Hello. is this Matsui Fuka's house?
Right! I have to work hard today! Work! Work!
Huh? It's not good?
Naozumi-kun! We'll work hard together!
But this is decided by the agency
Yes, we have been through a lot together
Chris-chan!
it would be terrible
Sana-chan, thank you You're welcome
You can dance? Me too
Sana-chan, let's work well together! Same here!
Fuka!
How surprising! Babbit's...
...ear hole is tiny!
One, and Two, and One, and Two, Eight
Never come to this restaurant
Sorry about this
That guy...
I didn't do anything to make people misunderstand me either
Akito-kun!
Was Akito that bad in his old school?
Eh... how should you say this...
Is that so?
Akito! Sorry for coming here to look for you
Can it be that you have had a fight with your boyfriend?
Hey, Fuka, can't you say something...
Relaxing is very important too
But Sana-chan was great from the very beginning
In this world, even if you are friends...
Look at yourself closely
Ho! Ha! No idea
This felling is great!
But your heart is in no mood...
Before I apologize... l'll laugh till the end...
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye...
Bitter feelings are really strange and dizzy
With everyone together saying
I'm Kurata Sana, Grade One student ofjunior high school
The amazing white bat, Babbit. I have something to say today
Is it okay to let Sana-chan stand in the spotlight all the time?
I'm sure everyone's heard the rumors.
But I'll try my best
Are you the screenwriter?
For the two actors please,
I feel that private and professional life shouldn't mix
Really?
I...
You really didn't do anything wrong
Vice versa...
Never mind. I found the wrong person to talk to well
If you and Hayama are not compatible with each other...
Cheer up more, ok?
I know. Thank you. Thank you very much
Um, Fuka-chan is very stressed out because of this.
You have just declared your feelings, and you'll play a couple in a drama
What are you doing, Akito? Jealous?
...let me show you something cool
What thing?
Akito, you...
Fuka...
ei in hi ei san is...
One and two, and one and two and Four...
One, and Two and One, and Two, Six...
For those who don't know karate, don't try this at home...
Hi, Naozumi-kun
Sana-chan, you just received the script?
I didn't know
The correct term is cook some fingernail dirt
And Naozumi-kun Technically, yes
Hey Akito-kun, are you going to karate today?
I know
Sana-chan, this scene with Shinji is all yours
Naozumi-kun, be on stand-by ok?
You're quick
I can't take this. Wordy!
It's hard to say that line
Fuka, do you have two hundred yen? I'll pay you back
I said, get out of my way
Brat
Escape!
I'm always relaxed
Manager and Driver, Rei-kun
Tsuyoshi-kun? What did you say about Fuka? What about Hayama?
Hayama!
Surgery? Where?
Fuka! Fuka! Are you alright?
Because of you, Fuka... Fuka is...
Hayama...
Sana, you came to see me?
Okay... thanks.
Is that so?
No worries! No worries! No worries! No Worries!
About Hayama...
Tomorrow we start with scene six
Actually...
I think I know that...
So I thought of many alternatives.
I've mentioned Octopus head, Wordy mouth yesterday...
That devil line is the most important line in the story!
Everyone, what would you like for lunch?
Can't you ever show up at the right time?
Shut up! You don't understand how I feel!
No way! Sana-chan!
Naozumi,
Riho... san...
That's right, shadows.
That's right, I saw the brilliance emanating from you.
was to train you into a true actor.
What? Sana-chan was forced to resign?
Hayama-kun...
Wait a sec, Akito-kun!
Bye.
No.
Run!
Don't mind it.
No, no, not at all. It's a fairly simple one.
Or because you're my boyfriend?
"Kodomo no Omocha"
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
it's time to get out of there!
in order to promote "Child's Toy"!
"My Boyfriend Has To Grin and Bear It"
an8"Rei-kun, why were you looking away?"
Fidget, fidget...
This is the train.
Asako-san wouldn't fall for that showy actor, after all, right? Right? Right?
He looks like a dangerous man.
Sana-chan!?
You look silly right now.
Like that!
and until the day when I become a full-fledged manager...
Until then... until then...
Rei-kun is being pretty wussy today.
No there's not!
Are you okay, Sana-chan?
Sana-chan...
Yeah. This drama is a very important job to her as an actress.
I'm just not seeing her so that she can concentrate on her work.
Right now, you're going to retrain yourself from the beginning!
Sana-chan? It's been too long! Sorry, but I'm out on location right now.
Asako-chan, hurry!
I- it can't be...
He told you himself not to worry about it, didn't he?
but Asako-san hasn't seen Rei-kun at all. Takuya-kun sees her every day on location!
Tsuyoshi-kun, you're a fan of Asako-san, huh?
Is that right?
They're closing in. Over.
Hey, what are they talking about!?
And if I can't get agitated over something like that-
Okay!
Do you usually use a chop on girls!?
That's acting suspicious if I ever saw it!
No, Sana-chan, you can't yell like that.
 Forbidden love, lu-lu-lu-lu. 
For you, I would gather the stardust from the night sky,
No, there's only one thing that I want.
This lecture has been going on since yesterday. That's not harping on it?
Yes...
she loves him because she's kissing him?
The two of them are leaving the restaurant. Over.
No you don't! Even if those two really are seeing each other,
Never mind that, just dance! Over!
Nothing tasty to see here, you say? Don't be ridiculous.
For you, I would gather the stardust from the night sky,
No, there's only one thing that I want.
To see myself reflected in your eyes. That's all.
but I don't want to see you in any kissing scenes!

Akito.
Akito.
That doesn't make any sense.
This drama is the brainchild of Mizoguchi sensei
What a pity.
I heard Hayama-kun being called a demon.
Oh, I forgot...
We're off, sensei.
Idiot?
Didn't I just say I'm here?
About what I said yesterday...
Hey Akito.
There's cake under the table and sweet potatoes.
Didn't I tell you to be careful?
Uh, about tomorrow...
Is that so?
We know there must be some misunderstanding.
Then please don't bring this subject up in the interview.
Proud... I'd rather say I feel responsible.
Our magazine has to watch our bottom line.
So we have to look after our readers' interests.
Akito's not bad.
I keep hurting Fuka.
Marathon. Once around Tokyo.
What's wrong?
Don't you do that too? You keep giving people nicknames like Peggy.
Huh?
Hey Sagami.
What a pain for you.
Oh, not at all...
Dammit, why does everybody blame Sana-chan?
He's hooked!
For Sana-chan's reputation.
About Sana-chan...
Manager and driver, Rei-kun
The reason why Sana-chan couldn't say devil is because of a guy named...
Kurata Sana spits at the American staff?!
Not this either!
Tell me, Rei-kun!
A child doing something before she plays...
But may be students who believe in the tabloids and be suspicious of Sana.
Sana will be alright.
Ah - Sana-chan...
But let's ask her the truth. May be we should ask Sana-chan.
Yeah.
I see.
Hey Sana-chan, is it true that you spat in America?
Yeah, I didn't believe you would do such a thing.
you suddenly sit
Uh.
The idol is here.
These days the school's image is getting worse.
An attitude that you will be listening attentively to the lessons.
Ok so open your books to page 87. Today we'll talk about photosynthesis.
Huh what is that smell?
Well, I deserve what I get!
It's alphabet!
Fuka...
oh everyone, thank you very much.
Good afternoon.
Hey everyone, I have something to tell you.
Sana-chan you're off topic!
every time there's a misunderstanding. I think this time it's the same thing.
Huh suspension. Akito... for me...
The one who was frustrated the most because he couldn't protect Fuka is...
He... Sana-chan...
Sana-chan is back, everyone is together again right?
Is it Matsui-san?
Did something happen to him?
Good morning.
Why didn't you tell me?
So I'll see you later.
...and so we decided that Fuka-san's injury was an accident.
then this would never have happened.
No, that's alright.
This is the true.
The one person you have to e nice to is not me...
Yeah.
Looks like it's gonna turn out well.
Naozumi-kun, where did you hear that?
That's wrong! You're wrong Naozumi-kun!
Naozumi-kun...
In America it feels like Texas
You will be feeling fine
I am Ultra Relaxed!
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
With everyone together saying
Simply singing for a relax
Naozumi-kun...
I don't get it!!
Why? Well I think it's because here is the classroom.
Hayama was suspended.
Fuka-chan was in the hospital.
I have to be really serious, huh... what is this really.
What's up with Hayama?
...a 'joudan' joke right?
I guess the more you fight, the more you guys get along.
I can't believe you really don't get it!
I'm not having it this year.
No... thing.
I feel like a worm inside a mouse ear.
I dunno why Naozumi-kun said that kind of thing so suddenly.
because my daughter is so dense, she gave you a hard time.
Oh really?
We're having such a painful time!!
What is this, adults crying just because it's Christmas?
...that I really still do love Hayama?
I thought I had forgotten Hayama completely
Mom said that cake should be from the Africa Maemae Cafe in front of station.
since it's my birthday that day.
Then I guess that's a no.
Yeah, on Christmas Eve I want to have a lot of fun!
I'm glad. I thought that it would be so sad to all be separated.
I wanted to sing and dance with you guys. And presents too!
Yes, yes, Dad wanted to ask about that too.
I see.
But it's mean, this magazine is saying whatever they want.
Suddenly dropping out of the drama, that's so unlike her...
Christmas Eve Day
I'm serious about it.
Oh well!
Hayama-kun, the real reason Sana-chan wasn't in the drama,
Congratulations.
Go.
so she was dropped out of the drama
Last year everyone was here.
Hayama was here.
a snowman isn't it?
I love Hayama after all.
Ah? Could it be a date?
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
Then you'll pull away!
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
Simply singing for a relax
I acted like an idiot.
Natsumi, your dad, a long time ago, was...
you hide that storage room where if 100 people went in it could collapsed.
Natsumi, dad was a Mad Scientist.
Only that much, you should have just bought it!
Let me see... Asatu store... I found it...
justice for us ajunior high school first year student?
The giant robot is made by Mr. Hayama.
It's name is Mecha Hayama Mama.
The robot is destroying cars and houses.
there's no second one
And in the aquarium there, they have goldfish that know how to smile.
The goldfish that know how to smile look like this
No matter how hard you think, you won't come up with any good ideas.
Have it broken?
Sana looks like she didn't get her
She hasn't changed a bit yet.
It's working, it's working
See, it's working.
I'm an idiot, and stupid, I'm sorry.
Oh, sorry about that
Hayama...
Where's Akito-kun?
Call me sister
Good morning, Sana.
Mama, why did you turn into a clock?
What a strange world!
You didn't do a good job as a manager
Oh, somebody's here.
You're still worrying about lunch?
Grandpa turned into a salmon.
I'm not sure.
Anybody here?
Hey, I'm prince
But... there was an old lady who knew magic
That's why I put a spell on everybody.
He's crying now
Sana, think carefully,
I stole it from the wrinkly old lady
be a twelve-year-old female, a first yearjunior high school student,
Of course I have to think first.
I don't want to! I don't want to kiss a toilet seat.
Thinking you're so cute and energetic.
When I realized Sana-chan had to kiss me, I couldn't help but feel excited.
Can't stand it. Can't stand it
Hello, is this star magazine?
There have way unrolled spell in the book
Now what should we do?
I'm always relaxed
It's a different now
Eh? Realistic?
Onda! It's finished.
Blue sky... Green sea...
Beautiful madam...
What do you think? My realistic wish...
Sana-chan hurry up and make a wish
Daifukumochi a sweet dumpling with bean paste in it
I have to repeat a year, it would be really embarrassing
Well, Sana has always been lucky in terms of work.
Being so serous in games isn't going to work.
Because Sana-chan got banned by the media...
...All the other news got mashed together. Oh! Presents from Hawaii!
If Sana-chan hears this...
In order to do that I can't stay this way
London?
Thanks for having me over
But I didn't think I would slip... Hahaha
Haven't seen you on TVfor a while. It feels like something is missing.
Sana-chan, help me!
Then it's nearly impossible to find.
The dog is a saluki
Rei-kun, what do you think the initials F.C. stand for?
How memorable! Do you remember this Rei-kun?
Where did you get this stuff from?
You even recorded the news
...and are quitting show biz, we're really upset.
But Sana-chan was really busy before...
Soon there will be tons of letters coming
Sana-chan.
I've been thinking about it since
But still, the story was not coherent
It's too late to say this now
In other words, they're educational videos.
An old friend asked me to talk to you
Then, what will my part be?
Sorry, but that's impossible. God hasn't given me any brain cells for math
Catch!
Thank you so much for helping me
Wait a second... wait a second...
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
When you're calm you always get a shock
You will be feeling fine
I'm always relaxed
It's a different now
It's the beginning of the semester.
Could it possibly be Akito told her his feelings?
You're late, Sand-chan!
Sorry, I have work now so
This...
I am the director Karesusukibara.
Nice to meet you.
Yes
You have an uneasy look in your face
and I was filming even before color films.
What's said after understand...
Ok.
I wonder what 22 is.
Ok, let's start from the short parts.
Trapezoid and Parallelogram. She read that as that,
Sana-chan, why!
Yeah one light won't do much good
because we don't have money.
It's be alright with this one right?
I wonder what happened... Sana-chan's gloomy.
No, it's not a LITTLE.
I understand,
I caused so much trouble.
I don't have to do math.
watching Hayama and Fuka went out at that time.
You always try to do everything by yourself
Onda, write it for me.
Anybody else?
So there is another person, but I wonder if she will do it.
Leave it to me!
So with today and tomorrow,
I'm gonna say this in advance, but I'm a strict teacher.
Thank you because I am a weakling who can't even do multiplication.
We're in 7th grade,
That means we must use math to drive a hard bargain in everyday life.
Fuka-san!
With our shocking meeting in the bathroom on the first day ofjunior high
So 4  and 7 4 is...
Easy easy!
why we have to learn this kind of lousy thing.
Sana-chan
Mizoguchi-san took most of Fuka's and my ideas.
And our video subject really changed.
Yes, sensei!
Ah Sana-chan, good work.
Oh, this!
What? From Kurata Sana?
the real Kurata Sana is me.
I am Ultra Relaxed!
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
Larger! Exactly!
I'm Kurata Sana, First year Middle School student.
Having the same name is not a only
Moveies and the Broadway show were successful
Because of my hard work.
You're not thinking clearly either...
For me? Who could it be?
Hello? I'm the director Ono.
Fax?
I'll ve very glad even if there's only a small role available.
To tell you the truth, about Sana-chan...
I'm director Ono, I'm risking my life.
I will try best. I will eat as much ramen noodles as I can.
We were still serried about that other time when the media blacklisted you.
Just hearing the rumors, one would think the fake
She goes on TVfor promotions every day, never a moment of rest.
The shooting of the tape is also successful. Easy, easy.
Sorry about that.
In all my 46 years of being a cameraman,
But instead you didn't complain.
I don't deserve all of your compliments.
I'm the real one.
Whose concert?
My daughter's concert
You can't possibly be in a non-working mood right now.
That fake Onda is probably better than the real one.
Everyone's inside. We should go too.
Really?
That is...
Sana-chan, you want to go home, right?
Me... I was hired by someone.
Shaved head...
We spread rumors and other things.
The Sana-chan is our hearts isn't like that.
...you punk.
The real Sana-chan is very good.
This way, kids who can't go to school can
So that's why.
Then you'll pull away!
I'm great and matchless when I'm relaxed!
Simply singing for a relax
Looks like you're in a pretty good mood, did you get a love letter?
This is the old way of saying love letter.
Not really, anyone can teach math.
Sana is really talented.
The chance to see her at school will decrease.
But...
Excuse me...
Rei-kun!
Who else? You guys are blocking my way. Get away.
I am an official worker.
Are you saying that our Japanese isn't correct?
Let's listen to the tape he gave us last week again.
I don't fit this kind ofjob.
If you don't do it... how you deal with rent and food?
You can say it like that. But it's not completely like that.
Prince... I will die if I keep going like this.
That's ok, don't worry about not having ajob.
We will do what you expect.
What?!
Shit. What are you doing?
Of course we can.
If Tsu-san will help us?
Sana's non-seductive seduction as an attack plan.
We only have the path of death if you don't help us.
Thank you, Tsu-san.
Proposal?
Sana? Please wait a second.
Proposal?
It's daylight!
I should say thanks to you
I only have a little bit left.
Cluck, cluck, cluck.
You got the answer, you are so smart.
Really? The cover is red because we want it to look special.
Alright already.
What kind of proposals are these?
Who is this big-shot old man?
Umm...
I will not give up!
This is the proposal that means life or death for me.
...who makes people feel she is a sparking girl.
Sana-chan, it's getting heavy, are you done yet?
I'm Kurata Sana, first, year middle school student!
Last year, between them...
I'm so nervous!
I see. I see.
And both of them were drawn!
That's alright! I can just go with Aya-chan!
The Valentine Event would be an excellent chance for people haven't love.
Shouldn't have brought it up...
Valentine? Is it on February 14th?
Used to be Kodomo no Omocha, now simplified as Kodocha!
You going? To the Valentine Event?
Hmmm? Chocolate...
Don't take him away...
That's good. That guy always sits idle and enjoys the results of others' work.
It's basically about
There, there.
No way, they're ignoring us.
Fuka and Aayama are probably here, too.
Wait a minute Takaishi!
It'd be troublesome if she hooked me.
What are you doing with this kind of girl without Fuka being here!?
It's more of your... business!
Aya-chan is MY girlfriend!
Please wait a second, If you haven't anything, please stand back.
So, in other words, you thought Hayama was cheating on his girlfriend.
Ykkes! It really is Sumira-chan!
On Valentine's Day, the separated lovers
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
When you're calm you always get a shock
I'm always relaxed
It's a different now
Kodocha is getting some very good reviews!
However, being both an actress and a student must be very hard.
If you miss any schoolwork...
Can really get on that show?
...you will be very busy again.
I know, don't worry.
Ah well, then please return quickly.
They could go to London on study trips.
What are all these random phone calls when I'm busy!
It's work first, right now.
You're not going to be just a guest star, but the sidekick to the show host!
The original sidekick is going to be married, that's why.
LESTEN TO ME!! 1
The topic will be the author's family.
This is very normal. They do this to introduce popular authors to the world.
The time is at 4 pm, does it interfere with your schedule?
Let's do it that way hmm, what sort of hairstyle should I have...
that phrase that I have tried to forget...
bye bye.
This is Asako-san's apartment.
What are you talking about?
I bought these to celebrate our new life in London
You...
Don't you want to come with me?
It's not of my hands.
Yes, after, we arrive in London we should live in a hotel first.
And then look around for a house, how's that?
Oh, he's on the fourth floor.
At that time... New year's Eve...
The feel of this apartment will be like this...
So you won't even call me? Idiot.
Asako, have you already left...?
I've really heard enough about Takaishi-kun and Fuka's relationship.
When we're photographed, I want the bookcase to be in the background.
This the airport.
It was so hard for me to become a member of a family again.
Hey, man, where ware you going?
Is this how you rally feel. Asako?
Even thought I told him I would wait for him.
...our love for each other is stronger than most
Rei...
Could we please wait a little longer?
Here is the female star Asako-san talking with an unknown gentleman...
It doesn't matter, however many times we do that.
What an idiot!
it's time lo gel out of there!
who's also active as an entertainer.
as well as my boyfriend and pimp!
I lose.
They're pretty incredible, all right.
Really? Really...?
All right...
You can't disobey me!
Don't get too pleased with yourself.
What are you doing!?
Hayama-san...
Sensei, geez, what are you doing crying?
No, no, scales fawl from your eyes, don't they?
That's good to hear.
Hayama! You broke your promise, didn't you!?
H- Hayama...
Akito-kun, are you all right?
I'm not proud to say this, but I'm not very good at defense.
Hey.
an8"'Grrrr...' Lone Boy"
What's that?
I could play the lead role in a crime drama!
What a performer! Look, it's Sana-chan, all right!
Wow, you're as cute as you are on TV!
Sana-chan doesn't want anything from the likes of you!
And what are you doing here, anyway!?
Aren't I always telling you not to come home until my bedtime!?
I've started feeling sorry for him...
Pink, strong tea, and the reverse choke-hold.
--Okay. --You couldn't catch me in a hundred years!
 that there were really families who were that cold to each other... 
 is fun, happy, and enjoyable! 
You're such an idiot, Tsuyoshi!
You're overdoing the laughing. Cut it out.
I don't have a father, though.
There must be something going on inside that house.
I've been wailing for an answer.
lo always go along with the scenario.
And our usual classroom...
so BOY, lake a look my way!
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
of the Light a Lantern, and Move On From Being Gloomy and Complaining Saga:
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
I always feel Relax,
Well then, just leave it alone- Gah! What? All of a sudden UFOs are shooting at me!?
Why should that kid and Sana-chan have to be in love-love, anyhow?
You can go now...
an8"Ah, that was scary"
an8"The Yellow Letter Co."
That's not true! That is genuinely Kurata Sana!
but I am definitely going to get my scoop, Kurata Sana.
 Out of the way! Watch out! I got caught on one of you! 
Free entertainment reporter?
I'm not going to answer a single question of yours!
That's a bunch of nonsense, right?
Well, I haven't really thought about it.
He's an unbelievable snake reportuh.
You're kidding!
When I'm happy, my sunglasses fall down.
I just got a little careless.
and before I realized it, it was 8:30!
There is, isn't there? If it isn't Kamura-kun, then who? Hayama-kun?
I'm going on ahead!
an8"And so..."
Let's go to work, Rei-kun!
Hey, it's so dark, it's not turning out.
That's odd...
The office just got a message for you from Sagami-san.
What a coincidence!
It's no coincidence. Sunglasses-sewn called me here.
Then it is a coincidence! Rei-kun called me out here, too!
Oh, excuse the late introduction. I am-
Kurosaki-san, what you are doing may not be against any laws,
Hayama-kun is not a performer. His situation is not the same as Kamura-kun's.
Which kind of stomach medicine do you take, pills or granules?
You...
You don't have to stoop to this rotten sort of work.
Waugh! Something's passing over me!
Sensei...
What do we do? Hayama is going to be dragged into this.
That tears it!
Right here!
It disgusts me, but just think of it as being bitten by a snake, and get past it.
I just can't do that! It's wrong, any way I think about it!
an8"Kurosaki Toshizo Shoko Tatsuya"
You dummy! Those are your underpants!
Sister, what about supper?
I'm the one who thought it was a dishrag, and handed it to him.
Don't kid around when it comes to the shape of his dorsal plates.
Oh, yes we do!
Were you trying to cajole the children into appealing for my sympathy?
You are so crooked! All you ever look into is the seedy side of people,
so you've lost the ability to look at things for what they really are!
But will you at least let me say this much?
Hey, Pop, make the underside of the tail slightly more pale. Don't disrespect it.
It's a picture of Sana-chan!
No, you can't have that one...
Pop, get painting!
Those two youngsters...
In dire straits,
to always go along with the scenario.
And our usual classroom...
Dad! Mom! Sister! Be strong!
I am Kurata San, 1st year Jinbou Junior High School student.
Say farewell to your pains and sorrows, welcome your new life!
But...
Sama-chan's mother, Misako's ex-husband!
The ominous shape is floating with the smoke...
Lend me some money! You have to return the money you borrowed!
It's mama's ex-husband.
Here's a hundred thousand yen.
Shimura-san, no need to be formal.
100,000 yen, you'll never get it back again!
I don't really want to care...
Nothing good comes out of helping that guy.
Are you saying that we should just watch him trick 100,000 yen off my mama?
The trailing continues.
Who's the guys with the rooster haircut?
Here's 100,000, I'll give you all of this if you stop hanging around Makoto-kun.
HURRY UP and SAY IT!!
WITH Moakoto-kun?
He doesn't wear earrings either.
Really?
We're on the 'pirate ship' already anyway.
Sana-chan and her manager are so worried.
But, I thought if we had 3 people living together, everything would be alright...
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it aright too?
Zenjirou-san hasn't noticed, so let's get on with the show.
Come out, the youths inside!
This is a very common thing.
I hear form Uncle that Kurata Sana is like his daughter.
The worst thing you've done is...
But then he gave it back...
What's going on?
What's wrong?
I'm Babbit.
Old lady, you're right.
Actually, he is a gigolo.
This has nothing to do with you...
That gigolo Ryousuke is this serious...
Your mother is thinking of marrying...
Oh, mom said that Ryousuke-san is a rare, good person.
Why didn't you two say anything?
His favorite dish is meat and potatoes.
So that's why she was making meat and potatoes.
She always gets dumped in the end.
Miyoko-san might be coming in just a second.
I didn't think he was such a cold person.,
It doesn't matte, as long as I'm with you, mom.
That's right. I'm heartbroken. Why don't you comfort me?
Misako...
Then you'll pull away!
Larger! Exactly! Even shining heads go pir pir!
My, friend, Hayama Akito.
Hmmm... I'll turn off the alarm clock... heh heh heh.
Go ahead and oversleep.
Gosh, Akito! You don't need to be so suspicious!
Sana-chan...!
Who in the world wants to be Natsumi's boyfriend?
Since I don't have any scissors, I'll tear it apart.
Sorry, can't tell ya.
Fine then. I think I was hit by something...
I won't tell what hit you either.
Hey, that's...
Let's go home Time's gone when you two were staring at each other.
Why don't you turn on the lights?
You're kidding me!
Who's the other guy?
Oh., yeah, Sana-chan! Wanna your dinner?
then it's decided. Let's go, Akito.
Umm... Valentine, is it?
Natsumi's boyfriend Of course a father will be concerned about that.
Wait! You happy little thing!
Mr. Hayama gave me work to do!
Beneath the sky of Paris! Bye the riverside today!
How did you know?
Does Akito know about this?
Yes, are you done with your business?
Well...
Akito, you're home!
Sister's boyfriend I don't know what to say!
You're thinking about something.
That is...
What are you talking about, dad?
I've decided to think about it that way.
We're only high school students, and besides we've only started dating.
First check Natsumi's schedule, then have a showdown at their date.
Ah, wait. Don't move.
He even sat next to her!
Hey you, it's no time to smile like that.
We didn't...
How about next Sunday?
It's already over, snepai.
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
And best friend, Hayama Akito.
Uh, as you have seen just now,
the different boiling points... of the substances.
Over there, are you listening to the lesson, Hayama?
Now, I will give out the solution for the experiment...
At lunch time!
I didn't...
Ohhh. What, what's right Ohhh?
I did not hit him.
But that Hayama says that he did not hit anyone.
Hayama...
Hayama, you've changed...
there no limit to it.
The gymnastics team?
...but my hands are full with the Swim Team and the Astronomy Club...
Sensei, you know you can't use that way to solicit for a club.
Me, Karate?
and it's not suited for Tsuoshi-kun!
Alright, there you go,
...the end of the century will be ruled by karate, well?
I'll think abut it.
Yah!
It's alright.
Bye. Thank you very much, Sensei!
That's corny.
Sengoku-sensei is against karate?
so let's not waste time and do some stretching.
Karate club karate club karate...
Wow, Fuka.
Yeah, that's a weird combination, Sana
Sana, a while ago I hear Sengoku-sensei and Suzuki-sensei talking to each other
If don't be careful and make little wrong now,
Not just for Hayama, but for myself too.
Finished...
Hey wait, can we have a toast to raise the mood?
Sorry, next time I'll be okay.
To be frankly, it's me, Sana-chan's birthday of 13 years old.
Wow wow Sana-chan! Congratulations, congratulations!!!
What? Curry again? I wanna eat ramen.
Then you'll pull away!
With everyone together saying Bababababa!
Larger! Exactly! Even shining heads go pir pir!
My best friend, Hayama Akito Karate Club?
Hey you... are you interested in Karate
I just was too excited after yesterday's school activity.
I wonder why Sengoku-sensei and Hayam-kun have such a bad relationship.
Oh yeah, where are you going? You have to sleep!
good morning! Good morning!
I'm sorry being out of school yesterday.
Hey nosebleed did you see the notebook?
so I asked him to.
What do you mean by that! Exactly what it means!
Observe him for a while and give him one more chance, okay?
He didn't look cool when he was practicing.
we want pizza!
Sana-chan you weren't nichoku for a long time so you're happy aren't you?
So other classroom's erasers missed?
Now erasers are the precious treasure in school.
Ok Hayama, dance!
Damnit is this good enough.
Hey you... What is it?
Good morning. Good morning.
Um... it's embarrassing when we realized that Shouta wasn't home,
His health is not so strong. So he made up a goal that he would never be absent
An after school activity? Yeah. He started Karate or something.
Did you just say Karate? Eh? Yeah...
How long can you be so optimistic? A member of the Karate Club, Nakao is...
Reason? That quiet Nakao joined the Karate club
Nakao!
Now I could definitely get Hayama away from this school.
but he was hard working, right Hayama? Yeah.
Principal, this is Nakao's letter to me, please read it.
He... he didn't want to quit? Hayama.
Today and yesterday we have a lot of free time
I broke that record by myself,
and I was so sad. My precious no absence record has been destroyed
and I was forced to quit Karate Club. I have nothing left for myself.
I'm thinking about my work too but I'm sure stolid.
Nakao Shouta did not come home since yesterday.
It sounded like it was definite that it was all Akito-kun's fault.
I heard that kid Nakao ran away because of Hayama's torturous training.
Although I wasn't Jinbo Elementary School, 6th grade class 3, I'm sana's friend
Yeah he was more concerned about his conduct grade. That's right.
Where you going Hayama?
See?
I... this is what I am.
You're thinking that and because of him... what am I thinking
Think! Just think!
What the hell was that...
I'm in charge of the chalkboard erasers so I know.
While you were doing unneeded movements
It's no use, we can't get in father,
Are you alright? Nakao-kun?
Nakao! Hayama, I'll go get Suzuki-sensei! Yes.
I'm gonna become a mummy.
What now?
Even if I go out, there's nothing for me out there.
What are you saying? Because I never helped out anyone.
But nobody came after all,
We only live for around 13 cubic meters. You're comparing different measure
When I was in the karate club, I was really happy.
Hayama-kun disappeared? Yeah
Hayama who wanted to make a Karate Club badly took out Nakao-kun
Hayama, bad, Nakao seems lost sense.
and if we keep it, we will become mummy.
if the head comes out, the body will come out too.
I...
Nakao!
In America it feels like Texas
When you're calm you always get a shock
Akito-kun! Sana-chan!
I failed... I see
I failed...
I see, I'm glad
I'm really sorry, from the start I have laid my eyes on Hayama Akito's
dangers.
You don't have to apologize. But now the school must decide on his expelling
Mr. Hayama, I assume Akito was concerned about Nakao-kun's health
Ahh Yousaki-sensei, our first period is Sengoku sensei's so
I'll go tell everyone!
Um...
I'm dead but, no. Why did I die
I want to do it with Hayama-kun!
Since Nakao has that letter, Hayama-san is in trouble now
Are you sure you're alright? Answer me.
I haven't chance to answer you. Don't think it is easy.
But by listening to Nakao's words,
When you question that if I was in your class I
thought that I was not a living being.
Do I have a meaning in life? I was always thinking about that.
Why did I have to find it?!
"Zenjiro's "Child's Toy""
Oh, she's gone.
"Breakfast with Sana and Mama."
But your mother is not so open-minded...
About today, you remember that we have a live broadcast of "Child's Toy," right?
We're already 30 minutes late!
It looks like you must have eaten something wrong again today,
And while you're at it, tell the other boys to stop doing this, too!
Sensei! Here, here, here! I don't understand this at all here!
Don't sniffle-sniffle, I tell you.
Three days ago, and the day before yesterday, and yesterday, and today,
Ah, I always watch it. I'll be pulling for you, okay?
"Zenjiro's "Child's Toy""
Does anyone have any eye-poppingly good looking teach-uhs?
Isn't that nice? Nothing but new stuff for awl you youngst-uhs.
"Hazardousurvival?"
Every single day in our class,
and even tigers howl!
That's no school!
And it's him! It's all his fault! Him! Him!
Hayama Akito, of the 6th grade, 3rd Class at Shinbo Elementary School!
That was a load off! Right now, I feel like you do
...you poop it aIl out! I feel terrific!
He's just a big sissy, with shriveled-up nards!
Mama is just stating the possibility.
Are you sure you're okay by yourself? Should I walk you to your classroom?
What's up?
Ah! They're here!
You guys make monkeys look smart!
Damn it!
Next time, ask an adult near you what she means!
The ratings would go up unexpectedly!
The sunsets in Hawaii are romantic!
The name of Kurata Sana would ring throughout the world
Oh, Kurata!
"We'll do it after school."
Are you running away?
Hold it, Hayama!
iHuh?i
You're the first one who's ever been able to stand up to him!
Fire!!
Remember earlier?
Hayama, the devil! The devil's boy! Go back to the land of devils!
That image just now makes me out to be the cobra, doesn't it?
Gag me.
You keep out of this, you homo!
This will be the first time I've ever hit a girl.
At this point, we're going to have a private talk. You come with me.
You're not all that stupid, so why is it that you do nothing but stupid things?
Search me. Maybe because I am stupid.
What exactly is it that you don't like!?
Sana-ichani?
Oh, I can do that, huh?
In that case, I'll show you what true terror is!
Hayama's weak spot?
Take your seats!
What are you doing, you perverts!?
They got me. How could I let this happen?
--I can't be late for it! --Eh? In that case, I'm feeling like opening up less and less.
Was there really such a program!?
I'll just borrow these, wash them and return them later.
A tornado!
You want something like what happened to Mami to happen to you?
She's still home from school over the shock she received in the pond.
Rei-ikun...i
It's my fault for bringing her here late,
--And she's the heroine. --How could he do this...?
I challenge you to a bungee jump contest, Hayama!
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
I always feel Relax,
The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
Not to worry!
What, Mom?
I'm worried about them giving you a hard time at school.
Mom...
Not really.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you mean the news yesterday, by any chance?
...long, brown hair...
You dumbass! What did you do to your head!?
Um... um... um...
Heh heh, I'm surprised you even came.
After what happened to your old man!
I'd better erase it, huh?
Arrested, of all things... Why would he do such a thing...?
Sasaki-san sure is having it rough.
That's not somewhat similar, that's exactly similar!
I'll be right there!
I've had enough of this.
Let me have them. You can give him gifts, so I'll give them to him for you.
Did you see your dad?
What?
Y- you know...
But I'm worried, worried about Tsuyoshi-kun,
You can't do that!"
Anyhow, divorce is a situation between adults, right?
the kids are still kids, and the mom is still the mom.
You've got some pocket change, right?
Look, just hand it over.
 They're good with honey syrup poured on them! 
 They're also good with ice cream on top! 
 Now I really want to eat some! 
 Han-pan-pa-pan! Clap to the rhythm! 
Like she was in a daze...
Why should I have to go pick up that bald old codger?
Your mom was thinking about it all last night.
It's Tsuyoshi-kun!
Father Oki, why are you ignoring him?
...going to go bald in the future, huh?
He will not go bald!
Yes. He. Will.
Hmm...
I've been waiting for an answer.
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
There is a deep, troubling gap between the boys and girls.
The boys and girls of 6th Grade 3rd Class have split the classroom in half,
Love Tastes Like Curry
"Class is over..."
Eh!? Fear of heights!?
It's no use trying to escape. Prepare yourself!
I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm as happy as I've ever bean!
What's with that anxious look on your face--?
Please! It isn't ready! It isn't ready! It isn't ready!
You're serious about doing this?
Oh, dear! You nervous? Or are you a "baby?"
I beg your pardon...
Hayama-isani!
Sensei, is your manuscript ready?
? Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, ?
? what's going to happen at school? ?
I'm such an idiot.
Can't you look sharper!? Sharp--?
Picture?
and as it happens...
away from him?
Is that right? Well, why don'tcha tell me mo-ah about these make-out pitch-uhs,
And this is a Polaroid camera.
I think that's his older sister's voice.
iHayama...i
"After all, it's not like we can overlook everything else he's done up to now"
I don't want to become one.
It's the walkie-talkie that shakes, Burutcha!
"The monkey has left, but there's a new monkey!"
I don't have any more.
Fine with me.
Coming at a time when no one else was here
"So, did Hayama forgive him?"
Hmph! It serves him right!
Hayama-isan...i
Hmph. I'm not listening to what you say any more.
Starting today, I'm the boss!
I guess Gomi's reign only lasted for one period.
But still, violence is wrong.
but remember what he was doing up until recently!
Why do I have to go through something this painful!?
"Hayama"
Sensei! I can't wait for your manuscript any longer!
Just kidding! The truth is, I've already got it done!
? that there were really families who were that cold to each other... ?
? Being a lone wolf ?
What, do your serious scenes only go on for a few seconds!?
You called the teacher "Mother"!
Tsuyoshi really does have a mother's complex!
I have! She looks funny! She has the same face as he does!
"Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you very much!"
I knew.
And, you know,
"Hayama, all alone"
iHuh?i
Good morning-
Okay then, please open to page 48 in the textbook-
Ghastly!
iGleam!i
That's all right- As long as you don't run wild in the classroom
everything is completely okay, and naturally daff-ay-
make it somebody who can actually play soccer-
let's do something about it, and make things more pleasant-
You know there's no way I can do that! Why would you even say such a thing!?
Go ahead and smash your head in with the edge of a block of tofu or something!
Never!
You couldn't understand the way I feel!
Sana, are you sure you're not feeling out of sorts?
You'd better sit down for this! Ta-da!
Don't do it!
Let's go home-
Uh, nothing, never mind-
"Feeling out of sorts, Sana is troubled"
Everything is your fault!
Now, you're not the teach-uh, how come you're running things?
Hey, there, how is the grouch today?
Because of that, it's always been like this for you at home?
Sana-ichani!
But it turns out that the setting for this drama
Maybe I'm shameless, and maybe I'm a buttinski,
All right!
i...panic!!i
Huh? I've got a funny feeling about what's going to happen---
You could always show up normally-
I told him that wasn't the case, but---
Today, you start shooting that drama, right?
Yes, she is! Her manuscript is three days late, after all-
Mama, you stick to it, as well!
? I swore it to the setting sun, ?
That's strange-
U- um--- K- Kurata Sana- It's nice to-- to have the occasion to meet you-
Yes, that goes for me, too!
Some new clothes? A bag? What do you want?
You demon child! If only you had never been born---!
I'll be right there-
and then he became the lonely wolf!
Devil---?
Kurumi-isani!
Natsumi---
I'll do my best in this drama! So you do your best, too!
? You better not miss it! ?
My father? He's at work today, and I don't think he will be back until late-
Dum-dum?
I dunno- I've never watched anything together with them-
Listen, why don't I pretend like I'm your mother?
A-ichan---i
"The mother game keeps going on"
I've--- I've--- been awful to Akito, quite truthfully-
I haven't caught anything! Leave me alone! I didn't catch any cold!
Your eyes-- they aren't the eyes of a grade-schooler, are they, Akito?
The truth is, I know--- but why now, after all this time---!?
iAsako...i
You're the devil!
but what about yourselves? You dummy father-and-daughter---

Really?
Porridge, for me?
That's right- Hot! It's the first time I've ever made any-
You didn't sleep?
That was probably--- a first---
I'm feeling so good right now, I'm going to be especially generous!
In exchange, you're not getting away tonight-
For whiter teeth to die for--
Eh, um, here! Here! The tips of these bristles are so firm!
You're going to be interviewed by Kurumi Asako!?
H- he can't be- He can't be, that's-- that just isn't---!
I think it's fine, whichever one you go with-
By any chance, do you not want to go to this interview!? That's it, isn't it!?
My stomach---!
And it's not that-
See, Mom was saying he was playing sick from the start-
or it won't be in time for printing--
He said he was going to wait in the car, so he's in the underground parking lot-
They say he's living together with his girlfriend-
but I thought that if he worked at it properly, he would look good-
Huh?
Wait, Rei!
? It's the height of absurdity, absurdity! ?
? Times of emergency are coming! ?

Okay!
Right now, we even have teachers making it with each other,
and it's the very picture of friendship and peace.
What happened?
You mean, my name is going to be heard all over the country?
And yet...
Is that what you think, Norio-san?
No, I wouldn't say I was lying...
That's right. People who are good at it should be the ones who do it.
I'm not wearing that! I want a wedding dress!
Hardhead! Anyhow, the girls are not cleaning!
What? What? What? You've got a problem with that?
Either way? It doesn't matter either way!?
And Kojima!
This is terrible. If this keeps up,
Okay, Sensei, let's get class started.
Guys, class is starting!
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Just how long will it take before this wall is gone?
-- Build a great nation, 
 And let the boys do the cleaning! 
Just what you see here. Any questions?
Wrinkled- wrinkled hag?
Limbo!
Clear!
Go ahead! Andoh-sensei, you're so angry all the time, it gives you more wrinkles!
Sensei, you can't let the boys get off easy on this.
You work it out with "guts"!
Principal, hurry, hurry!
Huh? Must have imagined it...
Japanese men live in houses with tatami mats!
Hey, boys! Don't throw your garbage away over here!
Your garbage came over here!
Garbage?
an8"Japan"
Let me handle this!
Why do boys hate to clean? That I do not know.
No matter how dirty you leave your room, or how little you clean up,
Mm-hmm.
To think we'd have to sneak around like this.
I've had enough of this, myself.
Special makeup!
Oh, that's the gulf between the boys and the girls.
A limbo dance tournament! Let's li-!
I hate losing.

I don't see you for a little while, and you develop a Lolita complex?
Show me your face!
Excuse me for showing my regular face-
Who are you talking to?
--No! --with soba and eggs-
I still have some glasses with eyes in them!
iAsako-san...i
When we were shooting that drama earlier, you would always wait in the car-
Why did you keep it a secret?
Don't worry about a thing-
But now, a woman from his past has come up- Makes me feel icky-
Why should I have to take that coming from you!?
he tried to put a curse on her, to kill her!
"Still---"
Whoa! When did you---!?
Say, you don't have a home, right? Come with me!
Mama, we're home! I brought one of those homeless guys

What's more, it's City Hall!
What!? Hey, you're making me feel all gross,
Listen up- You'll be writing essays about your impressions here,
Ah, I can see the school!
so if we wind ourselves up over little things,
I'm feeling great now! Refreshed! Invigorated! And plant!
Hayama!
I- I really meant for nothing bad to happen to you, see?
Uh, listen, they say that if you drink some cold juice,
It's going to get all sticky- Come on, hurry-
i...panic!!i
Please look forward to it- This has been Babbit, the white bat-
"Congratulations! Social Studies Field Trip"
It's your own fault for getting your face so close-
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you-
We'll be caught in the middle!
Sensei! Your manuscript, please!
iAsako-san---!i
Silence-
Why don't you take your Burutcha out of your pocket?
If your manuscript is late this time, I'll have to face the editor--!
? I don't get it! It's bothering me! I don't know what's going on! ?
? Who does get it? I don't know! ?
Strange, like she's been possessed by something-
Let me have one too, okay, okay, okay?
Stop criticizing and let's pull out of here, all right!?
You're kidding! Why this all of a sudden? Six commercials in one week?
She's not listening-
Sorry, I have to shoot a commercial today-
You don't need to overturn anything-
Yahoo!
Take 20, one more time!
What is the young lady thinking?
One more time, okay?
Two ice creams are i-ice-
Ah, I could do commercials like this over and over again! I can still eat more!
Yay! I can do as many as you like!
Butterflies and flowerbeds!
Babbit took all the leftover ice cream!
Ah! All done! All done!
ride out this energy you've got now, and do a bunch in one stretch-
That would give me the muscle tone of a squid-
Right!
Now, hold on!
Yes?
Yeah, me too-
Okay, I'll go home by myself- You guys take your time-
You scatterbrain!
Work has been hard on me-
"I don't hate it," he answered-
Pop, you're starting to act more and more like a father, huh?
Huh?
My pop might be dying-
Hayama---
Where's your sister?
Mm-hmm-
Hayama,
Your mother?
Make sure you keep any man that seems to have a crush on you-
Oh, manipulate men in the palm of my hand-
Yuck! I don't want this! How unlikable!
Amateur-
I oughtta say it's completely different-
and flutter your way into a new world-
Nice work, everyone-
Um, hello? About the commercial---
Hey, hey, steady now-
Oh, really? Your birthday?
--Mine's coming up real soon- --What do you want for a present?
We'll have to think about what to eat, huh?
No! This is a juice commercial, remember?
This is bad! This is bad! This is bad!
Is she thinking, "Is this the way I want to live my life?"

Elegant and revitalizing, even in the jungle!
I'll have to make sure---
Ah--- I'm exhausted---

and also played the tragic heroine, Juliet-"Oh, Romeo---"
Really? I'm so glad!

They're burying the hatchet already? How boring-

so it's a match-up that would only happen once,
They say they're even going to write a song just for Shorokutai to perform!
--"Nonchalant Zenjiro"! --for four hours on her.
What about Saori-chan, the ad campaign girl?
Lucky! Happy! Ka-ching!
Sure, as long as it's only one night.
Mayu-chan, don't let yourself be outdone by the other two.
Shorokutai, huh? Hmm...
Tomomi won't make any difference. She's no different from being a doll.
I'm Tsu, the producer. Now that all of our members have come together,
I guess.
You're all going to be working together, right?
I'm going to get the heroine role, no matter what!
Not this again. Sana-chan, they can't start unless you're there.
and Tomomi-chan their invitations.
Um, we once appeared in the same production together.
Is that right?
Do we make it Sana-chan?
What if Kurata-san were to play a dog?
We have another engagement, so if you'll excuse us...
an8"Shorokutai Special: New song, 'Vitamin Love' rehearsal"
Would you take this more seriously?
--it's going to embarrass us all, understand? --she's strict.
I told you not to fool around, didn't it?
Oh, where's the dog- Kurata-san?
And so, as Mayu-chan was thus feeling aggravated,
the final day of shooting arrived just like that!
Now then, today is the last day, right? I'll go get my dog costume!
Kurata-san is always positively-
an8"Tobita Mayu-sama Ayanohanamarukoji Tomomi-sama"
R- right! Right! You're absolutely right!
It's me, Sana.
Oh no, you really are upset at me?
Whoa, that's harsh.
but still, I had a lot of fun in Shorokutai. Totally.
All right! Now you have an excuse to go, don't you?
-- ...hip hop act! 
-- Sane-yan, your belly jiggles around.  --What is this?
Mm-hmm. Oh, is he planning to play his trumpet next?
 Oh, my! We are open to everyone!

"The Path to Being a Fantastic Manager" by Obana Miho
Which is why I thought we should go over to Tsuyoshi's house and see, right away-
I told you! I don't know, you miserable brat!
So that's the kind of dad he has, huh? I didn't know-
his dad looked kind of lonely-
It was right in front of my face-
Now I'll never find a husband, for sure!
This body--- This body has the future of the Kurata family hanging on it-
Hey!
Tsuyoshi, I ought to---
Once it's straightened up, come on over and see it-
"We"?
Right! "We"!

Your chick is on the veranda!
You're right-
There are all kinds of dads- Bald dads, fat dads,
What?
I'd like to start writing that essay about you and me-
Mama--- Mama--- might just hate me!
A-chan, about your Mama---
Besides, there's no way your mom could hate you-
"Ice"
All I know is that the title will be "My Daughter and I-"
"Pbbbt!" I'm not telling!
A terrible commotion---?
Hardtack!
Nothing? You said it was a story about me, didn't you?
Anyhow, everyone thinks that our home has gotten a little bit more enjoyable,
So, um, I'm just saying---
Oh! You're embarrassed!
Hey, Hayama, smile one more time!
But you just barely smiled, didn't you?
How cute! How cute! I know---!
So, tell me all about it in your room-
Gateball! Not this time, though-
--A boy? --I can't see, I can't see-
so that definitely means he's not a girl, huh?
and he's got eyes with pools in them that sparkle---
What's the matter, Akito?
--"Waugh! We've had it! --"Waugh! We've had it!

Let it pass, okay!? See? I'm begging you! Please, officer! Please, officer!
But Mama has written an essay about that, and it's about to go on sale-
Huh? It's being made into a book?
Did you think you had some kind of dirt on me!?
What were you planning to threaten me into doing!?
That's not it!
Well, I wouldn't say fan, exactly---

Yeah- That's probably why she doesn't answer-
In that case, I'm going home-
Whoa, just a minute- Let me strike a decent pose for awl of you-
She doesn't, does she?

"Exactly right!"
Yeah, like, really...
Are you done cleaning, Tsuyoshi-kun?
Yeah, the two of you!
Gomi-kun, you really do like gomi "trash", huh?
Okay, in that case, a spare tire for her indoor car,
She'll be in middle school next year, and she has more money than I do.
Okay, okay, ladies, thank you! Okay! Okay!
You know what? There's something we'd like you to teach us, Zenjiro-san.
Just a minute!
If he really likes that goil, then there's no problem, is there?
Aah! I'm so attractive, I can't stand it!
Hey, did you hear about Tsuyoshi-kun?
It wasn't...
I'm sorry!
Cheer up. Here.
together with Aya-chan!
"Sugita"
--Go tell her "good morning"! Come on, come on! --I can't... I couldn't...
and I've always thought that you're really great.
and fall for her, Tsuyoshi-kun, it's all right.
and give them to you as presents, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Which means... Tsuyoshi will never be able to escape from these cookies, huh?
so BOY, take a look my way!
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
She's my Grandma Shizuka, who runs a resort named Kurata Inn
As promised, we're going to the Kusatsu hot springs!
by relieving some of the tension?
--The press was at school, too- --and her "My Trivial Secrets" corner-
Huh? But---
If it is all right with you,
We blew it-
I'm so sorry I fell asleep!
Oh, I'm hearing Father Hayama from that direction---
Really, I still have the figure of a little girl-
"Three stars down there---"
There aren't very many photos of Hayama--- are there---?
--Your ass? --Bingo! --Bingo!
It's time for good little boys and girls to go to bed-
Nah-
I wonder why- I did have that nap, after all---
I'd like---
"Let's eat ramen" When are you going to wake up?
What if we disguise you?
We could do that, huh? Disguise, disguise, hmm-hmm-hmm---
I know! If it's a disguise we need, Hayama, get me a fake beard-
I don't have anything like that-
It's all right- You make a fine boy-
Hey, I hear that Zenjiro's new girlfriend is 2m 50cm tall-
--So, what about her weighing 4-5 tons? --What's was that?
I am going on a joiney too, on this elevatuh-
This is the one, right? I'll put it right here in the basket-
I found it!
It shua can-
"Sana and Hayama's ramen" Are you awake?
Done-
--See you- --Hayama---
you wouldn't do anything, right?
did you notice anything when you read the table of contents?
What?
And even if she is, she might not read this book-
I also--- have a few questions and things I want to ask her-
Kamura Academy--
I'm sure there are people who are less fortunate than I,
Naozumi! See here!
It really was surprising, you know?
"The birth mother is at a loss-"
Sensei, I brought Sana with me-
I asked him if he wouldn't mind staying behind myself,
Yeah, thankfully!
That doesn't even make sense!
--Oh, right, this is my good friend, Hayama- --Tea? All right-
Yes-
Right? Right?
Don't you have anything more important to ask?
Huh!? This is important! Up to now, it has always been the 7th of March-
Yeah, "Samu-"
Oh, I get it-"Sam-"
"Hayama's image of Sam" Hi! My name is Sam- Very thank you- And you?
This could be the first time-
Cut it out!
Ah, what are you doing!?
It's okay, isn't it?
I have a daughter--- who is almost 3-
Huh? Well, she is, right?
Y- yeah---
Yes?
"I am nawt Zenjiro" Ah, my back hoits--- ah, my back hoits---
You're right- Pick it up for her-
Undercover?
I could never think of you as my mother-
H- huh---?
Mama! I'm home!
Sana---
I'm so sorry-
Shall we rebuild, then?
Let's do it, Mama! Once the royalties from "My Daughter and I" come in,
There has been an outbreak of in-house traffic accidents!
What do you mean? That's old news! You know what? It's already been settled!
What's the matter, Hayama?
"Oh, Sam is very, very happy!"
Your daughtuh is named Tororo?
Let her have it!
But I'm wearing bloomers, so no problem! Come on by, anyone who wants to see them!
Hit his weak spot?
Oh, I can do that, huh?
Whatever, just take one! Hurry, hurry!
This is the white bat, Babbit, Babbit! Come on, come on!
Not really.
Lesson prep, review, homework party!
Hey!
What?
Okay!
Listen, proper sitting and cleaning are all part of the training.
I...
I'm no good...
Well, aren't you putting your back into it?
if you don't mind listening.
? I apologize more than Niagara falls. ?
? Sorry, noodles, forgive me, tea table. ?
...let her decide whether she wants to continue working, or to quit.
But she doesn't seem to have it under control.
That's right! I hate work! I hate it! I hate it! A hundred times, I hate it!
"Meanwhile, at the Hayama's house..." Yum!
Akito said "compliments to the chef"!? Aah!
I take full responsibility for this, and will deal with it,
Ah, they're so warm!
Oh, you couldn't ask us to do that...
I fell down.
Sorry about that.
What do you think?
That's when I... I wanted to start doing something, too.
He wanted something to do...?
Should we cry, too?
this early in the evening!? Oh, it's you!
What's more, it's because of something I said offhandedly!?
I always feel Relax,
No, I haven't.
 Flowers blossom even in the hot water! 
 Choina-sa no choina-sa no choina-sa no sa! 
thought of as the greatest reward.
Misako-san, it has been a while, huh?
What are you so excited about?
Are you sure it was really him who came here?
What if it was actually just a look-alike?
They all have no dreams, huh?
Let's see... Nothing in particular right now...
We welcome you!
Why is the Hayama Family here?
Is that right?
My children and I have taken her up on her offer. Here, have some more.
Oh, thank you.
You certainly have everything arranged.
I am not coming back!!
What are you doing?
I've never been skiing.
So you may say, Boss,
Just turn Kurata Inn entirely over to me, Kunisada Chukichi,
This is starting to sound like a period drama.
I spy three little stars!
Yeah. The Mistress is almost ready to give up.
When you think about it, you have to feel sorry for the Mistress.
are still in grade school.
Rei-kun, there's a chance that I might be relocating to Kusatsu.
an8"The Path to Becoming a Wonderful Head Clerk"
"Child's Toy Skiing Classroom"
Are you okay, Zenjiro-sensei?
 Kusatsu is such a nice place, come on by at least once! 
Yahoo!
Who are you?
Welcome back.
It appears that the Kunisada family intends at last to resort to violence.
Okay!
It's no use arguing! The Kunisada clan is taking over! You got that!?
...and Uchiyamada, too.
I shall avenge Zenjiro-sensei and Uchiyamada-kun! Defend yourselves!
"Zenjiro-isan"i
We Orange Teamers clobbered you!
Let's get together and have some fun again sometime.
are you sure it was okay for you to say that?
Oh, I can't, I'll be on location.
Babbit, tap-tap!
Mama, are you watching?
I'll be right there.
Sorry, but I didn't see it among the laundry on the shelves.
Lunch? Is that right? Where's my lunch?
It's waiting for you in the bus. Fried mackerel sandwiches.
Mama is...
It's dangerous here.
We have to look for her!
But I've got this feeling like I shouldn't be doing this.
It's long.
"I'm just a little bit hungry!"
Fish sausage!
I hear there's DHA and calcium in there!
I have to look for her! If we don't find her soon...!
There's still time!
Keiko-isani!
I left Mariko all alone, and went back inside the house.
No, it's me!
It was me!
All of you, bow your heads!
Mariko-ichani!
Mariko!
Um, could you circle around to the left next, please?
Still insisting on that, are you?
N- now what!?
It's coming out, coming out!
--We were careful about that, too... --Mariko is our reason for living.
It sounds like you're very happy.
You're alive and well, so you have to be happy!
Thank goodness you're safe!
Whoa! Kurata Sana's greatest weakness has been discovered!
"Even ogres can be moved to tears"
Sure.
If you had said you couldn't sign anything for some scary middle-school girls,
Naturally, you're coming up through our middle school, right?
Why are you laughing at everyone else's positive attitude towards life!?
--Okay, let's go, Hayama! We're going to think positive, --Huh, me too?
There's a bright, enjoyable middle-school life waiting ahead for us.
I've been hiding under the podium for a while.
Listen up, everyone!
"The test is in 3 days"
W- what does the principal have to say about this?
Be quiet!
For whatever I said, I really don't have the principal's permission to do this.
You know, sometimes it's necessary to tell a lie.
I'll help, too!
You don't understand?
? fifth grade math came falling down on me, ?
This is difficult for me to tell you...
What is it?
but I don't get math at all.
I have to study!
? --Decimals and fractions, fraction multiplication, ? --What's so bad about math?
? --and multiply them! ? --What's so bad about math?
? Distance divided by time, time times speed! ? --What's so bad about math? Whoo!
Hey...!
Everyone, calm down! A child who quarrels is a bad child!
W- what!? But you gave all the photos back, didn't you!?
Unless you want it to get out,
It's the truth.
You told me you didn't have any more make-out pictures, but you lied to me!
"Conspiracy-- an evil plan plotted in secret--" A conspiracy is an evil plan
Oh, it's just...
This is beyond serious!
Let go of me, would you!?
R- right! It's about the aptitude test!
W- well...
It really was hard on me.
I do indeed have the make-out picture right here.
Huh? They still say it now?
"Just in case...?"
What is everyone doing over there?
Oh, how pretty!
Really? Okay...
Oh, okay. If he drinks too much, he'll get the runs.
I forgot my jump rope! I'm going to go run back to the classroom.
No...
Would you go home without doing anything!?
Are you for sure coming to school tomorrow?
Isn't he cute?
You say that, and I'm going to grow huge!
Mami-ichan...i
It's not "bang," it's "basin."
Hello!
This is kind of fun, huh?
Hayama! What good will running away do!?
was something he absolutely should not have done.
But if you fawl, look, there's this cushion!
which means that if you fawl, you'll be awl right,
Yeah, I'm so pleased. Thank you.
...said that even if you don't know what scars a person has on their hearts,
With a trophy for returning spilled water to the basin!
"Let's draw pictures in the park"
Let's go see!
--It could be dangerous if a car came. --It's been two hours since we've been away from the school!
But if it's diarrhea from drinking too much water, they're okay, right?
I've taken what measures I can for now. Make sure to keep him warm.
--What? --What? --What?
I'm sorry... Kurosuke, I'm sorry!
Can I give this to him?
Oh. Never mind.
"Ah, I'm so tired..."
yak it up and dawdle around during cleaning time.
Why don't you talk to someone about it?
Tell Babbit!
Huh? How come?
You'll be in the way.
...who gave them that chick, right?
You know what? When you make an egg warm, it turns into a chick.
Of course they can't.
Welcome back, Aono.
living in these apartments. It's like one big house, you see.
You had some fried chicken just this morning, didn't you?
Sensei, are you done with your manuscript yet?
Am I a girl who doesn't learn from experience?
Maybe I'll just live here with Piyoko.
I'm begging you, be quiet, please!
? And so, tomorrow as well, cock-a-doodle-doo! ?
What? What? What's the matter?
Good afternoon. Is Piyoko here?
Your head is funny!
Lately, people have been getting too used to my hairstyle as normal,
Look! I've got this one, too!
The school is wide open, so you can crow as loud and as much as you want.
Yaah!
And then, Sana falls into the devilish clutches of her ex-husband!
"Please use responsibly..."
i...panic!!i
Did I get him?
What are you, a magician?
Terrific.
Goodbye! Thanks for the ugly bunny!
Isn't he cute?
Ho, ho, what else?
Mama's ex-husband gave it to me! What can I do!?
Ex-husband? Ah, I read about it in that book.
Oh, what kind of unsavory place?
Secret international organization?
"Oh! This is a serious development!!"
I guess you could call it male romanticism.
I traveled throughout all of Japan's mountains
And before that, I traveled to the lakes of the world,
...make prints with, and then sell them with my autograph, or something?
Are you telling me you gave me this lame doll...
...just so that I would do some job which I don't even know anything about?
You can! Sure you can! If you can do it, you can do it!
All right! I'll do what I can for you, ex-husband!
--to come work together with us. --and be one of Japan's foist-rate comedians!
--Um, I'd like to ask you --and they'll awl be stacked,
R- really?
Okay, the day after tomorrow, then.
The guy who gave you that lame doll?
Think about it.
He's sure to be a perverted, pedophiliac special old fart.
And touching my breasts-- although you didn't squeeze...
That's amazing. I'm surprised.
Let's together, Gekidan Komawari!
Hey, thanks for coming.
It's tasty, right?
Tasty, tasty, and it'll be easy, well-oining woik, right?
Any way you look at it, this appears to be a church.
Those guys are carrying pistols, right?
You've already been working us hard all day up to now!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight.
Once Kurata comes out, we jump out and start running around acting wild.
It's showtime!!
This is your fault for being so ambiguous, sir.
But with today's events, we have an agreement to write that debt off.
I'm happy just to be eating anything this good! This really is tasty woik!
How is this tasty!?
Once it has some money saved up in it, please return it to me. --Ryosuke"
Now you understand the man's true nature, right?
What is this, Father Hayama!?
it's time to get out of there!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
Sana, I found the decorations for the tree in the storeroom.
Yay! Together with Naozumi-kun! Together with Naozumi-kun!
Are you sure this guy's name isn't Sam?
Yeah.
Anything's fine.
Stop!
He's coming this way! What do we do? What do we do? What do we do, Akito-kun?
W- well, how about it, Akito-kun?
In that case, I'll be declaring my feelings to Sana-chan very soon.
For one thing, I'm not even sure what he likes.
Say something here, Akito-kun!
I'm winning.
What?
an8"World's first! Karate vs. trumpet"
That's right...
Still, I tried to do something about this, myself.
Tarantaru loves Japan's anime and kappamaki sushi rolls!
First Asasko, now Sana-chan! Damn you, kissing scenes!
...an octopus, relaxing by the sea...
It might not have been my first kiss.
We heard, Sana-chan.
Your eyes meet, and then Naozumi-kun suddenly...
--She doesn't want to do this! As her manager, I- --I can't do it! No!
but for some reason, I can't! I can't! I can't!
I just suddenly wanted to see your face, Hayama, that's all.
It was on the cheek.
You decided it was on the lips all on your own, right?
I could say the same to you.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
A Heart-pounding Kiss at Christmas
"So what is it you're trying to say, Father Hayama?"
"She's here..."
"Love-Love, Father Hayama's Song"
I love autumn! After all...
How sharply deduced of me!
going around with the girls these days. "Middle birthdays."
Are you saying I'm not!?
I'm always having to do this.
that is to say...
Eh?
she reminded me a little more of the Statue of Liberty in New York--
Not really.
Yeah, yeah, like he had an alligator stuck in his back teeth,
Girlfriend?
Now then, I think I'll treat myself to a little tub time,
Grandma!
I heard that story once from Mama a long time ago.
Grandma here would be scary to run into on the road at night.
First! Hailing from Kusatsu, in Gunma Prefecture, I am Okegawa Hachitaro.
I do a little karaoke.
Yes, hailing from Kusatsu-
Who is this man?
"Onda, you fool!! Heh heh heh heh" What kind of a trick is this!?
Would you please cut it out, already!?
And who are you, eh!? What kind of attitude is that to be taking toward Madam Misako!?
I was unaware that you were one of the Madam's business associates.
You are the only one who can take over Kurata Inn,
A cute Sensei?
Mama was?
Don't worry, don't worry, it's the truth.
Shimura, call the liquor store and fish shop!
Okay, one moment please.
Search me.
That's the kind of work I've been doing lately.
"Ruse" Grandma...
Yes? I see. Understood.
This?
and watch "Child's Toy" every week, without fail, Ma'am...
Oh, no!
Coincidence? I- I don't think it's a coincidence.
Could it be that she is scheming to leave Kurata Inn to Sana now?
And if you want, why don't you go along with Sana to Kusatsu
and serve as Kurata Inn's head clerk?
Mistress, the folks from the Babbit firm have arrived.
It will be a lively family!
What, now?
? It's been entertaining and funny, thanks for coming! ?
This boy...
What!?
Hey, what's the big idea, eating cake and running like that?
she won't run into a devil like Kashima Ryosuke.
Well, a long-established hot springs inn,
We will see you later!
"Seat belt"
"Kiss of an Angel"
"And so, the day of the drama filming..."
That was dangerous.
I know it's a hackneyed expression,
Sorry.
Actors are all like that, aren't they?
What is this!?
At this point, you should hold a press conference and announce it!
It's time we got going.
Come on, come on, "Child's Toy"! Watch "Child's Toy"!
Sana-ichan...i
I'm just not seeing her so that she can concentrate on her work.
I just took my eyes off the road for a moment. I won't do it again.
Oh, there's a landmine right there, too.
iHello?i
Sorry, but we're about to do a take. Bye.
She hung up on you pretty abruptly, huh?
Of course I will! I'll go together with you.
Whoa, this is bad!
What do we do!? What do we do!?
"It's dangerous to dance in the car" Good boys and girls don't dance in the car.
Er...
Wherever you are, at all times, you have to think about Sana above all else.
A kiss is all in a day's work for an actress.
she loves him because she's kissing him?
No you don't! Even if those two really are seeing each other,
Huh? But I can't dance.
If this is your first appearance, you should identify yourself.
What are you doing here?
More reporters and such could still come barging in on you.
What's that?
Pinch "Child's Toy"! Touch "Child's Toy"!
"This clarification conference is over"
"The Yellow Letter Co."
"An odd turn of events"
It really is just an innocent, insignificant picture, ma'am.
They're together, all right.
"Ah, that was scary" You big chicken!
Who is he?
This one is from just recently.
I can sort of make out the face on this Hayama boy,
Maybe so, but it's not conclusive.
A little precocious, like you are on TV, then.
You must be fairly ahead of the others in school, too.
No, I couldn't...
Nothing, much.
They caught me, and peppered me with questions.
Something funny's going on...
I just got a little careless.
Not really.
You did?
Don't tell me he's after a two-shot of me and Hayama...
"Ah, that was scary" If you're scared, you should stop butting in.
All right, he's finally gone, huh?
That's not so unusual, though.
"An odd turn of events" That's odd...
The snake!
Get it together!
Everyone wants to know the private affairs of Kurata Sana, idol to a nation.
What are you talking about? Morning tomato juice.
Ho... You're...
What!?
Sensei...
--I will tell Papa Hayama myself. --Sensei, you're going too far! That's crazy!
This is Hayama Fuyuki.
Yeah, well, that may be true...
What are you going to do?
I heard what happened from Natsumi. We'll be fine. That picture is no big deal.
Why should we have to be put through that unpleasantness!?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Hey, stop poking me where you shouldn't be.
You need something from Dad?
You kids are cooking dinner by yourselves? What's your mom doing?
That's the head.
That's okay, that's okay!
? then add some chopped-up bacon. ?
Were you trying to cajole the children into appealing for my sympathy?
You are so crooked! All you ever look into is the seedy side of people,
Hmph, that's the line of work I'm in.
Like there's a cactus inside them, pricking at them!
Akito, hurry and make me a stegosaurus!
Ah! Akito is in it, too!
Well...
All right, given the circumstances, maybe I'll even sign it.
It was nothing. Your dad sure takes nice pictures, huh?
However, I will say this. I don't care who gets hurt.
You don't say, you don't say.
Okay, you're on!
Don't touch it all night long. It's not dry yet.
Ah, it's gotten so late. Father Hayama must be worried.
Nah, my old man is pretty carefree.
Those two youngsters...
"Those grounds were..."
Want to have some tea with me? I've got some meaty buns, too.
Yeah, that sounds good!
...was Oki Isao, age 41.
So, you felt the same way, huh Hayama?
Then why did you come here, huh? You really aren't being very sincere.
and you just happened to be passing by?
That's why you came by?
From the police?
...mohawks...
You know what? Masafumi said that I was the child of a bad father,
Hurry up!
Mm-hmm, but I get the feeling that he's overdoing it-
I'll be right there!
What?
If I were to say something here,
You just said all of that.
Leave me alone, would you!?
Hayama...
Yes, he does!
Adults may have their situation, but children have their situations, too!
Your mom is sure to realize that in time,
Friendly chop!
Huh? Your dad is being released tomorrow?
So, it was in order to help those kids?
Mm-hmm. Those kids were skipping cram school, and goofing around.
Dad was wrong to have used violence,
but knowing that he did it to help someone makes me a little glad.
No way.
I'll bet he will be pretty lonely, if nobody goes there.
I'll be back later!
It's not a sandstorm, and it's not a typhoon, and it's not a tornado...
But what was the reason why we're doing this, again?
Love Tastes Like Curry
Both today and tomorrow, I've got time to kick back.
and yet you always shilly-shally,
You sure are cheery in the morning.
That's no fair, Hayama! How come you're the only one unharmed?
--saw my composition from then, and... --Sana-chan, that's so interesting! Would you right more? Let's put out a book!
 Write, write, round, round, triangle, square! 
Actually, you were going to buy your present along time ago.
Here, how about this place?
H- have I guessed right, Hayama?
Welcome!
What is it you're looking for?
A Christmas present for your girlfriend?
--D- do you do that like this? --No, it's like this.
--To think that Akito-kun would be this stressed... --What does she need?
I know! A brassiere!
That's a relief, huh? Huh? Huh? Akito-kun?
You told me your father bought it for you, didn't he?
Here.
Akito?
Your dad can come home early on Christmas Eve this year.
What company do you work for, anyway?
Wait, Akito! Akito!
So long as it's from the heart, she should be happy with anything you get her.
--I'll have to work on Christmas, because the Sensei won't finish her manuscript. --Dreams... flowers... love... hope...
Here, Onda-kun!
Oh! It's finished!
It's not like the others you've been tricking me with up to now,
Now I'll be able to take my girlfriend out and... Yahoo!!
Sana-chan...
I have plans every year on Christmas Eve.
Be looking forward to it!
Kozue-chan? How does Christmas Eve look? Oh, no good, huh? I see...
W- what's this?
Dinnuh? Okay! Okay! Uh-huh! Okay! I did it!
Thank you, God!
Here's a self-portrait!
You're going to break out in song?
Mother would like to join in, but- whoa-oa-oa...
Why not!? Why not!? Why not!?
--Whoa, it's cold out here. Someone let me in. --"Processed meat," huh?
Go on, take it. Go on, go on.
--Amazing! That's Sana-chan for you! --I guessed right! Mambo, woo! Good job! Mambo, cha-cha-cha, woo!
so I'll let that go as your present.
I- it can't be... it can't be...
--Oh, let's relive that day once more! Return, limbo! Again, limbo! --B- but today isn't Christmas, right? And yet why... why? I- it can't be...
Come! Come! Together!
What was that?
Hey! It looks like you're having fun without the main character! I'm coming, too!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Ah, this is unusual! A stray dog!
Yeah.
you have to clearly tell her "I love you," or it won't get through to her.
Woo-hoo! A present from Hayama! Woo-hoo!
Really? Good, good.
Shut up.
No...
--Sana-chan is dense. You have to clearly tell her, or it won't get through to her. --A bedpan? A butt? A belly-button? A big salamander?
Is she your daughter!?
Sometimes, Hayama's eyes can paralyze others...
...tasted just like his lips.
Asako...
What is it? What is it? It's so early in the morning...
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
and part 2, "Sabin-ga-bibin-ga-bonba-bibo," a deluxe 2nd story thrown in as well!
"Love Tastes Like Curry"
...what is the meaning of this!?
The current situation?
...something terrible happened yesterday at cleaning time!
You were going to say you weren't any good at it, and push it all on me, huh?
Hardhead! Anyhow, the girls are not cleaning!
Doesn't it somehow seem that this problem has doubled?
I've got this!
According to this, if you marry a man
What was that? Don't go talking it up the way you want it!
You won't say it? If you won't say it, then how about I say it for you?
Hayama! Is that what you mean!?
It doesn't matter either way, does it?
What!?
I declare an all-out battle with the boys!
Will the gentleman who is hardheaded about me

"Envy"
"Drama Casting"
"Shorokutai Special: New song, 'Vitamin Love' rehearsal"
"Kurata Sana that way!"
That does sound interesting.
What would that be?
That was some nice naming. You've got a good sense for it.
Then, you won't come?
What should we do for presents?
Hey, will you guys come, too?
Hey, what about you, Hayama?
Everyone from "Child's Toy" is coming.
He said you'd be doing both the song and the dance
Her cheeks are starting to turn red.
but we did meet at rehearsal-
Me, neither. Okay, actually, I just heard about it a little while ago.
I know you must be busy, but if you can, I'd like you to come.
Zenjiro? Who's that?
It's not "Notsu," it's "Tsu." Just plain "Tsu."
and it says that they are completely incompatible, huh?
Woof! Woof woof woof!
What kind?
Nah...
She was here standing by just a moment ago.
Um, I'm hoping we do well together on today's drama rehearsal-
Are you sure?
the final day of shooting arrived just like that!
Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof!
I've absolutely had it with this! I hate the drama, the song, and everything!
After all, the three of us all seem like different people!
--This is so embarrassing! --Over-the-hill cue ball!
Mm-hmm. Oh, is he planning to play his trumpet next?
Hmph. Why do I have to do this?

Then, what is this?
Ooh... aah...
Oh, I've done it again.
"Sugita"
--Homework!? --Homework!? --Homework!?
But these cookies are so delicious.
It will be done right away, okay?
Huh? I'm popular?
And then, remember, back in kindergarten,
You're cool, Big Brother!
We don't need to hear about it.
N- nothing at all. I'm going to go on ahead, okay?
Wow, what am I going to do?
Strange?
He seems to be avoiding me somewhat, too. What could be the matter?
That's got nothing to do with anything.
when you like someone, you like them.
He had a weird habit of getting stuck on them
99!?
Uh, sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'm heading out first, okay?
Aya-ichan...i
Sensei, is there anything you want right now?
Hush, would you?
Thinking up Christmas presents isn't easy.
She'll be in middle school next year, and she has more money than I do.
Okay, when in doubt, go orthodox-
Okay, okay, ladies, thank you! Okay! Okay!
Let them keep fawling for you, I say.
Whenever I get a present, I immediately fall in love with the one giving it.
I heard, I heard! What's going to happen?
You sure got Tsuyoshi good, huh?
They smell nice.
Which means... Tsuyoshi will never be able to escape from these cookies, huh?
Tsuyoshi has been nabbed by a girl while still in grade school.
I- I'm a hopeless boy!
This smells like another conspiracy.
"Bow your head!"
"Obana Family"
Oh, I have a date planned!
Sana, I found the decorations for the tree in the storeroom.
Can I help, Sana?
Tarantaru loves Japan's anime and kappamaki sushi rolls!
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
I always feel Relax,
I'm Kurata Sana,
It can be really tough being the lead character, ma'am.
Aya-moth...
Princess Sana! Terrible news!
"Man moth" proportions...
I wasn't unaffected.
Apparently, it was around here that Mama was sprinkled with Haya-moth's scales.
Hey, wait! Hey, wait!
T- that's because we had on airbags.
I just played a little prank on the god of the forest.
I put a small landmine on the forest god's chair.
I'm Tsuyo-moth.
This is a strange development...
It's only me and my copies that release scales.
and dancing other than limbo dancing is inexcusable!
You have a responsibility to defend its people!
I didn't want to take on this form, either.
Sana- Princess!
Hey, wait the hell up!
Everyone is in a panic because they've turned into moths,
when all they have to do is take baths. Isn't that dumb?
--D- does Princess Sana know about that? --Didn't you hear me when I told you to wait up!?
Don't sell me short!
"Back against the wall."
That's what you say about times like these.
 It's time for gym, so bring out the vaulting boxes. 
Not so, ma'am. This episode takes place in a primitive age.
You won't understand most of the dialogue, so watch out!
This is a prehistoric school!
Did he really say all that just now?
"He was a bad guy, but you have to feel bad that he's been pera-rimbo-ed, huh?"
"The magician manga artist, Obaba" Who is this "Obaba"?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there.
And our usual classroom...
mquick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
"RRRRRRR"
"Andoh Polynesian Sumire!"
"Seized"
You sure are cheery in the morning.
I'm not.
Oh, I see...
Remember, when we went to outdoor school,
So, you're turning your composition into a book?
Call it an "essay," please!
Then, it could be interesting if you wrote about this upcoming party, huh?
Naozumii-kuni?
Then Kamura Naozumi suddenly showed up.
You'll find something when we look in the stores!
Wow, nice!
--D- do you do that like this? --No, it's like this.
Whatever.
You don't have to think so hard about it.
to that dinosaur exhibit, right?
Don't hate them.
Akito?
What company do you work for, anyway?
Right! Christmas is really on the 25th, after all...
Oh! It's finished!
Oh, right! I've got a present for you on Christmas Eve!
This isn't woiking!
I called every goil in the book! How could I not get a single one!?
Okay, let's toast!
Happy now?
Here. Your present.
Merry Christmas, Sumire.
That's strange. Taiko drums at Christmas?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Come! Come! Together!
For me?
Do you think it's alright to just come into someone else's home without asking?
Come here. I'm nothing to be afraid of.
You can come visit me anytime!
I wonder if the reason why she cares about me
S- sure...
I don't get it.
What is this!? What's going on!?
The Kurata household... has gone bankrupt.
"Haya-moth keel-over spray"
"I'm calling you out, Hayama!!"
"Sana, in a fight, winning is all that matters. Winning."
What is this!?
"Kuraataland"
When it gets dark out, you may want to fly near light bulbs and fluorescent lights,
Princess Sana! Terrible news!
Yes, it is still there in her room.
Now that all of her subjects are rapidly turning into moths,
"Man moth" proportions...
Bring me my protective suit!
Princess, dressed like that, you really shouldn't...
--Princess Sana... --What's going on!? Which one's the steering wheel!?
...no matter what!
Hey, wait! Hey, wait!
Tsuyoshi, why you...
You did it! Incredible! Incredible!
My eyes are spinning round and round!
W- we're lucky we survived, huh?
No time to sit here talking! What's that!?
Okay, I'll be a good boy.
Hey, you!
--I'll kick your ass! I'll kill you! --Those are pretty vulgar words for a princess.
Isn't it? It's fun.
Here is the thing about boys and girls:
This has been Andoh-moth's lecture.
As princess, you know what to do, don't you?
I'm sorry, Haya-moth!
Let's give it up. This land is done for.
Are you mocking me!?
My queen! H- how did you return to normal?
I just took a bath.
It looks like you return to normal right away
--D- does Princess Sana know about that? --Didn't you hear me when I told you to wait up!?
? water comes splashing down from it. ?
You won't understand most of the dialogue, so watch out!
That's right! This is no time to be putting on this sort of screwy anime!
"Seized"
H- h- how can we suddenly be bankrupt!? What happened to the Kurata household!?
"The rumors were spreading"
"Babbit's drawing song"
Well, you know... I'm not sure what it is, but it's yours.
Seized... seized...
Click...
Whoa, for having an expressionless face, that was quite a dramatic touch.
Tell me, if you were to take a lady out on a date, what course would you select?
For what reason? So that we can go on living the way we always have.
And more than that, it has a roof.
Which one? Mama, which one?
It's raining tonight.
Hold it down, you ignorant jerks!
You dumb jackass! We're all miserable because of the rain!
--I'm going to bed. --Hey, there's one more page. Tonight, I'm going to write 108 pages!
Sana-ichani!
Are you okay?
Y- yeah.
Huh? Those plans have fallen through?
Hey, Uchiyamada!
Uh-uh, that's okay. I've already eaten six of them.
"You good boys and girls eat balanced meals, okay?" Do some exercise.
We got a lot of stuff, huh?
? Then we stick six beans on. ?
I came to see if there wasn't anything I could do for you.
S- sorry...
But what are we going to do with this?
Yo.
Wow, that's an out-of-character thing for you to say!
It'd be nice... if it warms up...
Hayama, it's snowing again.
that will make her a burglar.
Sana-ichani?
"Forgot something?" What?
Is there somebody in here!?
--You're not allowed to ride in that, either! --What do we do, what do we do now? We goof around, we goof around now.
--It's nice to horse around once in a while. It's nice to horse around once in a while. --T- that belongs... that belongs to the state!
I may have changed houses, but as much as before- mm-mm,
That's right, just by being alive, I'm razoring it in! I mean, raking it in!
"Suspicious fellow"
I've been waiting for this!
Really, stop playing dumb!
didn't you?
Actually, this is who I am.
Dreaming Pro?
What were you talking about!?
--Our relationship is better than that, right? --What kind of relationship do they have, exactly?
"I'm the greatest manager in all Japan!!" I'm not about to be beaten by those guys! Then again...
Say, have you found any work?
toward taking on work to begin with, right?
Are you sure you're okay with that?
Not like those lame panda glasses.
Welcome back! You must be hungry, huh? Want to have supper?
at this point?
Ah, that's a load off!
Whoa! That's dangerous, mister!
That's right!
"2 hours pass"
Right. I forgot!
It's hard enough to write a two-page composition for Language Arts.
and getting hers extended, isn't she?
You see, I asked the editor in chief here if he wouldn't publish my book-
Editor-in-Chief, we're the ones who requested Kurata Sana to write for us.
B- but, this will truly sell. Really, I mean like mad.
--Where? --Look closer! It's there! See? See?
W- where?
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I have to write! I have to write! I have to write!
"30 minutes pass"
"To me, those three days of outdoor school are radiant memories."
"1hour passes" Okay, an hour has gone by.
I want to eat ramen.
I'm going to run to the convenience store!
"2 hours pass" Bedtime.
? Like a two-humped camel, trudging along easily, ?
He's not satisfied with just the entertainment industry,
It would be impossible for a normal human to go to school
and finish writing it by Monday.
I'm not going to be beaten by that mean old fink's dirty tricks!
--and you look wasted away! --I am wasting away.
how about a little obstructive handiwork, just in case?
Sometimes irrational things happen in this anime...
"Now shooting" Okay, this is a take!
And that's why I'm working so hard.
Well, keep working at it.
But then, if we did that,
Sorry I can't come here to pick it up for you.
"Mother watching over me" Mother, what are you doing?
"Mother exhaustively watching over me" Stop it.
Thanks to you, I can keep working hard. I can keep writing.
Thank you, Hayama. I'll keep working.
Ondai-sani!
I'm finally finished!
Ah, I'm so sleepy...
That girl is the one on "Child's Toy."
and for an American feeling, Texas!
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
a 6th grader and TV personality affiliated with Gekidan Komawari.
Right now, he's earnestly on the way to becoming a fine manager.
Hayama Akito, my natural enemy.
Seized... seized...
That's just a supermarket receipt, so it doesn't have any bearing.
But that means that all of your property will be seized, right?
but this is real.
and talk about our futures over slightly bitter espressos.
You are being evicted immediately!
Evicted?
We're raking it in just by being alive.
That's right! It's not as though they've taken our lives from us, huh?
Sensei! Sensei! I found something!
A cooperative apartment!
This is the apartment that I lived in before.
Uh, it's not to your liking, then? I'd suppose not. It's dirty and cramped.
Sana! We'll climb our way out of here to reach for tomorrow's stars!
Which one? Mama, which one?
Hold it down, you ignorant jerks!
So, this is the end of this year.
and the new school term started.
an8"The rumors were spreading"
Say, are you depressed?
I- is that true, Sana-chan? Why did that happen? Aah, poor Sana-chan!
I heard.
Yum! Yum!
Let me take care of it. These are costumes, but you can take them awl if you want.
Oh, they give us these bento lunches to eat at work.
Oh, but Mama is there alone in our room.
I knew it.
 and draw in the eye like an arrow. 
 Let's draw one more arrow. 
If there's anything I can do for you, feel free to ask.
See, the company president told me to come check on you,
to make sure you weren't having any problems, so that's why I'm here.
I am grateful for your concern.
This is just a small token from him.
It seems like I've seen that man with absolutely no taste in clothes
Look forward to the answer next time.
Shut up! You're going to wake up Ayana-chan!
It sure would.
"The Kuratas' former house"
Sure enough.
This thing is warm!
Thank goodness.
I may have changed houses, but as much as before- mm-mm,
That's raking it in, Sana-chan!
This can't be possible...
Sana-chan sure is strong, huh?
What about school?
Tidak apa-apa, Nday kambay kambay
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...
it's all "waah!" over here,
and the whole Earth is spinning the wrong way.
So at this point now, yeah at this point now,
DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Once your lips touch, you can't change your mind.
He Got Me Blacklisted
"Produce a relief sculpture for graduation"
--How could I have committed such an indiscretion --Disgracefuloose?
so after I put you to bed,
Don't work so hard on stuff like that!
No matter how you look at these photos,
Okay, our couple with the gossip about them, we're about ready to go!
Okay, cut! 20 minute break.
plus the word for "history."
In short time, I'll be in middle school, so...
I'll be in middle school soon?
Aah, I forgot! Tomorrow, I've got Guidance!
All right, it's done!
What do you want!?
Just kidding...
Think of something more normal! This is a graduation ceremony!
I'm her guardian.
Sorry, sorry.
I cannot go along with her attending Jinbo Middle School!
and concentrate our efforts on overcoming his weaker subjects,
If he tests for another school, then even if he is rejected,
Gomii-kun...i
You have matters that come before your grades
and your advancement consultation.
Who do you have with you from home today?
What for?
Huh?
It was, huh?
"Gomi Legal Office"
Yes.
Did something happen?
So what!? Are you saying that Mama trying to work
Akito, are you being weird?
--That's positively, positively, positively weird! --Amitabha, seaweed...
Hisae-ichan...i
"Gomi is all alone"
What do you think you're doing!?
What's the matter? Want me to bring home sushi again?
"Babbit's drawing song"
No, I didn't.
Now, listen here, Father!
It'll all turn out-
I figured he's the kind of guy that would pull something,
Yeah.
What's the matter, Gomi? You're suddenly so serious...
If saying that I didn't do it doesn't do any good...
Hello, is that you, Shinichi? Why are you calling me here?
Hello? Shinichi!? Answer me!
we enrolled him into Jinbo Elementary, with its escalator system.
Don't forget to take that jacket of yours home tonight.
--?A five-hour wait!? --?A five-hour wait!? --Their scene has been cut, huh Director?
"The next day..." I can also write with it.
For self-defense. You want to use one too?
What was that thing!?
"Child's Toy Taping"
You call that a cold!?
? pour it into the form, choco-toririn, and you get one huge Sana choco-rin! ?
I didn't think you'd really fall for it this year, too.
And as for girls likely to give out chocolates...
--Why!? --Why!? --Why!?
Take it! Take it! Take some chocolate!
Geez, who's the jerk who thought up the idea of Valentine's, anyhow?
Thank you!
We're not shooting tomorrow, so I'll take mine today.
Oh, I'm glad to hea-uh that.
"Child's Toy Taping"
Ill?
No, no, that's not what they mean. Apparently, he's prone to absenteeism.
he's had a habit of skipping out on jobs in the middle of them.
All right, let's do it!
On your marks!
Director...
This is bad!
Everyone is waiting for you. Really.
I'd like to go see the ocean at night.
You know something? It's nice to listen to just the sounds of the waves at night.
The way I've lived my life has always been like this.
so we each complemented what the other was missing.
...the one I loved...
"Begging your pardon..."
Eat it! You'll feel better! It has my love baked right in!
Sorry to keep you!
Now, onto the next day, Valentine's Day!
For those of you who say "Do it until you drop dead!"
"Gnileef dab a tog evi."
"Gnileef dab a tog evi."
I've got a bad feeling.
"What Hayama is concerned about is..."
"Picture of the new house"
Yeah, a little. It's like I've got a hole in my gut,
French cuisine?
"What Hayama is concerned about is..." Hayama... Hmm, that's a tough position to be in, huh?
So that's why.
I've been expecting you.
Here.
Sometimes, I just don't know what I should say. It would be weird to apologize!
Yo, Piyoko! Nice not to have to worry about anything, huh?
All right! My daughter at the top of the rankings is a dream no longer!
Right now, it's about the money.
So it seems.
"Yatsugatake is currently covered in snow!!" Yatsugatake is a mountain range
Oh, whoops!
Too late, you already are! Maybe I'll stay here forever.
It's Gojo Takeshi! At least remember his name!
I see... Okay, bye.
Just doing a little shopping.
I mean, my insides were feeling all tight and stiff, you know?
You really are amazing.
At first, I was running away, too.
Ah, then you asked Sana to?
You mean, boyfriend!
I'll be back later!
"Picture of the new house" Yeah, be back soon.
It's all right, It's all right, I can talk to her.
Ah, that was a suspenseful one, huh?
"A little while later"
Aah! What's going on this morning!?
Actually, I'm going to have a new house before I know it!
There's something that's gotten me a bit down, you see...
Sure.
Take-ichan...i
Surprise to me!
I never heard about it!
That's my Mama! The life of our dreams from royalties, and a masterful advance!
and they said they'd like to extend it another week.
But then, it will all work itself out, so it's okay.
Not to worry! I have one, I have one! It's all right!
I got us a hotel room, so we should be okay staying at the hotel for a little while.
to gather some material she had been planning on getting.
...she did seem awfully cheerful.
I'm kind of homeless right now, and all.
"Klat ot tnaw I!"
and he wants to talk it up, to let the words fly,
to say something, to say something, but what can you do?
Why me!?
Whenever he comes up, she stops listening to what I say.
We're in love with each other!
The flowers of our love are in bloom!
Why don't you?
If you're going to beg me that much, I'll go.
He's sure to be a really great guy.
Shut up.
My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
I always feel Relax,
I finally got him where he's vulnerable!
I did it! Take that!
"However, as for Sana-chan"
Yeah! Let's go see!
Where do they get off calling other people ugly with the faces they've got?
Don't you think so, Sana-chan?
It makes me think he's not all that bad a guy.
--He's terrible. --See? Ghastly ugly, right?
What is it with him?
As long as you play nicely with everyone,
It's... not Hayama...
Grrr! Komawari is on Saturday and Sunday!
Let's go all-out!
W- w- w- why do you have to be like that!?
Uh, no... I don't care anymore. If you want to die, you can just do it yourself.
--Mama, you're all flustered. --This is too strange!
Sana-chan, that's an unusual getup you're wearing.
I sure am! Cheery, cheery, monkey, monkey, ookie, lucky! Rei-kun...
It's because I'm going to make breakfast for my beloved Mama and Rei-kun!
Thanks.
It's fine.
Sana-chan...?
All the other kids have already finished their parent-teacher conferences!
All the others' parents have come, I said! This is my last year of middle school!
This is your fault, Akito!
Everything is your fault!
and the lead character, Sick, is my sister...
Now, you're not the teach-uh, how come you're running things?
--Your sister is here, right? --H- hold on a minute...
I can't help it if it burned!
Oh dear, Sana-chan, you're here?
you...
She's a regular person.
 When nighttime comes, it's dark all around, 
I'm going to do my best, and I'm going to have Hayama's family watch it,
Sana-chan...
but I can't leave this alone.
Rei-kun, this is going to go over well for sure!
All right!
to always go along with the scenario.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
and yet you always shilly-shally,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
What do you mean, you're canceling again!?
Sana-chan doesn't have any work?
--They've all been called off. --I didn't think I'd ever get to eat this
Hey, give it back! Give me back my omelet roll!
Survival of the fittest! It's either eat or be eaten in this life!
Nothing doing!
Really, stop playing dumb!
Nope.
Why did you suddenly cancel only Sana-chan!?
There's something strange going on.
That's it! Tsu-san! Tsu-san! This is perfect!
Ah! You can't avoid me! Now, please, tell me!
Please wait! Tsu-san!
No, no, the name is Akudo lzo.
Dreaming Pro?
and you will be unable to put your skills as her manager to work,
As Sana-chan's manager, I believe I will continue to respect her policy, and so...
Tsu-san, you just met with Akudo-san from Dreaming Pro, didn't you!?
N- nothing at all, really! We were just having a little dinner together!
Sagami-san, please, don't tell anyone I told you!
Ah! Well, bye now!
--Using underhanded tricks to take away Sana-chan's work to get her to join them? --Now, now, easy, easy...
Rei-kun! Hey, Rei-kun! What's with the stingy snail attitude!?
the bare bulb will just glare brightly,
 at White Chrysanthemum Manor. 
Oh, Sana-chan...
Kurata Sana-chan, right?
Butterflies come flying in,
with tails growing out of their behinds.
This is the Sana-chan drawing song!
Rice cake, bump, bump, line, line, triangle,
No thanks.
Listen, Sana-chan,
an8"Rei-kun's sake?"
You shouldn't be asking me, it's not my decision to make.
Can't you do something? Please!
"Sorry!! Leave."
Welcome back! You must be hungry, huh? Want to have supper?
Heh, it almost sounds like we're newlyweds, huh?
After all, I don't have any work, so I was thinking of joining Drea-Pro or somewhere.
They won't get away with it! If that's how they want it, I'm going to go pound them!
Sounds like fun. I'll go with you.
You've finally gotten serious about this, have you?
Silence, you Knucklehead!
Now come along quietly!
I have no intention of ever joining your outfit!
When you sing this song, your worries will go
The Delirious Nick-of-Time Deadline
What's important is the present! Not to mention the future!
Proof, you say? All right...
Yes, step right up and see for yourself, here are the pictures that prove it!
I think she's in her study.
Twelve years ago? That means...
Now, get out of here at once, before Sana realizes you're here.
Nothing. At the time, that's just what occurred to me.
I wasn't supposed to understand, though,
There, okay.
Eh!? A co-starring role!?
I just wanted to find out the truth. Please answer me, yes or no.
Him?
so he's ruined his health.
so I invited him to come live here for a while.
It was "Wait just a minute"!
Wait just a minute!
Yes, you are waiting, aren't you?
You don't say. Perhaps you'd like to take the personality assessment test?
--to those who work hard! --to those who work hard!
They're perfectly matched.
Sana here!
Oh my, it's broken.
on the "Child's Toy" staff now.
--Hear that? --Yeah, you even rattled my brain cells.
"I'm afraid... one month...?" Uh... um, you mean... G- Gojo!?
Dad!
Whew! I wonder if it's going to rain during tomorrow's location shoot, too.
The nerve of him!
Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy! Vrep dlo sselemahs uoy!
Never mind. That man will not be staying with us long. I can guarantee you that.
D- Dad?
You ate right and everything...
"What did the doctor and Mama talk about?"
From now on, I'm going to oversee your nutrition, okay? Get well soon, now.
Yes, he does appear to require some rest, but for now, he seems to be all right.
Nicely evaded!
Maybe you're right.
This is your consideration for earlier, and some hush money.
I can't wait to see the script for the last episode.
Ordinarily, Babbit isn't supposed to get involved in the story, you know...
A thousand paper crane's worth of paper in one crane!
I can't take that, okay? I absolutely cannot take it.
They suspended everything where it was yesterday,
That would be a dream.
Wha-!?
These othuh charactuhs are bettuh at portraying humans.
Reii-kuni!
What's this here?
You get a lot of... how shall I say... presence with it.
Did they drop me?
Right now, just think about this Golden Drama,
Pleased to meet you.
When one door closes, another one is opened.
I'm going to stake my whole life on this drama.
She's the one who suggested that I should get plenty of rest now,
You're going to die, and leave things unfinished!
What are you doing, Snake!?
My age has caught up to me.
Oh, they gave me a shot, and I got better.
Well then,
Take-ichan...i
Start!
We're going to do the last scene now.
and as the dad holds his daughter, and the daughter holds her dad,
Ooh, I'm going to cry!
At the end, I finally made it... at the end...
"Danger!! Frequent Avalanches No Entry"
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What's going on? Where's the usual "I'm Kurata Sana" part?
Smile, we tricked you!
Should I die even more ostentatiously next time?
Come on, let's dance together!
Oh, I heard, I heard!
Gojo Takeshi! That is his name!
Sana-ichani!
We'll always, always be together.
He said we'd always be together.
? Drink it up right now! Drink it all down! ?
I'll never go anywhere again.
"Anas Ataruk!" What was that?
The problem is...
--Off, to Yatsugatake! --Off, to Yatsugatake! --Off, to Yatsugatake!
--A- avalanche!? --A- avalanche!? --A- avalanche!?
Come to think of it, I gave a ride to a young girl this evening
Let's sit together.
I want us to stay like this always. Always. Always.
"Danger!! Frequent Avalanches No Entry"
--What!? --What!? --What!?
Where am I?
Kurata!
No!
Hayama, your hand... it's bleeding, isn't it?
Hold on to me tightly.
If you let this life of mine go...
Is that your name?
I've seen you on "Late Night Chaos Theater"!
He was there! By my side! By my side... my... my...
There you go! She's super-gifted!
--Even in middle school, those two... --Fix it! Tearfully fix it!
"One moment please"
There is only one reason why we are gathuhed togethuh today,
Uh, listen, they say that if you drink some cold juice,
"Bottom of shoe" What do you think you're doing!?
Yeah, well, I got hypnotized by the math, and fell asleep, so now I'm panicking.
Mm-hmm! Thanks! That's real friendship!
It's hopeless.
Hayama...
What did you call me out here to talk about?
Hayama, why did you go back to being a bad person!?
Let go of me, would you!?
Andoh-isenseii!
Sure enough, it's this one.
? Then we stick six beans on. ?
? This is the Sana-chan drawing song! ?
Over here, over here!
Hey, you two!
Even I, once called the divine Big Brothuh Z, am really about to snap.
From what I've hoid so far,
Why don't you take up karate?
There, you see? Huh? You'll do it!?
but as a result of a press conference called last night by Kamura Naozumi,
it appears to be cooling off for the moment.
Yum! Yum!
For me?
So, did you have fun today?
I...
--and the others, --Z, it'd be okay for me to tell about when I was carrying on with them, right?
How did this happen!?
fscx88fscy90by ridding you...
--Why couldn't you call me earlier!? --A child who sleeps in...
...grows even more. Good morning, Sana.
Drive safely as you rip on out of here!
Rei-kun, you're just worried about Sana-chan,
Thank you, Rei-kun! We got here safely!
Where did my desk go?
It says three parenthesis minus triangle double-circle X close parenthesis, right?
--It hurts! It hurts! Away you go!
Sniffle... sniffle...
Don't sniffle-sniffle, I tell you.
--Enter Mitsuya-sensei's boyfriend!
All right! You go, Tanaka-sensei! You tell them!
What's wrong, Tanaka-sensei?
Aah! You're after him!
Sure, if he's a nice man, I'm taken with him.
That dummy needs to get "ba-bing!" socked sometime! Ba-bing! Ba-bing!
I'm glad you like it.
Made any "new good friends?"
And how about your new teach-uhs?
I shua wish I could be re-bawn as a kid again.
Every single day in our class,
Hayama Akito, of the 6th grade, 3rd Class at Shinbo Elementary School!
when you've been all backed up, and all packed up, and then...
...you poop it all out! I feel terrific!
Then he might just stir up the other boys in the class
and mail them back to them using business parcel delivery, right?
Yes, Mama! Rei-kun, let's sleep together!
"Sana-chan Sings"
 My mood graph goes up and down! 
 My mood graph goes up and down! My mood graph goes up and down! 
Good morning!
Sana-chan...
Eh? What?
Are you worried about me, Rei-kun?
I'll use these Cossack Kung Fu Steps that I learned in Gekidan Komawari
Now, even if you and I are separated, Sana-chan, by pushing this switch,
Ah! They're here!
What's so wrong with being a little cute and a smart-aleck?
I can't let you all get caught in the middle of this. Hurry!
I heard her face got pounded in.
We're scared!
"Mysterious Creature Discovered with Asian Man in Hawaii"
The name of Kurata Sana would ring throughout the world
Face pounded in!
There you are, Boss Monkey!
Toys.
Stop this! Stop already, you guys!
And our usual classroom...
And our usual classroom...
Do something about him!
I don't mind going public with this.
Cut it out already, would you, Hayama?
Yeah!
"Boys' Restroom"
Her mom's a weirdo, though.
--Festival! Fireworks! Woo-hoo!
Wash your hands!
It's all right. They're taping "Child's Toy" today,
It's too bad. I've got my pimp Rei-kun, after all.
That's going too far!
Eh? This is your first time, huh? Congratulations.
This is the first time I've ever hit anyone, too.
--Sana-chan!
Now you've done it!
Hayama-san...
Fire!!
Thanks.
How am I going lo defeat him? That's the question.
He's incredibly strong...
What can you do? Wow, Sana-chan, you're awl fired up, huh?
of today's "Child's Toy Fitness Time Special"
--I see. So she won before anyone realized what was happening,
 Take advantage of his weakness, hohoi no hoi 
Yay!
--Caterpillar! African snail! --What are you doing!?
Anatomy model!
Even you must be shaking, ready to say "Sana-chan, I give up!"
In that case, I'll show you what true terror is!
that he doesn't have a single weak spot...?
Ah, Tsuyoshi-kun... Tsuyoshi-kun, you'd have to know. That's it!
Hayama's weak spot?
Come on, come on,
Yeah! Yeah! "Help me, Tanaka-sensei!"
You got it.
That's all you said!? Look, you! Keep this fight between us!
Hey, open up! Open up, I tell you!
That's it! The rock climbing techniques you learned in Gekidan Komawari!
Was there really such a program!?
I'll just borrow these, wash them and return them later.
He's cool!
Hmm, I guess you couldn't help it if you had school.
Tsuyoshi-kun, what's the matter?
Well after all, there's nothing but really weird stuff in here.
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
...for two.
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?
My Aoki award-winning novelist Mama, and her chipmunk, Maro-chan.
Yes, I was.
Good morning!
When is it on?
Allow me to announce it! The program's name is "Late-Night Chaos Theater"!
That's it.
Sensei, are you okay with this?
Huh? You've decided not to publish Kurata Sana's book?
Hey! You're not shooting me!
I read his manuscript earlier, and it is terribly interesting.
Where?
W- where?
--Aah, time to clean! Time to clean! --Sana-chan! Get hold of yourself!
"To me, those three days of outdoor school are radiant memories."
That's right! I have the essay I wrote then!
Sana-chan...
S- Sana-chan, I thought this might happen, so I made you some egg porridge.
That's it! The reason I couldn't concentrate up to now
Huh!? The president of Drea-Pro!?
If you're that insistent about Kurata Sana's book,
Sana-chan, you're gone for just a little while,
This week's Sana-chan.
You don't say, you don't say.
All right, now I'm awake!
...it's not that great or anything.
and there's no way I want to let myself be beaten by their dirty tricks!
Thank you, Gojo-san.
Surprised you?
That's in pretty poor taste.
to get him to extend the deadline a few days?
You came too, Akito-kun!
She said her deadline was tomorrow morning, right?
Your dismal attitude is getting in the way here.
I'm watching over you.
"To tell you the truth... the thing that I...
Thank you, Hayama. I'll keep working.
9.57 cm!
Sana-chan, you did it!
And just barely in time.
Ah, I'm so sleepy, I won't last until I get home...
When you sing this song, your worries will go
Ah... it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
Bye Bye Bye
Cu: you tried your MECHA-KUCHA best,
to PECHA-KUCHA out a "Hi, "
Sing-ken-ken ken-ken, Tidak apa-apzfl
"Kodomo no Odocha"
Are you all right?
Prattle on.
Let's settle on a winner and a loser here once and for all!
Nice of you to come! Nice of you to come! Hayama!
What's with that anxious look on your face--?
Like the way we planned! Like the way we planned!
Well? Are you surprised? My Mama bought it mail order.
Hayama-san!
He's nervous! He's nervous!
She's just showing off.
I lost...
Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.
I'm sure that's the reason why I was scared of falling!
Ah! Sana-chan, that's tomorrow's script!
Um, I'm your editor, Onda. I've been waiting since last week.
Sensei, is your manuscript ready?
 Miserable defeat has me deep in the blues! 
an8"'How to Console Women' by Obana Miho"
We couldn't take that!
Pizza's here!
You guys...!
Why don't you stand up to those guys!?
Hey, stop that. Don't cry like that. Don't droop your eyes.
Stop sticking your bottom lip out like that.
Hayama?
There's no need to shout it so loudly.
Although I am starting to feel a little dizzy.
I just thought about that idiot, and I couldn't help but get fired up.
M- making out? How do you mean? Sounds interesting.
Really? Awl right! Befo-ah you tell us the way,
What's that?
Rei-kun, you're so smart!
I think that's his older sister's voice.
Get out of this house right now!
Hayama...
What? What? Why? Hey, how come? Are you sure that's Hayama's dad?
Somehow... I'm surprised...
Even he makes that face...
We're doing it after all, huh?
When did the operation get that name?
Y- you...
What are you, a tumbling act?
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
And our usual classroom...
"Lone Wolf, Awooo!"
I'm Kurata Sana, age 11. I'm a sixth grader,
This... is a mysterious white bat.
He's like the devil!
This is all of them?
Hayama, are you sure you handed over all of them?
was supposed to have been more convenient for you!
Things keep escalating like this, and your grades are going to be in danger.
Come on!
Geez, I'm so sorry.
That's right!
...she got the pictures away from him! Okay?
So that's how it gets back to me, huh?
Hayama! You broke your promise, didn't you!?
Is this any time to be saying that!? Put a stop to it, former boss monkey!
Hey.
Up until yesterday, you were kissing up to me.
Let's clearly determine right now which one of us is stronger!
H- Hayama...
Hold on! Hold on! Why is it turning out like this!? Stop!
You're no challenge at all!
--Thanks to Hayama's one punch, --If Hayama-san behaves himself,
Here goes!
Please? I'm a fan!
Ah! I've got to go to work, so if you'll excuse me...
It's like he doesn't open his heart to anyone.
You are someone who says out loud "give me your manuscript," when actually,
What were you thinking!?
 Being a lone wolf 
You called the teacher "Mother"!
When is this ever going to be a normal class?
In dire straits,
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
to always go along with the scenario.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
is true, yes it is.
Mama. She's an Aoki Laureate novelist who keeps a chipmunk on her head.
I lose!
Hey! Have you seen the new teacher 1st Class has?
Gleam!
Hayama-kun's an adult, all right!
everything is completely okay, and naturally daff-ay.
Join me?
Come on, come on, stop ignoring me!
It's... not Hayama...
I'll return that sentiment right back at you.
It's like, every year, I make more and more friends.
Some cause?
Never mind!
All right.
There. All done!
Sana-chan...?
I'm okay.
Sana-chan...?
--Really, what is it with him? --Again, one, two, three, four...
Sana-chan!
Sana-chan, I und-uh-stand you've got the lead role in an upcoming drawma.
What kind of role is it?
Um, no.
I'd hate to actually turn into a bug.
To go deliver this!
No way. Your sister asked me, after all.
You're the devil!
you...
My mother... died as a result of giving birth to me.
I don't get her.
 Sana-chan said so, so I don't take them off. 
You're right! This drama has some depressing themes,
I'm going to do my best, and I'm going to have Hayama's family watch it,
and Hayama's family will have a happy end, too! That's it!
"Back against the wall."
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
Hayama, where are you hiding yourself!? My drama is about to start!
This is your fault, Akito! Everything is your fault!
You're the devil!
You could always show up normally.
What I wanted to talk to you about was Hayama.
You must know something about it, Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
Hayama, the devil! The devil's boy!
I think it was because she called him the devil.
That's right, Onda-san.
--Onda! Onda! --Sensei!
Good little kids, have a shot of Spopotamin!
For strong little kids and good little kids, it's Supopotamin!
Good morning! I'm Kurata Sana!
Zenjiro-sensei, thank you! You came all the way here just to support me, right?
You know? So when I heard that my sister was going to be played by Kurumi-san,
--Now, listen, Sana-chan, listen... --I'm so thrilled and excited!
I wonder if he went to the bathroom. He could have at least said something.
That's strange.
U- um... K- Kurata Sana. It's nice to-- to have the occasion to meet you.
--Let's make this drama a good one. --Zenjiro-san, you only have the one line, so if you please,
It's boring without Sana-chan around.
How come that's the only way you can think of her!?
And all I ever wanted was to just he happy, too!
H- huh...?
It hurts to be told that, even when we're acting.
My favorite expression is "Boo on being slapdash."
while I play a younger sister, but even with that difference, it's still okay!
Ah. You're the nice girl
D- dimwitted...?
Like daughter, like father!
I'd probably turn into a real devil myself!
The interview went okay, and I made my declaration of war!
So how about it? Oh, here it comes, here it comes...
There isn't anything I need, exactly...
If you like, I can call him on my Burutcha.
Kurumi-san!
Never mind.
So, they finished up all the shooting today?
 Everyone will be happy, happy-py! 
 Even outside of the drama, happy-py! 
Fight time has arrived! Hayama Family, this is the last time I'm going to ask you!
Good afternoon. Rather, good evening, I suppose.
Drama? What drama?
I dunno. I've never watched anything together with them.
Do you miss not having your mother around?
Waugh! You're warm!
All right?!
I've been waiting for an answer.
...up to now, just for today,
"Kodomo no Odocha"
Whether you're awake or asleep,
This is your fault, Akito! Everything is your fault!
You demon child! If only you had never been born...!
I probably wouldn't say it went that well,
Here, Akito! Hot! Hot! I made... Hot! Hot! ...some porridge for you.
Porridge, for me?
By the way, I hear tonight, we're having chicken-and-egg over rice.
That was probably... a first...
But anyway, it was like... it was like... it was like...
Here, your usual.
Don't die!
Oh, no! We're late! We're late! We're late!
Why?
Are you okay, Sana-chan?
Ah, Asako-san!
Oh, right, Sana-chan, I suppose that interview is out, isn't it?
That's strange. I wonder why Rei-kun turned that down. My Saturday is free.
Ah, but are you sure it's okay to do it with a child like me?
Still, little by little...
More or less.
He's Sana-chan's manager.
Sensei, you're the guest today on "Laugh Away," right?
How can you talk to your daughter that way!?
W- well, actually...
for the past three days, waiting for your manuscript.
Huh? Where is your manager?
He said he was going to wait in the car, so he's in the underground parking lot.
Discounting!
Is that so?
But... but...!
an8"Work is finished!!"
Maybe I said a little too much. Oh well...
That's silly.
 Emergencies come unexpectedly! 
 Hey! Don't panic in an emergency, 
Show me your face!
No... no... Rei-kun is...
It is you, Rei!
I've been waiting for an answer.
my manager, boyfriend and pimp, Rei-kun.
Rei-kun is my boyfriend!
Excuse me for showing my regular face.
Komawari somersault!!
He nailed them to a tree in the dead of night, and then, using black magic,
Ah, she startled me!
Still, still, you know...? Still, you know...?
Good afternoon.
Please, take your time.
Holy--!
Rei-kun!
I understand.
Enough!
Well then, that makes us rivals.
Sure there's more. Rascal... Hansel... Rubber sole... Russell...
Sana-chan only ever thinks about Rei-kun,
My heart flutt-uhs at this refreshing May weath-uh!
Excuse me!
I don't have any work tomorrow.
Depressing...
About what? What are you talking about?
Despicable girl...
Sana-chan, you're incredible!
Of course I have.
That's high, huh? We're going up higher and higher, huh Hayama?
Please! I mean it.
Everyone is so small, huh?
Sana-chan, you're strange. Same as always, though.
So I said that maybe some cold juice would make her feel better.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
...panic!!
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
he's there,
Oh, I can't face Rei-kun! I know! I'll cover my face!
so something like this shouldn't be anything to you.
Sana-chan is up in the observation lounge,
Akito-kun! Akito-kun!
You keep your hands off of Rei-kun!
 I don't consider it to be a kiss. 
 Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me! 
 Hayama, you idiot, what have you done!? 
Heh, so, you've arrived. I call this... I call this...
How can this be!? I got up at 4 o'clock to make this!
Mm-hmm.
I was there at the time! I bet 10 yen on whether or not you could do it.
Don't get so full of yourself!
Oh, right! Before I forget, here's this week's Sana-chan.
Bring him here.
Oh, it's the pimp.
you're Hayama-kun?
Can a grade-school kid like you understand?
Do it as often as you like. It's quite enjoyable.
That's all.
Not to worry. I just wanted to see this Hayama boy, after all.
He ate the cake!
I'll put on a new face before entering the house...
How come you're coming out of my house!?
I don't like having to use any of my power being angry.
Just don't do it again.
In that case, let's see your face!
The fans are awl gonna be disappointed if they can't see your face, Sana-chan.
--ov-uh your head now? --without showing my face!
Oh, you're singing!? Hold on...!
 Distraught Sana-chan; what to do, Sana-chan? 
You don't need this any longer, right?
At first, Sana-chan, I thought you were still upset about that other thing,
No, no.
Oh? So you don't know what that means.
That sure would be a delicious role.
Good night!
Good morning!
so I could become an actress,
I'm so surprised!
At any rate, right now, Sana-chan is the most important thing to me.
Not until she's an adult.
I've been waiting for an answer.
Rei-kun... Rei-kun...
is true, yes it is.
Rei...
She came inside the house!? So, what is it with her!?
Rei-kun has been running away from me for some reason ever since.
Right now isn't...
What? Tsuyoshi-kun, you know her?
I'm his sister.
Yo, squirt!
Aono! You mustn't go near Akito.
You know what? When you make an egg warm, it turns into a chick. Did you know that?
Say, is it actually some special egg that a chick will hatch from?
That's stupid, isn't it?
Not you again...
Look! It happened, Sana-chan!
Heh, it really was a good thing I gave her that chick.
S- Sana-chan?
Sana-chan, that's not--
How can you laugh at a child about being a child!?
That's too much. Charge me less.
You can't go home? If you can't go home, what will you do?
He's infuriating, isn't he?
I'm just ashamed of myself.
It's a chick that allows her to dream a lie.
You want to go at it!?
Ah, it's too humiliating!
Mm-hmm.
That's Mama's car-- the special remote control version.
Yeah...
I said thanks!
Cut it out, you dumbass!
Stop acting so ridiculous and get yourself home!
Ha! You don't have to tell me! I'm going home!
Still, he did genuinely listen to what I had to say.
Mm-hmm.
an8I can't yet be the rose, shining brighter than anyone else.
I'm a little bit sad about that.
an8Good-bye love, I hope you at least believe that my love was real.
I'm all right, so why...
I'd like to think that these feelings of mine are the real thing.
In dire straits,
I've been waiting for an answer.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
so BOY, take a look my way!
Episode 11 of the Uneasy Night of Impressions and Departures Saga:
That rumor that I love you
I don't really understand him.
Yeah, yeah, cha-cha, hey, cha-cha!
All righty!
Oh, dear, Sana-chan, you're late.
Okay, okay!
Sorry, I have to shoot a commercial today.
Wow, you've got more work?
Oh, I wonder if I've branded myself as the unsociable girl!
Kill me! Kill me, please!
O Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Wishing you a 1000-year-crane, 10,000-year-turtle life!
That's no good! This is no good at all, Zenjiro-san!
Sana-chan was good enough
The season changes... and start!
Completely!
--Sana-chan, a job well done! --Nice work, Sana-chan!
Sana-chan, nice work. Here, have a towel.
I took some medicine, and got better.
Rei-kun, the path to becoming a great manager is a long one!
until Sana-chan was an adult, not long ago.
...or so Mama said.
Sana-chan...
It is you, Sana-chan. How are you?
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm not going far.
He has a crush on me!?
My pop might be dying.
Be quiet! What about you!? How can you be so unconcerned!?
Here you are.
I'm here! Is your father okay?
If Pop dies, what am I going to do?
Hayama, be strong.
Father Hayama, no! It can't be...!
Babbit came, too!
"Shimura-san is relieved."
And she's getting phone calls from him too, huh, Sensei?
but I'd like to have some sake before too long, you know, Akito?
You can't.
Mm-hmm, I was impressed.
Manager reject!
"Back against the wall."
In dire straits,
"Kodomo no Odocha"
Sagami Rei-kun, my chauffeur and manager, and former boyfriend,
My Aoki Laureate prize-winning Mama, and Maro-chan, the chipmunk on her head.
Hayama Akito. A lot has happened with him.
Cut! Right, okay. Sana-chan, good job.
Nicely done!
The next one? We just finished the seventh one, right?
Sana-chan, you were riding this wave of energy,
But I should be done by evening, so can I come after that?
I wonder if people aren't taking me too lightly lately.
Not particularly.
No! This is a juice commercial, remember?
Sure enough...
Then again, she is surprisingly delicate.
 "That water strider is blue," A - I - U - E - O. 
 "Persimmon trees, mulberry trees," Ka - Ki - Ku - Ke - Ko. 
Elegant and revitalizing, even in the jungle!
Introducing a wild body shampoo! This is work, so I have to make sure I'm smiling.
All right! Starting tomorrow, I'm going to play with everyone,
Hayama-san...
Sensei, Hayama-kun from 3rd Class is running wild in the restroom!
Hayama and Oki apparently got angry at the other boys
You sure are happy-go-lucky, huh?
Huh?
You mean, you did that much work?
Ah, Hayama-kun, something terrible has happened!
"Back against the wall."
And our usual classroom...
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha,
a wonderful, invincible Relax.
What a disgracefuloose girl I am!
Now that it's happened, would you mind having me as your mistress, sir?
Take it easy!
Oh, then I'm still a wholesome young girl.
Afternoon.
Gojo-san said he would bring her home now. Isn't that great?
Mm-hmm!
Take-chan? Take-chan?
I'm home! Take-chan brought me-
you finally come wandering in at this hour.
Gojo-san is not some man that none of us knows anything about!
It is decidedly highly possible that it could have been a man
that none of us knew anything about.
It's okay.
No matter how you look at these photos,
Now I'm getting angry. I'm going to have to think of what to do next.
Okay, our couple with the gossip about them, we're about ready to go!
Really, Rumiko-chan, your performance is- how shall I say?-
It's not as though I'm going to be in elementary school my whole life.
If it was that important a function, why did you forget about it?
 You're so dumb, you cannot advance. 
I can't get into Kaimei.
I'm home.
All right, it's done!
Get to bed!
What do you want!?
--Furikake seasoning. --Huh?
an8"Guidance time"
ask of your teacher, so this is special.
Oh, well if you were coming, you should have said so earlier!
Well, about that incident...
There are a number of obstacles unique to the entertainment world,
and there are extenuating circumstances, you see...
I will overlook it this time.
Not good enough!
I cannot go along with her attending Jinbo Middle School!
Come to think of it, Zenjiro-san was saying something to me earlier...
My, my, Zen-chan said that about me?
My, my, my!
so he can advance to Jinbo Middle School-
Are you sure that the reason his grades haven't shown any improvement...
Shinichi-san!
Mom!
Thanks to you, Zenjiro-sensei, it looks like I can safely move on to middle school,
That's nasty, Take-chan!
Gomi-kun?
That was dirty!
Welcome home.
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Bye Bye Bye
so resolve when to give up
Sing-ken-ken ken-ken
and then later comes the whimpering,
it's all "waah!" over here,
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
If you think calmly about it for a minute
Oh, but Gomi-kun just keeps sticking his feet even deeper into the swamp.
Gomi-kun, Gomi-kun, Where Are You Going?
I'm Kurata Sana, a TV personality with Gekidan Komawari, and 6th grader.
It's Babbit!
Sensei, have you heard any word from Tsuyoshi?
What is it? What is it?
Hang on! What happened!? Tell me!
Sensei called Tsuyoshi's house a little while ago, and his dad answered.
He said they'd gotten divorced, that they'd left him,
Move out of the way! You really are weak on defense.
Who needs an old man who doesn't know where his own kid lives, you dimwitted old coot!?
That lousy old man...!
No, he didn't squeeze anything, so I'm still safe!
Once it's straightened up, come on over and see it.
does so sometimes with sternness, sometimes with kindness.
Mother! Everyone said they would help!
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
I wasn't talking to you, Akito.
Cut it out, Akito-kun!
--No, that one's for the gas. --It's in that box on your left.
Mm-hmm. Sorry to make you worry.
It's okay, Tsuyoshi-kun. We're the only ones here. It's okay to cry!
I'm the oldest son... so, from now on... from now on, I have to...
...I have to be strong...
Mm-hmm! We won't tell! No way will we tell! Neither me nor Hayama.
Tsuyoshi-kun, if there's anything I can do, just tell me, okay?
so I can't be your wife, but you can talk to me about anything.
Mm-hmm. It turns out he had to move suddenly.
Sana-chan, you're good friends with Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
What do you think about Tsuyoshi-kun?
Life has its clear days and cloudy days!
 Rain will come in waves, and snow will come in waves! 
an8"That's not it"
Tsuyoshi's mommy works the registers part time at the supermarket,
three times, you know?
T- Tsuyoshi-kun does not have a mother complex!
Akito-kun, are you plotting something?
No...
Those were just random acts of chocolate, without any decency or sentiment.
I had a hunch that's what it was...!
I'm in a hurry today, so I'm leaving without you.
The producer'll get mad at us.
Sorry there aren't any presents.
This week's Sana-chan and this week's Zenjiro-chan.
Now I think that Aya-chan is better for me, you see.
W- want to walk home together?
You sure do fall in love easily, Tsuyoshi...
Okay, see you later.
You want to know about my dad?
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
is true, yes it is.
Uh-uh. She got married when she was 18, and was divorced at 20.
Uh-uh. Nope.
That's why I'm taking a little from each of them, so that it adds up to 500 total.
So, about work, once you get back from outdoor school,
She's calling...
It looks like this... is going to get very serious.
You're going to write the whole book at once, right?
so, I'd say about three days.
--Outdoor! Outdoor! Ya-hoo-hoo! --Don't go running around the house
Enough rest-- okay!
Oh, no, Sana-chan...
Have you heard about the poor quality of 3rd Class!?
It's Narunaru!
I'm uneasy about where this is going...
What are you, a goldfish?
So, did you want something?
He said to tell you thanks.
Yo, Tanuki! How's it going?
This guy's got some impressive tackle!
What are you doing, Hayama!? Oh, you startled me!
And is that usually the sort of thing you make a girl say!?
What are you looking away for?
Spacing off all the time, and stuff.
Mm-mm, nothing really.
There's something that occurs to me once in a while...
What, you ask...?
All right, let's go back and wake everyone up, Hayama.
Right! Right! It'll be fine-fine! Ha ha ha, ha!
The party starts again, the party starts again!
Keep the jokes limited to your wrinkles, you hag!
P- Principal...?
Principal! We're discussing those two right now!
an8"The second day is mountain climbing!!"
Don't be so rigid, Sana-chan. Your everyday face looks fine.
Principal!
That's all you ever say.
Can anyone pass und-ah the height of this milk bottle?
Aah! What kind of outfit did you put me in!?
There you go!
Amazing!
Okay, now who will meet the challenge of the height of this matchstick!?
an8"Caution-- Cliff!"
...going to be violated!
Whenever you get close, you do something pervy! I would know, too!
You've already got two previous convictions!
I'm not so good at it that I could act out my whole private life!
That's something else I think about.
Then why would you say such a thing?
if I was worrying about something before.
Once this essay comes out...
In dire straits,
...for two.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
My favorite food is crushed corn flakes!
Now then, about this mysterious white bat...
You're worried about something, huh?
Could a child whose mother hates them grow up to be as decent as you are?
Yeah. And if your enjoyable life together gets destroyed, then so what?
Onda-san, if you eat it too fast, you'll upset your stomach.
--Which means that Sana-chan --S- Shimura-san, do you have
--would have to be the main topic... --any stomach medicine...?
So, our family is turning into this happy circle...
Anyhow, everyone thinks that our home has gotten a little bit more enjoyable,
Kurata...
I've only ever seen you snort, or snicker,
I saw it! I saw it! I saw it! Hayama is embarrassed!
Embarrassed! Embarrassed! Embarrassed! Hayama is embarrassed!
You're a pest!
 Don't be bashful, Hayama! Look at me, Hayama! 
-- What fun!  --I guess I was wrong after all about her cheerfulness being an act.
What is the matter with you!?
I caught you, Hayama!
Wow! Looks like we managed to climb up, huh?
"If you feel like crying, come find me."
Sana-chan, welcome home.
Good. Sana-chan doesn't seem any different than her usual self.
And so, finally, it's summer vacation!!
Mm-hmm, but you know what?
The commercials!
but we can still see you on TV!
What are you talking about?
And if he's not a girl, that means he's a boy, right?
where roses appear in the background,
Disinfect yourself too long in there, and your hiney will melt away!
It would be awful if your hiney melted away, huh? You wouldn't be able to fart,
Bishonen?
What are you, stupid? I'll bet that hurt.
Listen, Akito-kun, nothing beats the Bon odori dance during the summer, huh?
Me and Aya-chan are going to it together!
H- how? My mom saw an ad in a magazine and told me.
The enjoyable life that Mama and I share now...
If it's "My Daughter and I," she must be writing about Sana-chan, right?
The commercial shoot in question
Ta-da! Well? How do you like my commercial costume?
Mm-hmm, it does, it does.
Poor things...
--Ah, you must be Kamura-kun's manager. --I can't stop by myself
Nice to meet you.
--Start! --and has appeared in several other things, I'm sure of it.
Ah, Sana-chan!
They said you can keep this. Here.
Wow, how pretty!
...panic!!
...up to now, just for today,
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
But I can't be playing around! I am a performer, after all!
That rumor that I love you
You don't mean...
It's not about food.
"Who is this Naozumi-kun?"
What!?
That's not it!
Come off it!
I know everything you've done since you were 5, Sana-chan. Look!
--for your next job! --I have to go.
Let's work together again sometime, Sana-chan. Bye!
Ah, just a min--!
Huh...?
What's the story with that boy, really? He said he had the same past that I did.
Well, I guess I'm not going to figure that out just by thinking about it.
 Wasting energy by thinking about it is like... 
You know the details of the next book that is being published, right?
Where do you hail from?
Warm-up exercises.
"Gekidan Komawari"
Sensei told me to look out for Sana-chan...
Sana-chan is practicing doing the splits.
"What a pain..."
"Summertime greetings! Here's a watermelon for you!
I'm sending you a ticket, so come see the play we're putting on! --Sana."
She said to ring her up whenever I wanted to call her,
I got it! This is it! This is it!
I'm getting sick of this anime.
Mm-hmm! Just like that.
A live performance, where outtakes are not allowed!
Youth! This is the time of our youth!
Then, do you know about how much she makes?
Yeah, more or less. Lately, the signing fee for her
 Invigorating, invigorating, nervousness, fun! 
--What foah!? I'm Zenjiro! --Go home, Mister! --I can't see!
The play continues!
Tom!
Father!
Eucie was mistaken!
even when it is difficult, and even when it hurts.
I'm awn!
...Kamura Naozumi-kun, to present our lead, Kurata Sana-San,
I didn't hear anything about this.
No? But I just had my hawt broken. Please?
Why nawt? It's going to take a lawt to fix my broken hawt, aft-uh today.
--My button has popped off. --that is treating me something awful.
Akito-kun, what are you doing!?
He's looking for some students. What do you think?
There, you see? Huh? You'll do it!?
The next heart-pounder is coming.
Tomorrow, at last... at last, the book will be coming out...
The second act is about to begin.
to always go along with the scenario.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Surprises, hiccups, and butt-shaped rice cakes!
and used to be my boyfriend.
--Thank you very much! --Sana-chan, I watch you all the time!
Thanks.
Thank you, thank you, everyone. Thanks for your support.
Sure, Rei-kun.
I'm good.
Oh well, let's go home.
I see.
She was sublime and valiant! So pretty and charming, like a goddess!
Sensei, it's too bad you couldn't be there to see her.
This has been the white bat, Babbit, coming to you from the Kurata household,
Hmph, what a rude man!
Who on earth is he?
and Sana-chan, your commercials come on one after another,
The one that cost 30,000, huh?
Come back anytime!
Salt!
If anything happens, why don't you have Kamura comfort you?
among other things,
Typically, when it is called an essay, it is true, right?
I would certainly like to ask that of the Sensei herself.
they can apparently joke about things like this,
And you're happy to see them?
She watches "Child's Toy."
"I only had a five percent chance of having a child.
then I would go on living as a strange woman?
Are you sure you want to go with this?
Mama didn't give birth to you.
Say, this says...
Hmm. I was prepared for this, but still, what a pain.
I wonder what Mama is thinking.
What would I do, if Mama was planning to send me away someday?
How is Sana-chan doing right now?
Kurata-san!
it appears to be all that you are capable of saying.
don't play around with fireworks by pointing them at others.
--Ah, he's coming out! --He's charging through again!
In dire straits,
I've been waiting for an answer.
...up to now, just for today,
Next time on Kodomo no Omocha, Episode 18 of the "Relationships of Fate and Ramen" saga,
Whether you're awake or asleep,
Hayama Akito. I don't know whether he's my natural enemy or good friend,
but recently, when I'm with him, I feel relaxed.
Don't you lie to me! You're just a letch!
Good grief, I'm coming in! Get me something cool to drink, right away!
Maybe I should serve her some noodle sauce.
--Well, I wonder what that could be about. --Thank goodness.
Why don't you hide here for a while?
Huh...? Suddenly, I feel sleepy...
Wait! Don't fall asleep here!
I came in first in the race! Yay!
"When Gekidan Komawari had their first theatrical production,
and my daughter was chosen to play the lead,
My daughter came and told me this with great delight.
I love you, Mama! I love you!
Yes... Yes... I see. I thought so.
If it is all right with you,
Is that so? That might allow my daughter to feel better.
The press corps still has not left, and all.
for two or three days would be better, under the circumstances.
We blew it.
I don't even wear a brassiere yet.
Isn't she?
That's Hayama! That's Hayama!
You're right!
Mine are more unusual than yours.
Hayama...
I sure am hungry. Want to eat something?
Mm-hmm.
It's rare that these two can agree on anything, huh?
I don't have anything like that.
Come on, quit stalling.
--According to the information that we have, --What!?
"Person's weight"
Oh, I'm Zenjiro's manager, Higashiyamato Sanekichi--
I can't stand it! This has to be bothering the othuh residents!
I bid you good evening, people of Earth.
Zenjiro-san is not here. He has gone on a joiney.
--Zenjiro-san!
What are you doing, dressed up like that?
It shua can.
That was delicious!
That was good.
an8"Still can't sleep"
Be sure to brush your teeth before bed.
Hayama... I'm so glad...
And so, we now bring you the press conference
named Kamura Academy.
that's the home that takes in children that don't have any relatives.
with the place that took Sana-chan in for a month?
I will say anything about myself, so please, stop barging in on Sana-chan.
Naozumi! See here!
and the press conference came to an end.
It really was surprising, you know?
But I'm sure that Naozumi-kun did it for Sana-chan--
Tsuyoshi, I'm going home early, so tell the teacher for me.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
so BOY, take a look my way!
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
You can't ignore it either.
--but Sana-chan said that --Hey! What did you do that for, Hayama!?
--when Hayama-kun is around, --You perve!
--Well, okay. --Take this!
I'm done with her.
How come you didn't decide not to give birth?
Oh, then, you had her all by yourself?
Never mind that, there's something that I've been really wanting to ask you.
I'd better take a picture before I forget!
--"My friend is Tom." --She is trying not to laugh.
--"Tom is taller than him." --She's not at all serious.
She said she was going home for the day.
Sana-chan has made plans to see her again on Sunday.
She said she has a daughter... and Sana-chan...
What? From this distance, you can tell me directly.
You guys are walking weird, too.
...come on... pick it up... come... on...
Undercover?
Um...
Waugh! I won't say it again!
--Mawiko-chan knows about Cindewewwa. I wead about her in a book. --How cute! This little girl is my sister!
Keiko-san, thank you. I'm glad I got to meet Mariko-chan.
That...
it really frightens me. After all, if you hadn't... I wouldn't...
...be here now.
If you hadn't, I would have never met Mama... or Rei-kun...
No, not that...
Mama...
That night, I slept together with Mama.
Ah, Sana-chan!
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
...up to now, just for today,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
Feeling Good With a Sana-chan Quiz!
is true, yes it is.
Yo.
Sometimes I watch with her, so I'm out to win, too.
Ah, Sana-chan! We have a live broadcast of "Child's Toy,"
Hayama Akito... He started picking on the teacher,
Stop! Stop that! Stop!
Let her have it!
the best thing you can do is to hit your opponent in his weak spot.
Even you must be shaking, ready to say "Sana-chan, I give up!"
and finding out what his weakness is.
We'll use this to compare our voices.
I lost...
You'll be saying "Being alive is so much fun, I can't stand it!"
And so, Sana-chan was burning with enthusiasm over her drama.
You are such a thoroughly aggravating fellow!
Come on, let's get you home and in front of the TV. What time is it...?
A-chan...
So I take it out on Akito, and call him a devil...
Taking advantage of the confusion, Hayama-kun presses his button!
"Welcome."
--So, during the foist half, --Ah! Now that you mention it,
We are bringing you our special program, the "Feeling Good With a Sana-chan Quiz."
Sana-chan, are you leaving early?
I forgot that I had work! Farewell, my friends!
I want to talk! Rei, make sure you call me! I'll be waiting!
This is a trick question.
You called?
I see...
That was pretty harsh, going to the studio by yourself like that.
You know what? If you drink some juice, you might feel--
you will get 15 points!
--Sagami-kun... --Yes?
Rei...
Can I wait for you?
I get pretty embarrassed when I think about the way I was a little while ago.
despite the way I was, right?
I'll be all right, so...
Sana-chan is going for the win!
Obana.
to always go along with the scenario.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
is true, yes it is.
Sana-chan, I'm surprised you can converse like that.
"Huh? Kamura Academy? Right now?"
What is it, Sana-chan? Something the mattuh?
Is it okay for her to be skipping work?
You good boys and girls, don't stick your head out the window.
That's okay. It must be a long time since you've gotten away, huh?
What is that thing, Sana-chan?
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Hey, is Sana-chan really coming with him?
Yes. It's almost time for them to arrive.
--Director, do we look like her?
Okay, all of you get a handshake, as my present to you! Line up, line up!
What kind of defiant little kid is this!?
For what it's worth, I play as Kamurra.
Yeah? Naozumi-kun, huh?
--Ta-da! This is the first public showing! --That girl was here together with you, Nao-chan.
--Zenjiro-san, you're so naive. --Sensei, I want to do
but he still gives me some of his wages.
Help yourself to as much of whatever you like.
Welcobe hobe?
I ged id.
 Oh! I've come, come, come here, come to the sea. 
 Sana-chan is touched at this reception. 
 And so, as Sana-chan's present, 
 this is Sana-chan's first composition! 
If you step on your Nopia, it will break,
 I don't remember it, but there's no place like home! 
You forever continue to be annoying, you hag.
then the great star Kurata Sana-chan will completely lose face.
What was that, Sana-chan?
Akito-kun, what are you reading?
Okay, Ko-chan! I challenge you to a bungee jump contest!
Whoever's voice is the loudest loses this contest!
"I heard the neighbors put up a fence around their house."
There, I said it.
Who is Hayama?
How tall is that?
Sana-chan, him being your brother is fine and all,
--There is a gentle breeze between us. --It looks like Sana-chan is more concerned about that other boy
Look here, look here, if you want me to return this to you,
Come to mention it, that was exactly like what Hayama said.
Oh, my god! What is this! What is this?! Why?! Another fireworks attack!?
Shut up.
 Jan-jan-jan-jan, falling apart. 
--I'm glad I skipped work for this. --Let go, I said.
"Back against the wall."
My confessions are worked out long in advance,
he's there.
And our usual classroom...
No matter what happens, I'm retiring!
is true, yes it is.
when the children go home,
My former boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun. He's my chauffeur and manager.
Bring it on, Rei-kun. If I win...
Just as I thought. Sagami-kun you're...
Sagami-kun, you really are... you know.
I'm going to win! I'm going to win! I'm going to win!
Okay, I'll take that one. That's the game.
This doesn't look like a weird video.
I have... a favor to ask.
I want to take karate.
How does this sound?
...if you're going to pursue this, now's the best time.
 --The barbecue-cue is lit,  --I'm no good...
 --and there's juice.  --One order of corncob! --Okay, coming up!
I heard from Tsuyoshi-kun
I'm going to go watch his karate lesson tomorrow with Tsuyoshi-kun.
It really is a good job. Now that you're in the public eye, Sana-chan,
 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, please excuse me. 
I pushed her into making that promise with me,
I told you not to come watch me.
What does that have to do with it?
The rest of the world...!?
Whatever. I'm a busy person here, so see you later.
Okay then, time for a commercial.
can last in this kind of restrained training.
If you're going to observe, then do it a little more quietly!
--10,000 times, I hate it! A million times, I hate it! A hundred million times, --What's wrong?
because I am a child, you know! I'm in grade school! I'm a child!
With Sana-chan around, we can rest easy about the ratings!
H- hold on! Cut that out! Sana-chan! You dummy! Aah! You're on my--!
I didn't realize I'd been pushing you so hard up to now. I'm sorry, Sana-chan.
And he even took care of his dirty dishes!
Father, what in the world...!?
I will make it so that Sana-chan can spread her wings
I'll be in charge of her shoes...
N- nothing...
Give me a parachute! I'm getting out!
You mean it, Sana-chan!?
so here I am again.
--Sana-chan...
All right, I'll do this!
"Back against the wall."
...up to now, just for today,
Oh, what a fix, what a fix!
it's time to get out of there!
A one-step-above kind of Deluxe.
Oh, yeah, this guy is awful. Thanks to him, the story turned serious, ma'am.
You spread it around to everyone!
Don't go deciding... don't go deciding things for me without asking me, you damn hag!
 and girls have roads that they go down. 
So what!? Are you saying that Mama trying to work
See?
You don't have to act so surprised.
I love him.
Looks like you're making progress, huh Shinichi-san?
If you can't even solve those problems,
an8"Gomi is all alone"
Being all alone is... no fun!
What's the matter? Want me to bring home sushi again?
What's the matter? Has your makeup collapsed again?
--Gomi --ltami --and Kojima!
Now, listen here, Father!
H- he's driven you to tears, Mitsuya-sensei!?
by saying "it'll all turn out fine-fine."
No! No, he didn't! Akito-kun... Akito-kun wouldn't do something like that!
Shinichi-san...
As I remember, he doesn't have a mother.
Man, isn't that lame!?
but shoplifting water pistols? That's weak.
I thought it was hinky, malarkey, and Antonio lnoki!
...then it's no use.
Hey, what's with you!?
Hello, Shinichi!? You can hear me, can't you? Your father is busy.
If you don't want anything, then I'm hanging up.
Dad! I'm sorry!
Um, you should let the tea cool down a little...
Shinichi has always been physically weak, and prone to getting sick,
so in order to afford him a little latitude in his school life,
But these last few years, he has become quite healthy.
We really are terribly sorry for this. Good night.
I heard that Hayama-kun is going to Jinbo Middle.
This week's Sana-chan!
Well, just wait patiently. Now then, my quiz show is just about to start taping...
Zenjiro-chan, you've got a 100-hour wait.
--"Aah!?" --"Aah!?"
-- This is intolerable! 
--What?
Alarming! Alarming! Alarming! See here! See here!
Bye Bye Bye Bye
is true, yes it is.
"If you like, like, like me, kiss me!"
--Yahoo! I nailed it! I won! --You've stopped making sense.
are you sure it was okay for you to say that?
That game...
Don't use the show for your own poiposes!
She said we could go away together!
Sure you do. But Sana-chan is so busy, you know.
I'm all right here, and poor Mariko shouldn't be all alone.
The introductions have gotten put off, but this is Mariko-chan's papa.
You got beat up again, huh? Zenjiro-chan, you're pretty lousy.
Don't eat that! That's my lunch!
Where's your mama?
Mariko!
She's not here?
"Unworried by her parents' concern..."
The wonderful item that I purchased for just this sort of occasion.
--Over there! --This is terrible.
Mariko-chan!?
Now, calm down!
Mister!
Is this the image from the camera eye attached to the balloon?
A little more than halfway full is good.
Let's have some!
It's nice and light, and delicious.
You get just a hint of the sour plums mixed in with the tea and rice flavors.
Excuse me, I have to leave early to look for someone.
Shall we have seconds?
Mariko-chan! Mariko-chan, I'm coming to find you right now!
No way, no way, Sana-chan is too busy. Go on home to your mothuh.
What's that!?
I know not of her.
You don't have to eat those green peppers that you hate.
I'd like to help, but I'm just a tree.
Even though you're a tree, you haven't seen her?
She looks like an angel when she's asleep.
What's going on?
Aw, we couldn't decipher the Burutcha code the whole time,
After all, the code that Akito-kun deciphered doesn't make any sense.
You're sure?
Oh, there's a leftover make-out picture!? Sounds like fun!
"Kodomo no Odocha"
--Good morning.
we can't have any fighting. Wait here, and let's see what happens.
Sana-chan, it's still only September.
--Okay, let's go, Hayama! We're going to think positive, --Huh, me too?
 Those cute uniforms are a little embarrassing. 
What are you talking about, Scarecrow?
Children, good morning...
She's absolutely blue!
Sensei, how come!?
Our class test average is 15 points below the others.
That's right!
The test is in three days! Understood!?
The principal was good enough to gladly give his approval to this.
Hold on, Aunt-- Big Sister...
As a result,
Children, listen.
Everything we have studied up to now has been compiled on here.
 In fourth grade, I made a big splash. 
 Knowing this was bad, and trying to climb back out, 
 wanting to go to a country with no math. 
That's all. This has been the substandard,
"Zenjiro's 'Child's Toy"
Oh! I know!
See? Perfect!
I have to study!
Yeah, well, I got hypnotized by the math, and fell asleep, so now I'm panicking.
Say, Akito-kun, let's both help Sana-chan, too!
She can't do anything about her math, no matter what we try.
at this point, it won't do any good.
Whoo! For the first time in ages, it's Hard-Boiled Hayama-san!
You try anything, and this time, we're not going to take it sitting down!
Huh?
This is lame.
It's lame that all of us have to stay for after-school class.
--people say, happiness dwells. --I don't want to believe that Akito-kun is making threats against the teachers,
Oh, impressive, Aya-chan.
Oh, sorry.
But I saw him.
Sorry. But how could Hayama-kun do something so extreme again?
Make-out? I know I heard "make-out picture"!
Shut up! I never told any lies!
W-well...
You could say that... you could say that...!
This is bad. This is bad.
Hayama! Don't tell me you...!
--Hayama! --Akito-kun!
--Let's limbo!
Let's limbo goes on!
Do your math, too!
That's what you say about times like these.
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there.
meaning that you can't put the water back in the basin once it has spilled out.
I'm Kurata Sana, a 6th grader and TV personality.
Hisae-chan, who's sort of a traditional Tokyoite, and Mami-chan.
What is everyone doing over there?
Yes?
It's almost like you're Kurosuke's mother, Mami-chan.
It was my turn when Kurosuke left the nest,
Ah, class is starting!
Because that doesn't happen very often in Japan.
Hey...
What's the matter?
Did something happen to you?
Hey, Hayama, you're acting a little funny, aren't you?
Babbit has just arrived.
After... all... this... time...?
for the rest of her life.
Excuse me, it's a little to the left...
Oh, I see. I went home early, so you came because you were worried about me.
Sure you will. Kurosuke will be waiting for you, and all.
You say that, and I'm going to grow huge!
"Sana-chan thinks!"
Okay! Let me handle it! I know, how about xxxx-chan from xxxxx?
Hayama Akito-kun!
Yeah.
Hayama...
Today we're having our first in a series of poisonally experience with provoibs!
Yeah, I'm so pleased. Thank you.
and that if you can convey to them that you feel with them,
This week's Father Hayama.
Kurosuke, during the next art class, I'm going to the park to do sketches,
Sana-chan, Mami-chan...
Oh, how cute! Look, I drew someone playing the saxophone.
Let's go see!
I'm drawing an
Amazing!
There's something alive there in the middle, huh?
Over here!
Mami-chan!
--Mami-chan! --That's great, Mami-chan!
then you can hold it against me for the rest of your life, okay?
Can I give this to him?
Oh, is that right?
Hayama!
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
...up to now, just for today,
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
That rumor that I love you
is true, yes it is.
You got me.
Is there anything I can do? Ask me anything, Tsuyoshi-kun.
Mm-hmm. I already told Mitsuya-sensei, so it's okay.
How are we supposed to hang around with those oban hags?
Okay, does anyone have anything to say about themselves, and not just others?
Yes, Sana-chan?
No, that can't happen! Think of poor Aono-chan!
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Come on, come on, you have spell it out for her, or she won't understand.
Hey, Tsuyoshi,
I made it last night and put it on, but he takes it off by himself right away.
Shut up!
What time do you think it is!?
Come on, Piyoko!
Huh?
Can chickens do tricks?
Never mind you, Akito.
Say, did you see Aono's Piyoko? He's gotten big, hasn't he?
and I feel bad for keeping him on this cramped veranda.
Hayama!
Mm-hmm, if it's your house, Sana-chan, that's fine.
or I'll be fired!
Right.
but the flak you get out in the real world is harsh, isn't it?
"Ah, I'm so tired..."
Mayumi...
I'm begging you, be quiet, please!
I'm the same way.
we would like to perform this marriage for Piyoko. Drink up.
--Come get your roostuh! Hey! Hold up! Hold up! --Rei-kun! Rei-kun! Help, Rei-kun!
Shimura-san seems to be the only one in a good mood, huh?
Well, let's not dwell too much on it.
Sana-chan, I said before that you were perfect the way you were,
I can't take it anymore!!
Tsuyoshi-kun! Tsuyoshi-kun!
--Ran away!?
I've thought of a million ways to handle it,
Okay, Piyoko...
You didn't put me to any trouble!
Yaah!
to always go along with the scenario.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
when the children go home,
Okay, cut!
Are you okay, Zenjiro-sensei?
Lend me some money?
Mama forbad me to give you any, so I'm not going to.
searching for lake-bound dinosaurs!
We didn't order those!
We didn't order those, I tell you!
here to keep an eye on your uncle.
he's going to eliminate me on the spot.
Still, that much will be enough.
--Sure he is. I work with him --and be wearing this ridiculous costume!?
--to come work together with us. --and be one of Japan's foist-rate comedians!
There you go, pretending you don't know again.
R- really?
I don't know, I don't know...
--Well, you see... --This is gonna be good woik for shua.
He reminded me somehow of the way you looked when you were homeless, Rei-kun.
That's "walk in the park."
or whether you're a gagster,
if you want to improve your sensibilities, now's your chance!
"President's Office"
It doesn't appear that she has heard, Boss.
How about I put you to work at your first task here right away?
--I can't take this! --I can't take this!
Sana-chan...
-- If you're going to scoop up loaches,  -- If you're going to scoop up loaches, 
Tsuyoshi Chomp!!
His friend's business failed, and Ryosuke-san was the guarantor, that's all.
Well, that should clear up any doubts you had.
Right, Boss.
--The Yen Shop, Secret Organization.
The doll that Uncle gave me...
"Back against the wall."
I've been waiting for an answer.
Sana-chan, come visit us again soon.
...it's the season that the roasted sweet-potato truck comes around!
Oh, crap!
Rawr! Rowr!
"A cemetery visit with the Hayama Family"
This father and son still don't talk to each other much.
We came because Hayama invited us to come,
They must be.
He can't tell anything from that.
My name is Kurata Sana. Your little boy is a bit of a scamp,
but he's still a pretty good guy, so don't you worry.
...and as a result,
so she has been bringing love-love into everything she sees!
How was my pop acting?
You can't get an alligator stuck in your back teeth.
Is that right?
Yeah, you're right. I don't think it's that, either.
I will do it myself, and I'll be fine!
The reason for my heartfelt request has to do with Akito.
That was terrible, Zenjiro-san!
Bingo!!
--I don't know what your father is thinking, --that has terrible strawberry parfait!
--but suddenly he's in love-love. --Your father, who's not so young anymore,
Huh!? Dad has a girlfriend!?
--Huh? What?
Here.
Oh, it's Beautiful! Is that one of Mother Hayama's old photo albums?
Really?
and now you won't even tell one story to your son about his mother!
Sana-chan, we still aren't certain about that.
What should we-- should we-- should we-- Sri Lanka!?
We're going to make Shiori-san hate Father Hayama.
Yes?
Not to worry! Just call it my "Mission, Mark II."
Are you sure you'll be fine by yourselves?
and after all else, he suddenly snaps...
I'm mad!
I'm surprised at how well Sana-chan can make up such a silly story.
so now, why don't I tell some stories of my own?
Final weapon?
Once you see this last peculiarity about him,
He's a shocking father, our Father Hayama!
-- our Father Hayama!  -- our Father Hayama! 
-- father is a strange old man!  -- father is a strange old man! 
We're still over...
Natsumi, what is all this?
Well, of course it is.
Not me! I mean your marriage, Dad!
That is why you invited Shiori-san over here today, right?
I'm sorry, Akito.
I already said I was embarrassed, you know.
I remember the summer you were in her tummy, Akito-kun.
Thanks. As for the rest of it...
Hayama-san...
Akito-kun said he wants to hear the rest out of his father's mouth,
I see...
Shut up.
"Back against the wall."
But there's still half a day until the deadline!
S- Sensei, I'm touched!
I am Kurata Shizuka.
Grandma?
That was the year of the Barcelona Olympics,
who stopped by during his travels while compiling the History of Japan,
--Why has Mother suddenly showed up here once again? --Yes... Yes... That's right...
Dad! How can you be so carefree, like it was someone else's business!?
Here you are, sir.
This man is the Kusatsu Hot Spring Board Chairman's third son.
This is the Kusatsu Tourism Society President's second son.
The next gentleman.
Yes, hailing from Kusatsu, in Gunma Prefecture-
The next gentleman.
Okay...
If I were to take over Kurata Inn,
your precious 300-year history would be over in three days, Mother.
Does Grandma have something sneaky in mind?
Sana-chan's house is right around here,
Besides, Mama and Grandma seem to be pretty crabby to each other.
Well now, it appears that Mother has given up,
I've got a bad feeling, like something terrible is going to happen.
Lend me some money?
That was last week's "Child's Toy". This is this week's.
That's what we came here to find out, you know!
...the cook, you see!
You're going to leave Kurata Inn to Sana-chan?
Will you show me around?
Mm-hmm, Grandma.
Come to think of it, where did Katagiri-san go?
Katagiri-san...
This!
Why does this seem so formal? It's almost as though this were-
and watch "Child's Toy" every week, without fail, Ma'am...
Yeah, hotel studies? My grandma happens to run an inn in Kusatsu.
That's my mother's judgment for you! She's sharp! I approve!
What did Sana say? As long as Sana is okay with it, I'm okay with it.
That would be best. Want to sing, Toriyama-kun?
 Delightful, thrilling, pleasant and warm! 
Yeah, what bliss!
Good afternoon.
It seems like I've heard someone else say that somewhere...
Those eyes... aren't human...
I'm sure that Sana-chan will be successful in whatever field she goes into.
Huh? But Katagiri-san is going to be the head clerk, right?
We will see you later!
In dire straits,
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
Although I've said nothing but wisecracks...
My beloved Mama is a novelist. The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
My measurements are, starting from the top, 8-...
We're suddenly going to crash other shows,
Sana-chan, did you know about this?
Yes you have! See? See?
This girl here is the Kurata Sana-chan!
Okay then, with that, please be sure to watch "Child's Toy"!
they want to find an opening to intuhview him.
Little of this, little of that...
but for his work in dramas, too- Kim-Tak himself, Kimuchi Takuya.
Just embarrassed.
H- he's kind...
Yeah! No worries.
You're sure you're not worried, Rei-kun?
Sorry, but we're about to do a take. Bye.
You should just leave it alone.
but Asako-san hasn't seen Rei-kun at all. Takuya-kun sees her every day on location!
so I was thinking maybe I might actually meet her...
Is that right?
Oh no, I'm so nervous.
Hold on, what am I saying!?
Begging your pardon, but would you please let us snap a two-shot of you?
J- just a minute!
It's okay.
Shouldn't you be acting a little more prudent before the wedding?
Huh? Not me. Maybe you imagined it?
Click...
an8"It's dangerous to dance in the car"
"I'm glad to hear you say that, Asako-san."
I hear that Asako-san has a kissing scene in this drama.
My relationship with Asako is not like that!
The rumors about you getting married are true, then?
Well, uh...
Do I have to come with you?
Throw these guys out of here!
Come on, come on, let it all hang out and watch "Child's Toy"!
Sorry, Sana-chan, but would you take the train home today?
but I don't want to see you in any kissing scenes!
W- what!?
Mama! It's cruel to make Rei-kun watch this!
Nice working with you.
My fiancee is someone famous for being the queen of quiz shows,
Obana Miho-san.
I- I'm Obana.
I can't stand this! Hey!
Hey, can you see Babbit? Who exactly are you?
My heart may be settled, but my mind is in a...
...for two.
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
Hoy! In Sana-chan's next adventures...
I'm surprised that he even took a picture of Hayama kissing me.
My chauffeur, manager, and ex-pimp, Rei-kun.
Look at this picture of love-love.
--What do you mean, "love-love," you jerk!? --This late-night date between Kamura Naozumi-kun and Kurata Sana-chan...
Well then, just leave it alone- Gah! What? All of a sudden UFOs are shooting at me!?
but I am definitely going to get my scoop, Kurata Sana.
Gah! This is one positively nasty fellow who has appeared!
Safe driving?
 Move it, move it, Sana-chan coming through! 
 Naozumi-kun is just a friend from work. 
It's "nice to meet you," isn't it? Sorry about that.
Free entertainment reporter?
Want some coffee, Kurosaki-san?
Yeah? Kurosaki-san, you have children?
Is that the way you are by nature, Sana-chan?
This guy is a snake.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Good morning!
Not really.
Eh? A spare!?
Nyah! Take that!
an8"Ah, that was scary"
Sorry, but we're being targeted.
He's got a fever now.
That is unusual, huh?
What a coincidence!
Yes, and I know that you are seeing that actress.
H- how do you know that!?
Get it together!
Waugh! Something's passing over me!
Yahoo!
It's all right.
Hey, snake man!
Huh? You're not snakes...
Don't sell the stegosaurus short.
That's okay, that's okay!
Oh, it's the snake!
Were you trying to cajole the children into appealing for my sympathy?
You are so crooked! All you ever look into is the seedy side of people,
...we saw the family you are making sure to protect.
 ...ofu bread mixture in the pan, under high heat, and cook until it's crunchy. 
Pop, get painting!
Dad, thank you! Today has been an amazing day!
Kurata Sana...
Huh? You mean Tsuyoshi-kun's father?
Whether you're awake or asleep,
The chipmunk on her head is Maro-chan.
Tsuyoshi-kun, Aono-chan, and Mother Sasaki.
It can't be...
I- it's nothing.
That was delicious! I'll be home later!
Tsuyoshi-kun, are you sure you're okay with it?
They said "Aono's father is a bad man."
and so Aono is a bad girl, too.
First the divorce, now this business with the police...
It must be tough having to explain it to her kids.
You want to see him?
the "Mind your own business! Who asked you to help!?" girl.
Tsuyoshi-kun...
Once you snap, I'll chop you right away.
Tsuyoshi-kun, you can go over there once in a while, and before he snaps,
They may have split up, but the dad is still the dad,
Friendly chop!
That's why the old guy snapped like he did.
Why not?
What's the matter?
It's not a sandstorm, and it's not a typhoon, and it's not a tornado...
Dad!
The apples... were good.
Dad...
Hmm...
In dire straits,
...up to now, just for today,
I'm going to be honest and sincere,
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-totter,
I may be a little jumbled, but when I'm called on, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang!
My Aoki award-winning novelist Mama, and her chipmunk, Maro-chan.
The man who I declared was my boyfriend, Take-chan, a.k.a. Gojo Takeshi-san.
Hmm? Chocolate?
I'm sorry you had to see something so disgraceful.
Thank goodness Sana-chan is such a dense girl.
When Sana-chan made her remarks about Gojo-san, Hisae-chan was like...
That's right!
If you love him, you should be able to say you love him, huh?
Kurata's drive-by chocolating.
That's right, there's always that, huh? Kurata!
--Why!?
I don't have any chocolate.
Oh, I'm glad to hea-uh that.
Of course I am! Men live for their looks and their pride! And we bluff, too!
But I can't keep myself from smiling.
Well, I've got a drama taping with my boyfriend now, so bye-bye!
Yeah, I know! I'll make you to realize it!
I've heard that for a long time,
No, no, we've got no time left at all.
and the next one, and the next one, and the next one.
This train goes all the way to the ocean.

It always ends up like this. Always.
We were both weak people,
Uh, excuse me, Studio crew...
Now, let's move on to the body!
Attention all passengers.
--for a brief time. --Here it comes... Here it comes...
What's important is the present! Not to mention the future!
 Thinking about it wrong is just like doing nothing! 
I gave up on giving it up.

Okay, thank you for your lettuhs!

You guys didn't clean up, so get on out of here!
That's not good.
Because it was read.
Whose fault it is?
A- as it happens...
That's when the problem started.
It's their turn to do it, so they need to do it properly.
Gomi-kun, you really do like gomi "trash", huh?"
That's right, Sensei! That's right!
You were going to say you weren't any good at it, and push it all on me, huh?
Ha! You sure are old-fashioned and hardheaded!
And I'm not doing my hair up!
Like this!
Doesn't it somehow seem that this problem has doubled?
How so?
Once you get married, let the husband clean, and do laundry,
What? What? What? You've got a problem with that?
You came back!
What will these two's destiny be?
We can't have that!
Mitsuya-sensei, what is the meaning of this?
Okay then, girls, as girls...
Another thing that's weird is the way he cries as he plays the harmonica.
Aya-chan, what are you doing right now?
an8"Wall of the Sexes"
I think harmonicas are nice, too.
Makeup!
Alarming... this is beyond alarming!
So you see...
I declare! To split the room in half and hold class like this is unprecedented,
I knew he would say that.
And so, for today's lunch, we're having the roux sauce for curry rice!
The boys have as good as won this round!
"The two of them walk a thorny path"
Over here, over here!
"Thanks for the meal!"
Ah, you've got curry on the corner of your mouth!
Wow, how cute!
No fooling around!
Your garbage came over here!
Show these girls the spirit of Japan!
--Hayama-san!
We don't like to fight! This is all because the boys are wrong!
Your mother will!
Aw, look how much you've messed it up in here again...
The battle goes on for days on end!
Which means the girls get only noodles! That's too bad!
We're going to have Tarako spaghetti!
--Yeah! Yeah!
How could you miss a ditch this huge?
Hello, Sana-chan's school!
I got him! The girls win one!
Tanaka-sensei and Mitsuya-sensei, as well as?
At this point, it comes down to the final confrontation,
Yes, he is.
Goodness me...
Was this about the five-story pagoda!?
--Enough of this, you guys! This won't make for a good show! --Zenjiro-chan!
I've been waiting for an answer.
And here's Babbit.
There's Tobita Mayu-chan, right?
Tobita Mayu-chan is the one who sings hits,
Well, they're planning a 90-minute special,
Huh? You birthday is coming, Zenjiro-san?
Lucky! Happy! Ka-ching!
You are the elduhly boss of Kodocha Inn here, right?
Mayu-chan, don't let yourself be outdone by the other two.
Sorry I'm late, everyone. I'm Tobita Mayu.
Mayu-san, pleased to make your acquaintance.
Sana-chan, how do you do that!?
Nice to meet you.
we'd like to get started.

Who was it that came up with the naming "Shorokutai"?
Well then, that's settled.
Hmm, handmade, huh? I get the feeling I'm not too good
Of course!
Akito-kun?
Everyone from "Child's Toy" is coming.
What about the heroine role in the drama?
My word, to think that my Mayu-chan would receive this treatment!
an8"Envy"
Oh, and sneaking of yakimochi "toasted rice cakes",
Oh, hey, I'd love for you to come too, Mayu-chan.
My classmates would definitely like to meet you.
A dog?
Would you take this more seriously?
Just a touch of this...
Is that Zenjiro-san?
She's not here now, is she?
You've done it, all right.
Okay, "The drama rehearsal."
I'm terribly sorry about this.
Are you sure?
Okay, okay! I'm glad we made you a dog, Sana-chan!
the explosion of Zenjiro dolls went on,
Um, if it's okay with you...
Tonight is the party at Sana-chan's house. Aren't you going?
After many explosions, this is the finished product,
I have the ability. I got my current popularity because of my ability.
I'm not going to let that buffoon from Komawari run circles around me!
Oh no, you really are upset at me?
She's so silly.
That's what I was thinking when I came here to wait for you, Mayu-san.
No.

But I'm not jealous of them!

Don't you dare, Sana-chan!
He was just lured in by her.
Huh? I'm popular?
We don't need to hear about it.

No, I couldn't double-dip.

It's not surprising that his habit would return.
that Tsuyoshi-kun falls for any girl who gives him a present?
What's going on with Tsuyoshi-kun?
I'm not fit to go home with you right now, Aya-chan.
Ah, Sana-chan!
--Ah, don't push! Please let me by! --Wah! Sana-chan?
In that case, what will happen to Aya-chan,
At this point, the only thing I can do is appeal to this girl directly.
You know, to please give up on Tsuyoshi-kun.
 Indifferently, Tsuyoshi-kun wobbles that way, 
 even though he has Aya-chan! That's no good! 
Sana-chan! All right, let me take care of this! I'll try to find out who she is!
and thought "what's the deal with this guy?"
Cheer up. Here.
I want to go to a faraway land, where they don't have presents,
Good morning, Aya-chan!
Wow, what is it? Hurry and open it!
Still, this is great. The two of them are on good terms again,

 Kusatsu is such a nice place, come on by at least once! 
 Choina-sa no choina-sa no choina-sa no sa! 
I told you, I'm not going! It's obvious that nothing good will come of it!
I need to be prepared to become the head clerk at any time.
We're getting off. Get ready.
It's a secret.
Are you okay?
Ah! Rei-kun, Rei-kun, look, look!
What are you so excited about?
How is it being back in Kusatsu after ten-odd years?
Just the way it was after I left home to go to college.
an8"Obana Family"
You're kidding! What are you doing here?
Does that mean Hayama is here, too?
We got a call from the mistress here, saying she'd only charge us half price,
--the third one is... I don't remember... --This almost sounds like a wedding speech.
What are you doing?
Why don't you make up your mind, already, Mistress?
Just turn Kurata Inn entirely over to me, Kunisada Chukichi,
Hayama, with your karate and my Komawari steps,
Excuse me.
But I'll be in middle school next year.
It's not too late for you kids living near Kusatsu, so rush on down!
I'm going on ahead back!
Today is the day you give me a clear answer, Mistress!
this is my Grandmas precious inn, so...
Who do you think I am!?
Hey, you there, Mister, passing by! The acclaimed Kurata Inn is this way!
so BOY, take a look my way!
And our usual classroom...
...for two.

"Phew"
Mm-hmm, after all, this year's party is going to be...
 while mine is on March 7th. 
you don't mean you're already done!?
Wrong!
Zing!
--Hey, Yoko-chan, how are you? What are you doing for Christmas? --I'm going to bang out some good work today.
Isn't it obvious!? It's awlmost Christmas! And Christmas means a date!
I wind up my sideboins extra-coily, wear the suit I keep in resoive,
--Sana-chan! --You're married?
Sana-chan, here you are! You've got to get to makeup!
--Hoy! Hoy! Hoy! Here's your invitation to my Christmas plus middle birthday party! --Thank you, Sana-chan. --Wonder what I should wear?
Come, if you like. But do any bullying, and you'll have to leave at once, got it?
make sure you bring another one to give me just for our middle birthday.
Ah, what would be good? I just don't know.
Hey.
I...
...know... her secret.
Oh, this is a white-hot battle between differing fighting styles!
Either side could win this, and it wouldn't be surprising!
Huh? They're stopping? What about the three-way battle?

I- I'm sorry, Sana-chan!
So, when I think about how I really don't dine and dash,
Which kiss do you think is worth more?
It must be tough being an actress.
I hear that Kurata has a kissing scene in one of her commercials.
What!?
Whoa, how do you already know about it?
Don't forget, the reason this whole thing came about is because you screwed up!
...kisses you!
Sana-chan, come down!
but for some reason, I can't! I can't! I can't!
O- on the cheek, huh?
Whoops.
Even though it was work, I kissed her on the cheek.
...quick-changes into a merry-go-round...
A Heart-pounding Kiss at Christmas
Who will Zenjiro-chan's date be? Will he even find one?
Hey, Hayama!
...what kind of present should I buy her?
What is it you're looking for?
--This? What about this? --It's not nice to the touch.
an8"Fish paste"
How could I buy her flowers? I'm not Kamura, you know.
I know! A brassiere!
What company do you work for, anyway?
I have that party at Kurata's place.
What are you hungry for?
Christmas banzai! Mayumi!
Hey!
Would you figure out how a boy's heart feels, already!?
A present?
Kozue-chan? How does Christmas Eve look? Oh, no good, huh? I see...
What a lonely Christmas Eve this will be...
Hello? Sumire-chan? My name is Zenjiro.
Mother would like to join in, but- whoa-oa-oa...
You like dinosaurs, right?
an8"Just then, Zenjiro-san was..."
Stop taking so long to write!
I'm at Kamura Academy right now. Everyone else is here, too.
 Merry Christmas, we gather here tonight, 
Take this!
--Everyone at Kamura Academy sang a Christmas song for me. --Oh, he's so cool! I love-love him! Ah, bamboo shoots and red ginger!
--Were you abandoned? --That's dangerous, Sana-chan! He's a stray dog!
I wonder if that's all I am to her.
I wonder if the reason why she cares about me
If you love her,
Hayama...
Woo-hoo! A present from Hayama! Woo-hoo!
Hey! Who the hell are you guys!?
to always go along with the scenario.
I'm Kurata Sana,
Ups-a-daisy...
For example, something like this.
Could you stop fluttering around like that? You're dragging me down.
Oh, now that you mention it...
I- it's the queen!
Well, actually... In any case, to the palace!
Hey, hold on, now! Hey!
Ah, Tsuyoshi-kun... but then, if he becomes Tsuyo-moth...
Babbit-moth!
Here! This is where Maro-chan goes.
But I'm so glad you're unaffected, Mama!
So humans aren't Haya-moth's only victims.
You did it! Incredible! Incredible!
T- that's because we had on airbags.
I just played a little prank on the god of the forest.
--What kind of prank did you play on that god? --That's awful! It's making me cry!
Sana- I mean, Princess!
Freedom is great! And here I am, supposed to be afraid of heights.
Just a minute!
This has been Andoh-moth's lecture.
"Haya-moth keel-over spray"
Sana- Princess!
He won't get away with this!
 And now we've drawn Sana-chan! 
"School! I'm gonna be late!"
"I'm late for school! Rei-kun, take me there!"
"See here, boss monkey Hayama! Stop acting wild at school! Make them stop!"
"The school has been smashed"
Tax collector! Tax collector! Tax collector! Tax collector!
That's right! This is no time to be putting on this sort of screwy anime!

...up to now, just for today,
Whether you're awake or asleep,
Hayama...
I got kissed! I got kissed! I got kissed!
"Suddenly, One Day, I'm a Homeless Girl"
Whoa, everything in here, too!
Oh, Sana-chan's room has seizure papers on everything-
How can you say it so casually!? What on earth happened!?
You'll have to excuse my expressionless face,
Tell me, if you were to take a lady out on a date, what course would you select?
Let's see... Of course,
I'll never forget the taste of your Thai-style curry!
In life, there are mountains, and there are valleys.
Look! That will be the star you reach for, Sana!
 Even with nothing else, we still have our lives. 
Mister, come join us in our excitement!
 As long as we're alive, let's have fun. 
--I'm going to bed. --Hey, there's one more page. Tonight, I'm going to write 108 pages!
Happy New Year! This is a New Year's card from Babbit to all of you!
Just like that, the days went by,
Mm-hmm. It came out in the weeklies.
Ah, you're alive!
Mm-hmm, delicious! Shall we all share one?
Huh? Am I the only one who didn't know?
You've got bad taste, but I'm still glad for this.
That's the third one now.
I hoid you were having problems, that you were in trouble.
Uh, thank you. It will help to have something to wear.
That's why you're so fat!
 Then we stick six beans on. 
If there's anything I can do for you, feel free to ask.
Please leave!
to make sure you weren't having any problems, so that's why I'm here.
I am grateful for your concern.
Well, I don't know what to say.
Shut up! You're going to wake up Ayana-chan!
"And so, another morning arrives"
Sana-chan!
an8"Forgot something?"
Well, after all, it does represent your feelings, Hayama.
Now, see here! This is no place for children to be playing!

Why!? Why did that happen!?
Sana-chan, you're having some bad luck, huh?
Hello!? Hello!?
Why are only Sana-chan's appearances being cancelled!?
Sana-chan has absolutely no work.
What were you talking about!?
--Seconds! --Seconds!
Huh? It's empty.
Ah... don't fight. If you want, the two of you can eat my croquette.

It's working! It's working! It's working!
It looks like Sana-chan is finally getting down to business.

Look! Here! Here!
Sana-chan, now what is ill?
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I have to write! I have to write! I have to write!

Oh, and are you Aya-chan? You're seeing Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
We don't need any guys. You can just pipe down.
and Aya-chan is graceful and modest,

I would have had to write about what Hayama is trying to get past.
I'd like Mami-chan to understand that, too.
 It was myself, too-la-loo-la-loo. 
You're kidding! You still haven't talked to Mami-chan!?
Sana-chan, hang in there. We're behind you!
You know, Sana-chan is pretty worried about you.
Having bullied Mami-chan has also become a scar on Akito-kun's heart.
I've been expecting you.

There are many reporters gathered here-
'Course he's not.
You're not father and daughter!?
Sana-chan, not bad.
You guys are persistent, too.
Okay, our couple with the gossip about them, we're about ready to go!
Okay, this is a take! Start!
But isn't the 30-year difference in your ages a bit unnatural?
It's not as though I'm going to be in elementary school my whole life.
I'll be in middle school soon?
But everyone else's parents will be coming, right?
You just need to listen closely to what your teachers tell you.
You'll go to Kaimei Middle School too, same as your brother.
That's okay.
Still, I'm impressed that he's made up your mind to.
Nothing.
A picture of Principal Narunaru's head!
This is dumb.
Sana-chan, you're late.
Since my mom can't come, this is Mama Mk II!
All right, here goes.
This is an alarming matter!
I cannot go along with her attending Jinbo Middle School!
I guess he might have been talking about Andoh-sensei.
Achoo! I nevuh said anything!
Huh? They disappeared!
I never! How dare you say such a thing!
I...
Take-chan, you're so warm.
That's in bad taste.
You're pretty good.

You can't ignore it either.

He'll be coming starting tomorrow. Is that clear, Shinichi-san?
There must have been something that happened!
 That's too much for Mari-chan, hideous to Hide-chan! 
We don't have a video deck, so let's watch it closely now, with our naked eyes.
--Oh, did you notice the slight pratfall I did at the end? --Just a minute.
By any chance?
Shinichi-kun...
Well, continue, if you please.
I'm going to tell you this flat-out-
What will we ever do?

Principal, dispense a harsh punishment, if you please!
That's right. If Tsuyoshi-kun believes Hayama-kun, then so do I.
I'm so glad you didn't turn out like that, Shinichi-san.
If your mother ever heard that you had done something like that, Shinichi-san...
If I had done something like that?
That shaggy Watanabe kid, in 2nd Class.
What!? You mean, Hayama-san wasn't the one who told everyone!?
What went on? Tell me plainly everything that happened, Hayama.
...then it's no use.
Dad! I'm sorry!
I'd like to make a crack here, but I can't.
I'm sorry.
Shinichi has always been physically weak, and prone to getting sick,
We probably shouldn't have done so.
I believed him.
I heard that Hayama-kun is going to Jinbo Middle.
It shua is rough being an extra, huh?

Good morning.
Tsuyoshi-kun, you can look forward to tomorrow.
I'd like to pound his face.

Well, I've got a drama taping with my boyfriend now, so bye-bye!
Sana-chan, I'd be happier getting a single chocolate from you
Hey, isn't he here yet?
Have you gotten "seriously ill" again, Take-san?
Oh, no...
No, no, that's not what they mean. Apparently, he's prone to absenteeism.
This is bad, Take-chan...
We're pushing it as it is, so we can't.

Yeah, is that right?

I'm always, always watching you. You look so handsome when you're playing tennis.

I'd like Mami-chan to understand that, too.
You know, Sana-chan is pretty worried about you.
So just wait there for her, okay? And be sure to come to school tomorrow.

Hmm? What's this? This was stuck in there!
No, I didn't do anything. Goodbye.
I seem to have found some courage.
Oh, Daughter!
I'm going to talk to Mami-chan, and tell her exactly what I feel. Mm-hmm, I've got to.

Wait just a minute.
The truth is, Misako-san is trying to think of what to say next.
Oh, Mama, you're telling us something we already know quite well.
Usually, she would have gone up the stairs.
Thank you, Sana-chan.
Early to bed, early to rise, eat right and stay regular!
Aah! A man older than me just called me "Mother"!
That takes some nerve, huh!? Even I haven't called you that yet!
Uh, Sensei?

Say, Take-chan, they said they were going to do physical exams

Sana-chan has a penchant for bringing men home with her.
Hold on, Zenjiro-san, you make it sound disreputable!

Nothing much. Just a prolapsed stomach.
Really? That's terrific.

You can tell your big brothuh here, right? Tell me, okay?
Come on!
I don't even have it!
W-well...
You've got some snot coming out.
I- I've become like the despised teacher in a young adult drama...
S- she's on fire...
Hayama! Don't tell me you!
Not really.
I know this is sudden, but here's a Sana-chan drawing song.
 And now we've drawn Sana-chan! 
A thorny path!
This certainly is a thorny path. Ow!
Oh my, Boy A...
Don't you "huh" me!
Which is why I spelled it out for him clearly that one time.
W- what? Him, too? Hey...
I guess not.
Mm-hmm. Oh, is he planning to play his trumpet next?
Easy! The night kept going on!
--Whatever happens to Sana-chan
--We're talking about who Sana-chan is close to, right?
--Aya-chan...
Zenjiro-sensei!
She's taking it out on the others, too.
Sagami Rei finally makes his appearance! Finally... finally...
Ah! My middle school uniform has arrived!
It's all DAIJO-BU DAIJO-BU
Bye Bye Bye
and your body will be healthy,
so resolve when to give up
U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI U-MAI

and all the new experiences.
Good morning, Shimura-san!
It was a dream?!
Sana-chan! What are you doing, why are you so slow?!
Do you want to be late on the first day of school?!
Your voice is so loud that you caused me to cut my bangs too short!
How can you act like this in front of the TV viewers and say such harsh words!
Lady, you're gonna be late on the first day of school.
This is it...
I'm Kurata Sana, 12 years old, I'm an actress.
I'm attending an escalator school where most kids come from its own...
Shinohara Tomoe-chan!
But the TV station asked me to come, and the producers told 'me' to come.
The two of you are dancing as well.
Uh... Sana-chan... You cut your bangs?
- You cut it like a monk. - That's true.
Aw, I'm in class 8, really far from you.
I brought my camera too.
And the gang from sixth grade class 3. What changes will happen to them?
I cut my bangs too short this morning.
Excuse me, please find the differences between the two. I'll give you 15 seconds.
Um... Kurata-san, we'd be really glad if you gave us an autograph.
Yeah... I do wish I could be treated just like a normal person.
You two, what makes you so much better than others?
an8Do you understand what's going on?
Do you understand? You wussies!
Don't try to talk like me!
I don't know why I'm getting angry.
It's the homeroom teacher.
It doesn't suit you.
No, no, no, my mortal enemy.
Hmm... Hayama?
Um... Sana-chan, please stop them.
What's wrong with you?!
That's really stressful.
...and her face is just like mine.
It's not love, it's not hate.
So in the end, what are you to me?
Ahh really? Thanks.
How do you do?
Really... You're Hayama Akito?!

My former boyfriend, Sagami Rei-kun.
The mysterious white bat straight man.
Sure.
Sana-chan just left on her own, heading back to Tokyo.
--No fair, going off and having fun by herself. --She told me she was gathering material.
Sagami! Take care of everything, okay?
all alone with my former boyfriend?
Sana-chan!
Re-write the script?
Cutlet-and-curry!
All right, cutlet-and-curry! Okay, okay!
"Siht htiw yako uoy era"
When Sensei gets home, I'm going to have her give her a stern talking-to.
A hunch, huh?
Yeah, well, it just doesn't make any sense that they are lovers.
Is this for real!? Did you really stay the night?
We've started a Gojo-san fan club!
And the inauguration party is going to be held at Gojo-san's place!
Akito-kun...
Butterflies come flying in,
with tails growing out of their behinds.
an8"That time with Sagami-san..."
Ah, Hisae-chan, I've been expecting you! Come on up to the eighth floor.
Sounds like Sana-chan is treating it like her own house.
"The party has started..."
A- Akito-kun...
Meat! Meat! Meat! Where's the meat!?
For seasoning, it's Sana's special sauce!
Wow, these bubbles are amazing!
The bubbles... the bubbles... the bubbles are attacking me!
I see... So Gojo-san lived here up until thirteen years ago, then?
Keiko?
Oh, yay!
Yes, the whole time.
She's been going to school from this Gojo-san's place,
A new home is so nice! It's all shiny! Everywhere you look, it's all shiny!
She's late, huh?
Okay, I'll come by again some other time.
Bye Bye Bye Bye
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...

Right.
That's right, it's this face.
So Fuka and Hayama went to the same kindergarten?
But then came sixth grade and everyone was talking about their first kiss.
It says the average age for the first kiss is 16.4 years old!
Yeah... Takaishi-kun?
...and who knew Takaishi-kun would move to another city!
an8Ludicrous?
Where did that chart come from?
This is too sad, it's all Hayama's fault.
Kindergarten again today, boring.
My name is not Buka, it's Fuka!
It's so great!
What? What?
Hail! To the great manager!
Then what?
I can't hear you. If you've got something to say, can't you say it louder?
Geez, you're a nice guy as a friend...
Eh, what's your name?
What?
The answer is irritated.
If he sees anybody he doesn't like, he'd just torture them even more.
- Right? Apologize, Akito-kun. - No.
I'm gonna destroy you!
- Here... - Thank you, lady.
That's really nice of you.
Akito-kun won't be in any clubs either because he has karate.
Aside from Indian curry, there's all kinds of curry.
Auku?
Don't read what other people wrote backwards!
You're wrong.
What do you mean?
I called him.
I'm sorry, Fuka.
You ok?
I was surprised to hear that you were in middle school already.
So you won't come to school once you start shooting on location?
Hey! Hayama Aki!
She's the one who approached me without knowing me. It's her own fault.
You have a point there too.
What was that look just now?

Interesting means having a good impression of the other person.
Maybe Hayama has comedy potential and she noticed it!
Sana being clueless about love hasn't changed.
Devastated Mama.
Akito-kun... Everyone who is eating, sorry for the trouble.
Hayama-kun, but can you take a picture for us?
Sorry, Akito-kun.
I will be alone with Sana-chan today!
Later.
The director is Ono Miki or something...
No one can do a love story better than him.
Really?
Yeah, that's what Rei-kun said.
Thank you.
if you don't keep an eye on them, they'll grow apart...
You're so worried about Hayama-kun. You're so considerate.
- Fuka, get behind me! - Why?
Yeah.
Give it back!
Give me back my octopus sausage! Give it back!
octopus... tastes really good... yep...
Rocket Punch!
My name is Ishida and by the way I'm in Class 2.
The truth is I...
Sana-chan!
How do you know?
Sorry...
Well... ok... but how do you feel about Akito-kun?
Didn't I already say that I didn't know?
That's what I wanted to ask you...
The right part of my body is getting a weird electric shock.
Even dead, we can meet...
Ghost? I'm one...
I'm playing a ghost in the movie...
Didn't know about you two...
Why does everybody immediately assume that?!
At sixes and sevens.
You're really strange!
You're weird! Taking a toy out like that!
I never heard this before!
We only want to act well in our own roles, right?

Sana is like a different person.
Boy and friend means male friend, right?
We're not really dating...
True, true, no wonder Sana-chan's angry...
But I heard from the producer Naozumi-kun's role is more important.
Watch out...
The movie... after it starts filming...
Sensei! Keep this up and we can make our deadline!
She's like a ghost member.
Did you memorize all your lines?
What are you talking about?
She said she was very embarrassed with her illusion of love.
Akito-kun, are you running away?
Is someone there?
Ah! Why is there someone hanging around right here?
Akito-kun, where are you going?
Sana-chan is leaving this week...
Did you give me this?
He says he loves me... l'll feel very guilty if I refuse without a reason...
It feels like I'm standing on top of a cliff!
Really, so that's how the public looks at me and Naozumi-kun...
If you're really going out with Kamura Naozumi, please tell me...
I wish for your happiness!
So embarrassing, farewell!
The correct answer is, circumstances may justify a lie. Study hard.
Actually, that's really Andou-sensei's phone number!
What are you standing there for? Are you having diarrhea?
- No. - Why?
- You worked really hard. I guess. - Yes.
Alright, let's go!
I'll do my best on the movie too.
Ok, I got it. You'll tell me when I get back, right?

Yes, sir.
The problem is food, food.
Am I right?
My future depends on this movie.
Admirable actress.
If you're like this, they are going to think Naozumi-kun is better than you.
Ah?! That's great, I'm relieved.
It's been a long time since the last time I wore a kimono.
This week's Sana-shan.
This is a scene when Hiroto was wandering in the forest and then Mako appears.
Get ready... action!
Hiroto, look at Mako.
Ah... so this is what it means to be away from civilization.
Right, right, that was me.
...and then another arrow for the other eye...
You can't add vinegar in sushi and you have to use banana flavored tooth-paste?

I have something to tell you.

What was that about?
Shibuya, Harajuku, Tokyo bus station, restrooms... I don't know exactly...
It's your fault... He told me he likes me, but made another girlfriend...
This makes me so mad!
I want him to feel how it is...
So please help me?!! Huh?!
Let Takaishi-kun see how cool you are...
Cool? Few words?
Akito-kun...
She likes to say interesting things...
- If I promise something... - Usually doesn't come through.
I'm fine, I haven't changed at all.
Rock, paper, scissors...
Staying in this posture is tiring...
It can't be... they're pretending to be dating and we are too...
Don't you want me to say it this way?

What do you guys wanna eat? I'm fine with anything.
Others are fine.
That's also the steak!
- The fries are good. - The steak burger is not bad either.
- Fuka... - Takaishi-kun...
It happened in kindergarten!
Dummy!
So there really wasn't any problem between you two?
No such thing. I'm rather good looking.
You're not important to me anymore.
I'm sorry for making you do this especially when... there's a girl you like too.
It's Sana...
I told her that when she gets there she had to keep in touch no matter what...

In other words, I'm never going to admit I lost!

Good work.
But...
It's okay. We're just getting a glimpse of it.
Do you mind?
Oh! Kawai-san is in the lead.
Adult's love... I don't get it.
The director made us do it so many times because we were both so nervous.
But... but... but he's totally different from Rei-kun!
Used to it?
Girls who don't wear bras are normal!
Kinoshita-san, please take care of them.
Sana-chan's weird.

Someone must've done this on purpose.
Locals?
You silly poses make you look even worse!
I didn't mean it like that.
We've discovered Zenjiro's new lover...
What the hell is this?!
Right?
What are you saying...?
I hope you understand.
If he continues to ignore this, he won't be able to get out of it!
Of course it's not ok.
So why?!
Even thought it does matter...
Ah, it's nothing!
Even though this may cause more problems.
But if it's true love, probably...
She is so extreme!

Is this happening around her?
I heard that Sana-chan had a fever.
Amayah...
Backwards?

Hayama.
This says they're lovers.
Because she had a relationship with Naozumi-kun, she turned me down.

What would you feel like, Sana-chan?
People who watch will feel something.
How is everyone? Is Fuka well?
What the...?
- Others cell phones won't. - Others?
But if you use it in this place it works without reasons.
Eh? Oh really?

Matsui Fuka, best friend I met in the bathroom with a Western accent.
Huh? Rei-kun...
But this time she really lost her spirit.
Anyway... we'll have to get going with the rest of the scenes without Sana.
I want to be ready by then.
Even so... What method should I use to cheer her up?
I can't even cheer her up! Why am I so useless?
Least expecting... Who could that be?
What's going on? Everyone seems to be stressed out.
Ah... It is coming closer.
Something is falling down.
Ah, Sagami! Long time no see. Thanks for your phone call.
Only you can save Sana-chan now!
- You mean 'hanging around'... - I know that I must forget quickly
Hayama is going out with another girl. Stop it!
Naozumi comforted her, but Sana-chan is still depressed.
Keep it to yourself!
I'm still in love with him.
I see. I don't need to change anything.
He sounds like an example of a good editor.
Huh. I can't do it. Not even this morning.

I'm very happy that you confessed to me. Thank you.
You worked so hard on this!

The mansion that everybody built is going to be burned down tomorrow.
Mama! Calm down.
Please don't scare me. I thought you were taking Sana-chan home.
I'll tell you something.
If something happens to Sana-chan, I'll let you try sky diving without a parachute!
Feels like a different world, doesn't it?
I think it's about time to go back, right, Onda?

I've learned it.
I have to go, no matter what! Activity! Activity!
I brought a new member.
Hello, everyone. I'm Kurata Sana, from Class 8.
Fuka really is perfect.
- Strange... - Strange?
I wanted to ask you something.
What is it?
I'm so tired...
Because I've been watching Akito-kun and Sana-chan grow up together since 6th grade...
But what?
Ah, it's morning.
- Going home already? - I'm hungry.
Akito, you opened your button again.
Akito likes to parade his superiority...
Ishida?
And we couldn't get in touch with you either...
Sana...
When you sing this song, your worries will go
Tidak apa apa, Nday kambay kambay
It's all crazy over there,
blur2.667oteage kimemasho
Naozumi-kun is on television...
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
I always feel Relax,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay!?

Absolutely no one can catch her.
Thanks guys.
...because it's printed in magazines.
Well... Akito?
...but whatever you're thinking, I have no idea.
Why are you running away again?
...and when the article came out saying that...
What? No way! You just ran all the way home to get this?
I squashed two people on the road.
What?
I don't understand why you're so moved?
Isn't this nice? Isn't this nice?
The taping of the show... we haven't been there for a while.
Does that mean... Naozumi-kun is here also?!
I don't care what they write.
Our relationship...
...and Hayama-kun getting a girlfriend...
Sana-chan, it's about time.
You've turned bad.
Why? Why?
It's impossible to act together!
"Butt" is over here!
He came jogging by on that morning to see her off before we went on location.
So that sums up...

And it's being broadcast nationwide!
Rei-kun!
See, you don't know anything!
So this is your true face, Naozumi-kun?
So it'll be okay as long as you don't run into him, right?
As long as I don't run into Hayama I'll be fine... and his classroom is far away.
Hey Fuka, what did you do last night... around 10 o'clock?
Sana, really there's someone you like?
Who can it be?
You can't believe all these rumors!
I didn't sleep all day yesterday...
No, wait... let go of me!

Have you ever loved someone?
...like yesterday on TV...
...because you're the one I like.
I only realized it when I was out shooting the film!
Really you feel that way about me...
Yeah, it just slipped out. It's embarassing...
I'm just not normal!
You liking me is in the past.
Oh, you're still here.
News! News! Excellent news!
Hey, is that really true?
Sensei!
I want to be away from those two.
Oh, Tsuyoshi-kun, what's up?
You won't come to school again?
Sana-chan...
Is that so?
Hey, but you're the one who told him everything.
Did you mean the show?
Yeah.
Then, I should do the same.
You wanna go visit the cemetery?
That won't work. Be strong.
She finally looks more cheerful.
This schedule looks like one that a super star uses.
Crying, Rei-kun?
I feel so weak.
Hey, Naozumi.
Ah... This week's Sana-chan!
Not at all.
That hurts!
Don't worry about the things in the past, okay?
Bye-bye, Hayama.

My name is Kurata Sana, first year junior high school student.
...at that time...
This is no time to daydream, stupid.
It's here, it's here.
I can't take it anymore. I'm in a lot of pain.
Sana.
Sorry about that.
Wonder what she's doing...
But Shimura-san said "She comes home late every day because of work".
You're brothers... Aren't you two here to kill me?
Akito.
Do you want to go watch Sana's movie tomorrow?
I'm going with Tsuyoshi-kun tomorrow, want to go together?
Akito-kun, we're still Sana-chan's friends.
Time's up.
You look different from before.
Cute...
...is for Sana-chan...
...and also Naozumi-kun...
Why? Because it's in English! English!
Then just find someone who understands English.
Hi... Sana-chan... Naozumi-kun!
I'm Talandalu. Long time no see!
What's wrong, Mr. Talandalu?
Number one producer!
Put it on the shrine! There's no shrine?
Congratulations again!
I, Talandalu, will support you from the bottom of my heart!
That's true... it's great news...
Guest...
Because...
Sana-chan, everyone's here...
...still thinking about him.
Hey, hurry up.
Water Palace was the greatest.
Mama...
Even though it's going to be very challenging work...
This is unbelievable, I'm going to say goodbye to Sana-chan today!
Because there's been a change of plans, Kodocha is gonna be changed!
There was a rumor that middle-aged women think of me like a toy...
Get back soon!
It's always the same old nonsense,

We're gonna arrive at the John F. Kennedy airport very soon.
We made it to New York, huh?
I'm in New York.
Right now we're over here right?
So be careful everyone.
The flight from Japan to the JFK airport doesn't have an evening flight.
Put away your trumpet now.
That's the president's White House, isn't it?
White House isn't in New York.
It's in Washington DC.
Oh maybe because we don't speak the same language.
Babin babon.
But this book says she's the queen of Broadway.
Hayama? Who's that? Your boyfriend?
Sana-chan, what just happened now?
Ahh! Hayama-kun!
If he were Hayama, "Akito, do you like sushi?", "I don't hate it."
If he were Brad, "Brad, do you like sushi?"
Oh I'm just a little embarrassed right now.
Huh, what was that?
From here on are Maeda-sama, Sagami-sama, and Kamura-sama's rooms.
Alright then me too, goodnight.
Tomorrow we'll do our best, ok?
Because in my family we have a servant and her name is Shimura-san.

Time for pictures, don't move!
Sana-chan! Naozumi-kun!
We can only assume that.
I'm really sorry, I can't say anything.
I'm really sorry!

A ghost.
Ghost?!
But the travel guidebook doesn't say anything about it nor what to do when one appears!
What's wrong with everybody? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Actually, Ramsy-san... there's a matter which is very uncomfortable.
Ramsy...
We can't just leave the situation like this! Since I have nothing to do anyway...
Sure...
Ahaha... I'm very sorry...
Yeah! It seems that Maeda-san ate something called Manhattan at the airport...
All right then, I'm running late for my plane so... Bye!
Sana-chan...
It's like coming to Broadway and becoming the main character of a suspense drama.
Yeah... although it hasn't reached 10 yet...
Hey Michelle, are you serious about this? These two babies are actually movie stars?
Everyone! Better look carefully!
First you draw one mountain...
Hey? Hello? Excuse me? Doctor hey hey?
Hmm... well...
Just say "No problem"!
Why? What are you doing here, huh?
What kind of joke is this?!
We came here because of the musical, not just for ourselves.
If I should see them?
Naozumi-kun...
It's kind of strange...
Michelle-san...
It's not that...
Yo!
It was nothing, your flat chest leaning on my back made me feel really fortunate.
It could have been a coincidence...
Yeah, let's turn in early tonight then.
Sana-chan, be careful and remember to lock your door, ok?
Thanks.
This can't be...

This...
Someone has their eye on us.
Why do we have to have this 'angry but can't express myself' feeling?
My name is Ramsy.
New York is sure full of puzzles.
Anyway, you won't be able to use this room as it is.
Mr. Makubanban!
Isn't there a saying that one who's drowning will even eat straw?
If we investigate closely enough, the culprit will reveal himself,
What is all this noise about?
Mama, could you introduce us?
Right, Mama?
Because our rooms are a total mess.
I'm glad, too.
Don't you have an early morning meeting with the stage manager tomorrow?
And a rehearsal after? Why are you still running around this late at night?
Sicil, you too.
Meeting them isn't good for you.
Ever since the first time I saw his picture in Daddy's room, I thought he was very handsome.
I took a photograph from Daddy's files, don't tell anyone, Brad!
The male lead Peter will be played by Harrison Hanks.
I hope you can play this well, but don't break the stage.
Please go home, old man.
Yes!
No matter what it is for...
Too exhausting!
It's your own fault. You're the one who said to treat everyone around us as enemies.
A big fat biscuit, line, line, triangle, heart plus wings and you get Babbit!
You must be Naozumi Kamura.
One, two, one-two-three-one...
Fly!
What's up with you two? You look deflated.
Go back to Japan. Or else...
That something like this should happen while I'm gone!
What?
Naozumi-kun...
Of course life is important.
We thought it was that ghostly girl but she's Hamilton's family.
It's not Sicil's fault.
We will do our best on stage.

I have tickets to go back to Japan if you still need them.
A little while ago we decided to do the musical whatever happens...
Yo!
You already recognize me.
Many things happened after I met you! Who is targeting us?!
A little cold maybe, but it looks quiet at least.
Folk dance is a fun dance
If you have a fever your face turns red
I already went to two places. I told you it's not easy to find a good one!
Yes?!
Wow, Naozumi-kun, beautiful!
I would like to laugh about it...
I made it all by myself! It's great, isn't it?
Mama hates girls who can't dance.
I hate you just the same as my mother! I hate you!
Seems you can take care of some things.
You're in the way! Leave us and go back to Japan!
Thank you. We will certainly make this musical a big success.
Idiot! Next time I see you I will have tomato ketchup
Ah, thank you, mister! I am Kurata Sana. Huh?
Yes. And if I may ask, you are... ?
Looking for an apartment, right?

Excuse us, we'll return now.
You owe me an explanation.
Why did you attack Naozumi and Sana?
That's why I was pushing them out in your place.
Thank you.
This boy doesn't accept ornaments at all...
Naozumi...
Yes...
But to have to hear your hungry cries was painful.

I'm not thinking that.
It's better than having her eat nothing.
What's up?
No, it's good work.
No, I'm sorry. I don't feel like eating.
That's not good...
Oh, I have to go to the shop.

If you force her to come back her heart will close up like a shell.
Take care of Sicil, Sagami.
Shopping! This is the first time I've ever gone to the supermarket!
I thought we should meet, and see what happens.
I thought I may as well listen to what she has to say.
Hurry up, get out quickly! It would be disastrous if he saw us together here!
It's my own business. I went through a lot of trouble to set this all up!
Mother.
When we first meet I felt that you were my mother.
I'm sorry, something got into me.
Even if it's just knowing that my mother is alive. I'm happy about that.
Thank you! I'm so happy!
Mmmm, this is delicious. You are great, Bernie.
It was the same with me. I knew right away.
Sana, Naozumi! Legs higher!
Yes!
Thank you for waiting!
I made up my mind to stay here.
Is it that good?
Ah, Sicil!
That's the way. The meat will be tender if you cut it up in small pieces like that.
Wow, Michelle's lesson was intense.
Especially after Gary-san left.
With all that happened I can finally feel relieved.
Hey you! Why did you come here? Get out of our way!
You just shut up.

That shouldn't happen. That's something important, right?

I will never forgive you for all the things you did...
Wait a minute, I'm too angry, my face is getting all wrinkled.
An actress's face is her life... I won't yell anymore.
Let's change this ugly face you have on.
No matter what.
Has Naozumi lost his way?
I'm very worried.
Hi! I'm Sagami Rei, are you Naozumi-kun?
His manager was in the hospital due to food poisoning, but he'd come out soon.
Oh, I see.
Ah, but I'm not a stranger.
Hello? Ah, Rei-kun!
You're too naive, you bastard!
Ah, you're awake?
You just rest, I've already told your manager. Sorry...
It's very good.
...you think the soup I made is good.
An actor doesn't mean a foreigner.
Good night, Naozumi.
What is it?
Y-Yes.
But now I am very grateful to him.
What are you saying? I'm his mother, I should be the one thanking you.
Please don't tell Sagami-san and Bernie about Sicil.
About that...
Please do.
Oh yes, she's Naozumi-kun's mother.
Ah, so that is the case.
One is nearly late, the other has a cold and needs to rest.
A missed beat there!
They... All they're interested in is other people's children.
No crying!
Don't ask me, I'm disgusted just thinking about it.
Why? Why does a thing like this happen to my child?
I don't want a child who cannot dance, I don't want her!
Even though many things happen every day...

We need to escape, both of us.
He rescued me when I had my heart broken.
What?
Because you're here to support me.
I'm sorry. Many painful things have happened because of the incident with Naozumi.
I was thinking that Naozumi would be welcome to live together with us.

She loved the stage and drama more than me.
Immediately, I started investigations and that's how I found out about your existence.
I was sure that you would succeed the same way on Broadway's stage.
Well, I talked to Sicil a little about this.
That's rude, Gary-san. How can you say that with such confidence?
There's a problem.
Crying, laughing and steaming, sticking your tongue out
I have a hundred faces, makes me so happy!

Say it already!
Well... err... today's weather is good.
What is it?
What are you talking about, Sicil?
Papa and Mama no longer want a child who cannot dance.
That's right, Sicil.
There are other replacements which I can easily find. There are a lot!

Naozumi-kun, are you still awake?
She's such a reckless woman. It makes me so mad.
How embarassing for you, you've failed, haven't you?
You idiot!
You're crisp as a radish chip today.
What was it?
Me too.
Hurry up and get ready!
Just now.
Gone sight-seeing with Bernadette-san.
That was quick.
I'm Kurata Misako.
Sensei! But your promised you'd start writing as soon as you arrived.
There's tea too.
He doesn't have an adult's taste.
Naozumi!
Naozumi-kun, are you ready?
Broadway standards must be pretty far above theirs.
No, there is no difference in their ability to move an audience.
You dreamed about it? You must've been pretty nervous.
Yeah. I dreamed I fell on stage and then jumped around by myself.
I can't move.
In the end you'll fail too.
No, I'm not. I'm going to buy some popcorn.
That is a strange thing to say, I must take note.
It's a good thing Bernie's here.
Sana-chan was more awesome.
It's Gary-san! This is Hamilton-san.

I am Kurata Sana, a first-year student at Jinbo Middle School.
Actually, I don't know what he's talking about either.
This was Mama's idea.
Hurry!
Why is she suddenly...
See, I made a bridge.
I feel that having you as my brother
Your good intentions make me very happy.
I see, she said these great things.
I want to stand by your side and protect you from now on.
Look.
but this is a good opportunity.
while away the happy days with Bernie-chan.

Small fishbones?
No?
What it actually is...
It was really successful.
However, it's going to become busier.
I will guide him to the best of my ability.
I will try my hardest not to disappoint everyone and produce a great star.
That's really great.
Come, Naozumi. Hurry up and let everyone know what's in your heart.
This show...
I don't feel that you're my father.
No matter what happens,
Of course we can.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Stupid Sana, come visit us again.
I will strictly train you guys again.

And the lucky and kind female cop, Tomomi-chan.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
The minute people start singing, they are arrested. What a dilemma.
I'm Kurata Sana, the leader of the band who leads everyone in carefree, happy singing.
Just now we brought you a live broadcast from the streets.
It's ben a long time since I've been back!

Sing! Sing! Even when it's against the law, we still want to sing.
Please continue.
I broke through wall, I had control of the situation...
I haven't appeared in a long time and I'm instantly taken out.
The best money partner.
A bunch of idiots.
What new songs will this country inspire in me.
I should find some place warm and eat something hot.
I'm special agent Tomita Mayu. It's my second appearance here tonight.
This person, I don't know where she was just now. Yet she had the nerve to talk nonsense.
In that case, I must arrest Naozumi-kun.
Sorry, that I caused your mix-up. Please don't be mad.
Yes! It's prohibited here.
That's right! Even though it's against the law, strange laws are hard for people to obey.
Wait a minute!
This person, don't tell me that she was here this whole time?
Hello, Ayano Hanamaru Koji-san.
Just got here plus a little while ago makes it very hard to determine...
Absolutely no problem! No problem!
Good evening, everyone! We're the police.
I just used a small trick.
Thanks to Agent Tomita, we were able to plant this tracker.
That's right... by using Naozumi.
There's something strange!
Brad, even though you thought it happened this way,
Using Naozumi-kun was something that you came up with all by yourself.
Thank you very much for protecting me that time.
He confessed.
It wasn't!
You can't play a trumpet here.
...don't want to arrest you.
I also think that the song prohibition law is very strange.
I'm relieved to hear you say that.
The glove hat really suits me.
the club will continue to fight.
It's sushi.
Let's sing, Mayu-san! Let's sing, Sana-chan!
The ship has set sail, but the sound of its whistle still rings in my ears.
- Hisae-chan, what are you eating? - Sushi!
Love you, love you love you, but now.

Because of you my life became really screwed up!
Kissing between couples is normal.
No way!
11 years old, we go out.
You should tell her before she leaves.
That scene, Hiroto...
The phone somehow works and I got through to you.
It's over.
No! Not someone bad like me!
It seems that I got turned down.
Anything... even if you love someone else.
I'm sorry.
Sana, you're back!
Look up to me.
Because both of you are couples...
I don't know what's going on.
Tell me the truth!
The truth?
Past?
I have to go. Stay strong!
Bye-bye...
I finally pulled through.
Whether in Japan or in New York, we fought everything together.
I wonder when I can get back.

I never got a mark lower than 80 in any test.
Here, just remember all the points I marked.
There's dooding all over it.
Shh, it hasn't even been 30 minutes yet.
Back then I was still a little worried that Hayama-kun might still really love Sana-chan...
Well... then... Ha... ya... ma...
Fuka-chan, I'm sorry, does it hurt?
Eh? Is that true?
Never mind.
Wait up, Akito.
It was just a scratch.
Damn, you two still have time to talk about porno.
I'll remove the hair from your heart.
Maybe I need to add water... in the electric iron...
Out of the way, out of the way!
You're really slow! Out of the away!
Looking good!
Maybe you could get something even better.
Excuse me... could you take a picture of us too?
You two?
Our picture came out but Akito-kun's didn't.
Hayama-kun is so cute.
Even though it seems unfair, I'll let you have the best couple award.
What are you trying to say, snot boy?
Yeah... it's great to be young.

Don't tell me we're going to plunge on into the serious stuff!
Sensei was thinking that we could all create a monument
I know you made it for me, but my appetite seems to have gotten lost.
If you're leaving that, can I have it?
Haven't you noticed?
She... doesn't know how she should be taking Gojo-san's death.
There's no way I would die!
I was wondering if Take-chan's... if Take-chan's ghost will appear.
Front teeth go boom!
Wow, you've finally come back to "Child's Toy," huh?
You're being a pest!
W- what are you doing, you brat!?
What about it!?
This gentleman is a producer-
It's my fault! I don't know what I did, but I'm sure it's my fault!
Snow...
She might have...
...and then, we can always stay together.
Anywhere else would be okay,
who also said she wanted to go to Yatsugatake.
--Fight! Attack!
I wonder if Sana-chan is all right. What do you think, Tsuyoshi-kun?
What do you think, Hayama-
What do we do!?
Babbit just wants to appear... even if this is what I have to do...
Place the center of your body over your rear end, make a tight fist,
If you're there, answer me! Even if you're not there, answer me!
I'm staying here! I'm staying here with him, forever and ever!
No! I'm staying here with Take-chan!
You died, leaving behind so many things that you wanted to do.
--To explain, they just fell from here to here. --We were worried!
--Oh, the one who is on TV? --I'm safe now, so the search will no longer be necessary.
You two really seemed close, like father and daughter.
He was there! By my side! By my side... my... my...
Take-chan, isn't this great? I'm not the only one who remembers you, Take-chan...
I'm... home.
Welcome home, Sana.

She was so excited.
Why are you turning your back to us?
You seem to be very excited.
Was it Hayama-kun?
Sengoku-sensei...?
He was always causing trouble.
Teachers won't lie.
Fuka, Papa and Mama didn't say you can't be with him,
She sounds strange.
What happened?

Let's have a welcome party.
You're earning a lot of money to yourself.

Let's ask Hisae-chan them to come with us, they want to see Sana-chan too.
Look at this guy from the winner of best couple.
Tsuyoshi-kun, are you all right?
We haven't seen Sana-chan in a long time too.
Sana.
You're open minded.
That's no problem.

Watering is a lot of trouble.
I didn't know that.
I can't believe it, there's someone who looks like Hayama in another country.
Aya-chan, your wording is not very nice...

Let me see.
Oh, the amusement park tickets we won for the best couple award!
Only you going will be fine.

Don't worry about us.

Okay.
Finally, what is your name?
Um...
Wah! Sana-chan! You are a great person!
Friends?

Sorry for the wait.

Maybe it will be better if you lie down.

I will try my best and not lose to her.
My mind was very confused.
You really didn't do anything wrong.
Just a note. Please, no phone calls at three in the morning.
Ever since Sana-chan returned, you have been acting strange.
Akito-kun...
Oh, it's really Sana-chan.
You have just declared your feelings, and you'll play a couple in a drama.

Yesterday?
I heard that the script was finished yesterday.
After that, do you want to hang out?
It's ok. After practice, you'll be tired. Don't push yourself.
I'm getting embarrassed.
Yes...
You're quick.
It's a sticker picture machine.
OK?
Fuka, do you have two hundred yen? I'll pay you back.
Are you giving me money?

Who does she think she is?! I absolutely hate those actresses.
She thinks she's better cause she just came back from America.

I can't leave Sana-chan like that!
Think about it!
Yes, just give me an hour and I promise I'll bring Sana-chan here to you.
This week's Sana-chan.

Sorry about this.
Oh, welcome home.

This is wrong.
She may not be able to stay in Japan's entertainment circle.
Don't they do that every time? You should be used to it by now.
But Sensei! Doesn't it make you mad?
Who's going to figure out what to do?!
Let's give it a rest.
Why?
For you, for Naozumi-kun...
But I feel that I'm not wrong.
She's gotten out of bed.
What are you doing, you dork?!
You should at least warn me.
I'm not saying...
No, I'm okay.
Can I have something to drink?
Were you doing karate training?
People sent me all kinds of food. Would you like some?
Okay, I'll have some too.
You must take good care of it.
Is that so?
Is it easy for you to get into character?
How to say, I'm not too sure myself.
I feel as an actress being a little headstrong is alright.
Enough. Let's go home.
There are lines... you just can't say.
Ok.

My getting hurt wasn't his fault.
Let me deal with this, please.
Hayama, she's seen through you.

Didn't I say I have nothing to do with her?
Don't come and see me anymore.
Please, don't torment me anymore.

Mika, did you know that the reason Mom's health got ruined
And ever since then, I've done nothing but work hard, taking care of you.
And all I ever wanted was to just he happy, too!
And he was raised being told that kind of thing for real...
What are you doing, Rei-kun?
I'd like to hear about the relish you're undertaking this with.
Are you still playing dumb!?
The interview went okay, and I made my declaration of war!
Let's see... Favorite food, toast with nothing on it;
he's been disappearing all of a sudden. He's acting very strange today.
And Sana-chan, too, could you please report to makeup?
If I was in a family where I was raised, being called "devil, devil,"
The drama's happy end will be contagious,
Drama? What drama?
You haven't heard?
Now I've gotten the dum-dum father-and-daughter together.
that he has become so frantically twisted,
Don't you like being together with them?
Say, Hayama...
Do as your mother tells you!
Mama loves you, Mika. I've loved you since before you were born. That's why...
And so, for Mama's sake...
Sana-chan...
Thanks. Bye now.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
The mysterious white bat straight man, Babbit.
There is only one reason why we are gathuhed togethuh today,
--I think it was that kiss that one time
K- kiss!?
Y- you know what? Don't get too angry about this, okay?
Ow, it's in my eyes.
It's going to get all sticky. Come on, hurry.
Not even I did anything like that.
an8"Bottom of shoe"
But that has already been resolved, hasn't it?
Sana-chan, amazing!
Mm-hmm! Thanks! That's real friendship!
It's hopeless.
at this point, it won't do any good.
This is lame.
Let go of me, would you!?
It doesn't matter what it is,
--Sensei!
--Andoh-sensei!
Sensei, we love you! Sensei!
Hayama! Don't tell me you!
Not really.
 And now we've drawn Sana-chan! 
It's genuine!
He just loves his mom, that's all!
Really, I'm the one who should be embarrassed!
Oh.
That's silly, Principal.
And so, we now bring you the press conference
Yes. That is where I grew up.
But Kamura Naozumi-kun did come.
Would you let me join in with you!
-- Chaka-poko, chaka-poko, 
Hey, Sana-chan! How's the party?
1, 2, 3...
-- tonight we sing to you 
Ho, you're going to tell us about it?
--Say, does anyone know any pretty goils?
This was just delivered.
And so, the round-table apparently didn't reach any conclusions,
Cu: your heart will be carefree,
so just keep going unlike this,
a tale of "what exciting new developments will there be? With vocalist Shinohara Tomoe-chan,"
blur2.667watashi ha itsudemo RIRAKKUSU
Sana-chan, what are you saying?
But this handwriting looks very similar to yours.
I said that I hated him before... I need to apologize now.
Fax?
She wrote, "How are you, director? I heard you are working on a new movie."
Ah, thanks, Shimura-san.
What bouquet?
There's really a fake one!
I wanted to go once.
I'll support you too.
We were still serried about that other time when the media blacklisted you.
Who?
Everyone's saying it.
A lot of things that only Sana-chan knows herself, but nobody else does.
If you're the real Sana then get a grip.
Look at you now. You can't do work, you can't even do the times tables.
Time for a beating.
- Since it's not dark yet. - Alright!
If we can finish before money runs out this time, then it'll be first.
This time has been my happiest experience.
But it doesn't matter now.
I mean...
Hey, Sana-chan.
The fake.
How disgusting.
Sensei, please finish the draft quickly.
Wait a second. Hello?
The real Sana is right here!
- Are they gone? - Yes.
Let's go see that impostor.
This is hard to take in.
You're right.
Recently in movies it's very popular to say this statement.checar
Bald?
Look at the sender's name.
What's wrong?
I... I'm Kurata Sana. 9 years old.
Because of a disability I can't got to school and I'm home-scholed.
Those videos really motivated me to work harder.
This way, kids who can't go to school can watch and learn from videos at home.
After reading this letter I'm cheered up, and have gained confidence.
But right now you have no jobs.
This is...
Another weird message asking for help.
Because I wanna try crying with you
And make me the only one you love
When you're sitting pretty, with enough and to spare,
blur2.667WABISABI kikasete DERAKKUSU
- Hisae-chan, morning. - Morning!
The most important reason the video turned out well is because of Sana's strength.
Maybe she'll be absent today.
Do you have time to come to school?
Really?
I've already decided to be absent as little as possible.
Is it really possible?
I finished all the things I needed to do, even the air smells very fresh.
Listen to me. Sana-chan.
Why are you feeling so gloomy?
Seems like the wind of the South Pole gave you a sad face. This isn't like you.
Sana-chan.
You guys are standing at the entrance. Of course we can't get in.
Are you really?
Horrible.
What are you talking about? It's your job to keep the show going.
The ink doesn't stick well.
What are you talking about, Zen-chan?
And not to mention, the other party is human.
If you don't do it... how you deal with rent and food?
You can say it like that. But it's not completely like that.
It should be 70 hard work and 30 luck.
That also means that three shoemaker's together is better than one wise man.
That is really a good phrase.
That's ok, don't worry about not having a job.
Don't run, thief.
What? 'Old ladies Toy' has been canceled?
Why? I thought the rating were good.
It's all over.
- Zenjiro-sensei! - Zenjiro-san!
Isn't this great? Isn't this great? Isn't this great?
So this is it! You don't need to find it.
You really don't want to help us?
Alright, I will help at tomorrow's meeting.
She can't talk right now.
Fuka-chan said you were ready to study hard, so everybody came to help you.
- Aya-chan! - Tsuyoshi-kun!
Everywhere you guys go you are all over each other.
Wait a sec!
Because chickens only have 3 seconds of memory.
I only have 3 seconds of memory? Cluck, cluck, cluck.
I am going to teach you again so listen carefully.
We hope Sana can shine gloriously.
Quick, eh?
- I am the chief. - Indeed a big-shot.
Got it.
Looks like you don't know what will happen next, after you've grabbed it.
Math?
Hurry up!
Sana-chan!

I am feeling Ultra Relax,
I may be a little jumbled,
Yes! I use that as an excuse to call him!
I'll have him call you back when he gets home.
There will be a lot of cute girls!
Just one.
It's nothing.
Aya-chan! I'll stick with you forever!
Are you going to the Valentine Event?
Can I sit here?
To wipe away the past, I'll go happily!
Sana-chan, are you going to the Valentine Event?
What's the point of that, Hayama?
- Okay! - Are you alright, Tsuyoshi-kun?
- Aya-chan... - Tsuyoshi-kun...
Hmm? Chocolate...
All right!
Actually, Shizu and I...
Alright! We have to work hard, Sana-chan!
- Saint Valentine's day. - We should speak like this.
Wow, there's a lot of people!
Wait a minute, Takaishi!
What happened to Fuka-chan?
He looks sad.
There are too many girls here, can you find me some guys to come here?
Would you like to go to the Valentine's Event?
We're a little short on guys.
Really, really!
Here's more sushi!
Hey, Hayama! What are you doing? Where's Fuka?
This kind of girls?!

Hold on a sec!
I'm not bragging,
This is really something he shouldn't brag about.

What's going on, Rei-kun? You look so happy, humming like that.
There's a very good chance. We'll know by the end of day.
But I don't want to miss school.
I'm your business manager,
Please forgive me.
Ah well, then please return quickly.
Ok, thank you.
What's there to study?
This is a little gift from the company, please don't mention it.
Are you still waiting for them to call?
Yes, what is it?
It's busy... Why is he acting like this?
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. He really knows to take things slow now.
There'll be some people coming to interview me the day after tomorrow.
Right, so it' decided.
Hello?
Oh, yeah.
Bye bye.
What are you talking about?
What?
Look...
Oh, he's on the fourth floor.
It's all up to you, I don't care. When you have decided, just leave message on my call.
At that time... New Year's Eve...
Sana-chan, Sana-chan, again...
How am I supposed to know?
Sorry, I need to go buy some cigarettes.

It is accessible the audience has forgotten me since I didn't appear so long.
Let's have a look at the following memorable scenes:
He's coming.
The milk has formed a bad omen.
Misako, lend me some money?
It has been so long.
He's an example that will never improve.
- His eyes. - Eyes?
So I lent it to him.
Kurata, what are you doing?
The trailing continues.
Here's 100,000, I'll give you all of this if you stop hanging around Makoto-kun.
Misako...
but I'm going to be his father
Very typical of me, huh?
It'd be better if you stop being a hen.
It's not the first time I, Sana-hen, stuck my nose in other people's business.
That's right, that's right, that's right!
Will we have the Stewed Meat with Potato today?
Hohoho... I have a great idea.
To become a great person.
Hand it to us, pong!
Really, where have I...
Look! It's Zenjiro-san and Sana-chan!
Really! We're on TV!
Uh-oh, there's a banana peel on the floor.
Aren't you the one setting childish traps?
Makoto, you don't have to...
What's going on?
When he becomes serious, there must be something big going on.
But I won't be after my marriage with Miyoko-san...
That gigolo Ryosuke is this serious...
but he really isn't anything good.
Good person?!
Looks like it.
But I guess it was all wasted.
But you don't' know if that's true, right?

Hey, that's...
Alright! I have go tell Hayama.
Lift your spirits! Let's go!
No, there's nothing wrong with dad.
I'm going undercover! Ha!
I saw your sister at Harajuku today!
Who's the other guy?
Well, what kind of person is he? I'm so concerned!
Oh, good afternoon.
Then, Sana-chan, what do you think about Nishikawa-san?
Yes, I would like you to print out this file.
Beneath the sky of Paris! By the riverside today!
But, the one next to him isn't Hayama's sister!
Or is he really a playboy?
Yes, are you done with your business?
I heard you are taking karate, right?
- Sis. - Hot!
Oh, Okayama-kun, is it?
So Hayama's father was a bad...
Mm, goodbye.
And the next one today is...
There's an indecisive somebody over there!
- Aki! - Aki-chan!
We'll pull his tail right in front of her, and uncover his true identity!
I get it.
Ah, wait. Don't move.
He even sat next to her!
What the...?!
Pick it up, quick!
Forget about him soon. What the...?
Don't be so interfering!
Dad is starving...!
Akito! You're the last one! Make sure to lock the door after you leave!

He hates me.
So if Sengoku-sensei pisses you off with his little remarks, come to me.
Ok, you are actually on the Gymastics team, right?
it's not an easy task.
Ok, two members arranged now!
Yesterday night, Mama helped me make signs.
Will you...
Who was that person with the bushy eyebrows and bleeding nose?
Ishida-kun, you'll actually join the Karate club for us?
So we need two more people.
Ah, maybe that place is good!
so often that I know this place.
Ooh, how nostalgic.
Kurata, I'll leave you with the door lock.
- Why? - I don't know.
Um... Sana-chan.
Starting now, I will do the training that I usually do, so keep up with me.

- Seafood taste griddle cake? - There will be many seafoods on it.
What? You're in my class?
Are you a utayako or something?!
My grandfather laughs so hard with them!
One more push, Hayama! We'll have enough members.
Huh? Nakakaruizawa-kun?
He was such a precious member who wanted to do it from his own will...
Not curry again!
I guess I can't be helped. Father, I'm sorry.
Hey, Nichoku, the eraser's not here.
Ok, Hayama, dance!
- Because it is fun! - Yes, yes.
Alright! Without brother we're so lucky, huh!
Nice to meet you.
So we just left it all to him.
This Hayama...
Damnit, again in a bad situation.
Nakao-kun's disappearance must have Hayama involved.
For it's dangerous for Hayama-kun to make Karate club...
Excuse me.
it was too heavy for me. And the next day, my body wouldn't listen to me.
And finally I had to stay home from school.
You wanted a reason, right? I got one.
Now I could definitely get Hayama away from this school.
I can't think it was a normal training.
Principal, this is Nakao's letter to me, please read it.

For this incident the people who made the karate club are deeply involved.
Ah... my mother is diagnosed with an incurable disease, so I have to nurse...
That's right.
What the hell...
But I will never approve of a student like you.
Let's think about the missing chalkboard erasers.
Ooh yeah! Stretch!

Hayama-kun...
Idiot.
If you die then you'll become a mummy, do you want it that way, huh?!
Don't be silent, that makes me lonely.
That pisses me off.
Sengoku-sensei...
and I thought nothing matters anymore.
Hey you!
And so he always carries all the weight and gets more enclosed.
Why are you crying when you're insulting someone?
I'm not crying, idiot!
I don't understand.
In other words, we have little chance to change in our life.
Yeah, and he was with Kurata.
The two still left their bags here.

Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Listen!

Hayama Akito, a passionate loner and my good friend.
Sana, we're going shopping. Do you want anything?
The atmosphere is nice, but it's time for a scene change...
That's not it...
Hey, Yumi-chan, how are you?
What was that about?
This makes me so mad!
I accept!!
Ok, then I'm going...
But later, don't say a word, just keep quiet... ok?
What? I thought you must have changed to a Tokyo accent by now!
She's Takaishi-kun's girlfriend...
She's a very quiet girl...
About twenty minutes...
but if you're completely quiet, they'll think it's strange.
why does this feel like I've been freed?
Staying in this posture is tiring...
Don't say things like this!
And Takaishi is mad at you because the truth is he still likes me...
Yakisoba!
Others are fine.
After all you don't see each other much.
Idiot! Stop saying all that!
How did I have a boyfriend?
Matsui, you didn't say anything about it.
Forget it!
It's all in the past.
I'm going to buy it!
...even when you and him were good friends...
What are you saying?
I'm a little tired...
Matsui...
Sorry... it was my misunderstanding...
What are you saying?!
Come visit me again!
Ahhh... now I get it...
Uncle, I'm here!
Did you think we wouldn't discover you?

I told her that when she gets there she had to keep in touch no matter what...
Yeah, tomorrow the sky will be clear too.
I wonder if Fuka has gotten the postcard yet.

Matsui Fuka, the girl I met in the bathroom!
You did this to my brother!
Sana-chan, are you ok?
How do you say 'Fan' in Japanese?
Ok, that's enough for today.
Is the director still there?
Did he say anything?
Um... no not really.
Asako and Rei-kun are acting a bit strange.
Rei-kun, Asako has a love scene tomorrow.
Do you mind?
Right!
Adult's love... I don't get it.
Do you get nervous in these love scenes?
Yeah, but I think Kawai-san is more nervous than I am.
He can tell that your measurement is 70 on the bottom with an 85C bra size.
Did Rei-kun say anything today?
It's a lot of pain, but you and Rei-kun get it together.
Girls who don't wear bras are normal!
That's right, do you want to go shopping tomorrow?
There's enough break time to go to buy one.
Tomorrow both of us have filming in the afternoon.
Don't worry, don't worry, I'll be right back.
I'll show it to you when I get back! Looking forward to it?
Hi, lady! Help me find a very supportive bra.
Sana-chan, do you want me to drive a little bit slower?
Parte B
Why?
If you ever get close to him, we're gonna make your life even worse.
We were really happy to find out that he was going to be here.
New Half?
We have to go now.
You don't love her, right?
Hmm, Rei-kun!
Don't waste food! If you're good child don't imitate this!
When Asako wants to do her job well I don't want to bother her.
Of course I want to do the job well.
Why did I just see Hayama's face?
Ah, it's nothing!
It's true love, must...
Blanks!
I feel sorry for him.
If you were a little more persistent, this wouldn't have happened.
Yeah, just a little.

It's ok, it's ok, I was also taken by surprise.
What does that mean?!
That's all then, it's 2 AM.
If you want to sleep then you should go to bed.
What are you talking about? I won't quit!
But this is serious.
Mako doesn't run or jump, right? She just walks around slowly!
No way, I can't let you do this.
Yeah, I heard an old lady said it.
She's really hurt.
Rei-kun, am I heavy?
I'll prove it to you, I can run 100 meters carrying you!
Don't act worried in front of them because I got injured.
He's been really depressed.
I'm quitting!
Hey, I'm gonna do my best! You're gonna do your best too, right?
I can't snap out of it...
They did such a thing because those fans like you too much...
For you to be able to think this way... It's unreal.
I wanna beat them up until they have broken skulls and serious broken bones!
Sana, enjoy yourself even under adversity.
Sana-chan!
Piling up?
What's abiriba?
There are no people here in the wilderness of the mountains,
This's the boy and girl who are starring the movie Sana-chan and Naozumi-kun!
Have you ever seen that?
They're probably doing fine.
Okay you two, let's rehearse.
What?
Sana-chan!
I told you she was simple.
Coming to work immediately isn't a good idea.
Watch me work.
Hayama.
"Acompany to fall in to sleep, Naozumi."
But... I can't believe it.
What will poor Hayama think?
It was... I don't know...
It could be I just got used to being with someone who took care of me.

There's only a quarter left to film.
Are you writing a letter?
Tomorrow you should see the doctor at the foot of the mountains.
I've practiced so hard at rehearsals
and have been going along with Naozumi-kun!
I just want to charge forward and get it over with!
You old geezer.
Geez, I don't get what that stupid director is saying.
Hayama Aki!
Naozumi-kun! Can I blow your trumpet?
Akito!
What if I can't catch up?
Ah, that was bad...
I'll ask Rei-kun to mail it tomorrow.
I hurt my leg.
Hmm... Letter?
but Maeda-san said he was going in the afternoon.
Look what I found.
What the...?
This is the director's cell phone.
I wonder who Sana-chan's going to call first.
Now I'm dating Fuka.
Great. Sana-chan is so great!
Actually, I don't know either.
The other day she talked on the phone with Hayama-kun...
On the phone with Hayama?
Sana-chan!
Woo, thank God!
Sana-chan!
Oh, I see.
Sana-chan, you don't need a reason to love someone.
I can't forgive Hayama for changing his mind.
It's not that Hayama-kun is bad, or anybody is bad.
Cuz your heart will be carefree,
Mm? Could be you're fairly dumb...

Mr. Hayama?
Oh, I'm so tired!
Geez, I have to sleep alone tonight!?
...tell me how well I've done.
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
By the way, I hear tonight, we're having chicken-and-egg over rice.
Do you mind?
Not particularly.
And then! And then! His dad picked him up!
After all, Rei-kun, last night, you went to bed ahead of me!
I had a headache...
No fever! No fever! No fever, I say! You've got to fight to get over that cold!
Mama, why did you have me?
Even better when your whole family uses it!
No! Mother, don't die!
For whiter teeth--
Oh, no! We're late! We're late! We're late!
Ah, Asako-san!
She sure is nice! There's an air about her.
Then you must want to meet Tamorin!
But you can't.
Rei-kun... I love you.
Bad news! Bad news! Rei-kun is...! Rei-kun is...! Rei-kun is...!
My stomach...!
--His stomach is hurting him! --you write the character for "person" three times...
Could you go to your interview today by yourself?
Don't tell me Rei-kun... is suffering from some incurable illness!
How can you talk to your mother like that!?
B- but Rei-kun, your illness...
Sana-chan, you say some fairly grown-up things for a child, don't you?
Let's see... From what my mom says,
Ah, you mean Rei-kun?
and had had a terrible string of misfortunes.
Come to think of it, Rei-kun didn't seem to want to come to today's interview.
That's silly.
Rei, where did you go?
Huh? Where is your manager?
It couldn't be...!
I didn't see you once the whole time we were shooting, after all.
Take off those sunglasses!

Next question... is...
But this time she really lost her spirit.
I don't want to see an expressionless Sana in front of the movie camera either.
Yes...
However...
She will definitely recover after one more day of rest.
Oh yeah! Cake attack!
Sana-chan! Here's some delicious cakes, have some and work hard, ok?
How about takoyaki?
Wait a minute, Rei-kun!
Least expecting... Who could that be?
Sorry, Rei-kun. I made you worry about me.
H-How very unexpected...
Thank you for taking care of her.
Who would have expected...
Do you realize that they're energizing supplements? I hope you like them.
Hmm... I've heard about it...
Mama... what are you doing to your precious daughter?
Come to think of it, I don't.
It's been a long time I don't wake up feeling good!
Mama!
Good morning, Naozumi-kun!
That scared me!
This is Onda. I'm here to get the manuscript!
This many?! Sensei!
- Please give it to me. - Onda-san...
Hey! You're interfering with our shoot. Get away, quick! So how can I go on?
Preparing for tomorrow's act.
Don't worry.
There will be plenty of fire trucks, and there's no fire in my scene.
Sensei seems to have a shameful heart ache.

Thank you, Aya-chan!
Why hasn't she come out yet?
Just stop this, director!
Prop manager! How long can the burning-house prop stand?
Two minutes would be fine.
There's no problem, we've trained with dummies for this...
- Is this really ok? - We've finished escape preparations!
If we stop now, Sana-chan will regret it!
Sana, what are you doing? Hurry up and come out!
- Wait! - Why?
Sana-chan!
Hurry up, doctor!
Naozumi, please be okay!
Did you let start hurting? Is it alright?
Back in Tokyo we've still got some scenes to shoot on the set.
Anyway the location shoot is finished.
It was my fault. If I didn't dance the mambo my leg wouldn't have ached up.
Hi! I heard you came to apologize.

- Is that so? - Sensei, you didn't close the door.
No problem...
There's two kinds of fruit. Let's see...
Visiting hours are over. Go home.
All are here 'cause you didn't finish your homework!
If she came back, she would call us, right?

If he were Brad, "Brad, do you like sushi?"
Listen carefully.
What the hell are you doing?!
The actresses and the models at the party are at least teenagers.
Everyone's exercising.
Because Broadway is a very crowded place, you should go back early.
Let's go, Sana-chan.
Goodnight.
Goodnight!
Because in my family we have a servant and her name is Shimura-san.
She's as sweet as you.
Did you say 20 Kg?
This barbell is 50 Kg.
But I really only intended to add 10 Kg each time.
What's that?
In America, the unit of measurement more frequently used is the pound not the kilogram.
Even I don't know when the weights were added.
It was a hard chance for us to get into New York.
Here in America you don't know what can happen.
Maybe there will be a really mean old man.

My family of four and I are going to stay the night.
Put on an Egyptian front and become a sphinx,
and your bitter face and bitter feelings both teeter-hatter,
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
Bright! Clear! Alert-headed, peep-peep!
I'm Kurata Sana, age 11. I'm a sixth grader,
Mama. An Aoki Laureate novelist
And yet, this mysterious actress, Kurumi Asako-san, appears before him!
Komawari somersault!!
--What are you doing, Asako-chan? --on those dates,
Come on, while everyone is struck silent!
Asako-san...
The most important thing, he said...
Huh? About Rei-kun?
Sure he would!
"Still..."
if I don't have any respect for them.
Do you mean that seriously?
Somehow, it doesn't look like I'll be able to brush this off, huh?
Hold on a minute, you don't understand what I--
If you didn't hear me, that's fine.
I'm late!
all you can see are teeth, and you'd say...
Good teeth are the lifeblood of a perform-uh!
and cannot behave yourself, even in front of the person you like"?
 What should I do now? 
 Actresses whose faces are their lives should smile! 
 When you lose heart, smile, and you'll recover. 
This week's Sana-chan
I've been there a bunch of times myself.
What's more, it's City Hall!
It's okay, tell us, you stinker! Come on, come on...
Sana-chan, that's drastic.
Amazing, Sana-chan!
He really does look uncomfortable. I feel a little sorry for him.
I realize how much I've been worrying over so many little things up to now.
I mean, look! People are small to begin with,
I do feel a little bit relieved.
You know what? If you drink some juice, you might feel--
That's what you say about times like these.
When my friends invite me by, suddenly,
he's there,
...for two.
and for an American feeling, Texas!
and yet you always shilly-shally,
a humble, simple, sort of Deluxe.
Keep your eyes on me, okay?!

I'm Kurata Sana, I'm an actress in 1st year of middle school.
What is this supposed to mean?
Yes.
Today's lesson is already over.
But...
Brad!
Thank you very much.
I didn't ask her name, but she was a beautiful lady.
We'll meet again, won't we?
Ah, Naozumi-kun's back.
Ho, it's Rei-kun! What's the matter?
Tchapin and Katchan chabin fu fu bushuuu...
People say it's safe to ride taxis...
Black Babbit, you're mean!
Yes!
You're really happy, Rei, living with such cute children.
Yes, what shall we do?
Bring it to my room.
If you have something to say, say it!
Thanks for the food!
It's incredibly delicious, Naozumi-kun! Try a bit of it, and you'll see.
I'm sorry. I'll go rest now.
I'm sorry. I don't understand enough of the situation to explain it to you...
I'll put them here, ok?
Thank you, but...
Let's dance!
Get out!
That's right.
It's nice that Naozumi-kun came.

Here you are, some milk. Calm yourself.
I am making some delicious turkey, so hang on a little.
Sicil! It's Mama! I know you are in there! Come down right now!
Me?
Excuse me, I didn't say anything like that.
Excuse me...
Now that everything is sorted out, let's have a welcome party!
Ah, pickles! Pickles here are different from the Japanese ones, aren't they?
Because they're more spicy.
Ah, Naozumi-kun left for a moment.
Hurry up, get out quickly! It would be disastrous if he saw us together here!
Yuko!
But here in New York now that I've met you, I'm not so confident anymore.
But still, I think I want to live alone.
Alone, just like before. That's what I've decided.
I'm alright. Please don't worry about me.
Ah, Sana-chan.
Somehow I feel relieved. Thank you for listening to me, Sana-chan.
One, Two, Three!
How long do you plan on staying out here?
Thank you for waiting!
What's with the scary face?
I told you I'm not going back! Not for Papa, Mama, or anyone else.
What do you want with us this time?
Give Sicil back and go home to Japan right now!
What do you mean, Brad? How come she'll get hurt if she's with us?
Sicil is your little sister!
Hold on a sec... that means... If Sicil is your sister...
Then Gary-san is your fa... fa... eee... I don't get it... I'm not good in math.

My very best friend in New York, Naozumi-kun.
I... just...
Enough of this nonsense! Come help me find him!
Naozumi!
I am Gary Hamilton.
I want to go back, go back to Kamura school in Japan.
Let's change this ugly face you have on.
I'm going to look for him.
I'll go too.
Was it that person?
Thank you, Rei-kun.
This woman loves to talk!
Is he my father?
Thank you very much for taking care of Naozumi-kun.
I'm saying you're innocent, like a little child.
Please do.
One is nearly late, the other has a cold and needs to rest.
Oh yes, Yuko-san is the woman who saved Naozumi-kun.
Because he's always trying to avoid me.
I come here and he leaves again.
They... All they're interested in is other people's children.
So don't mention it!
Don't look!
Damn it!
I don't want any. I don't want your pity.
I haven't ordered any pizza.

Brad, who looks a lot like a Japanese friend.
What?
I like the current me. I think it's enough.
...so I tried to act with that kind of feeling.
Is that so?
This musical need the two of you. It will become a big topic of conversation.
I will always be your friend.
Michelle, wait!
Michelle, don't be mad.
What exactly are you planning?
Mister, why did you approach Naozumi-kun last time?
Isn't the person who hasn't noticed you?
Whatever you say now won't change anything.
Woman stupid. Woman stupid.
Babbit's entire family, no problems!
I tried asking Gary Hamilton...
Are you Naozumi's girlfriend?
Can you please tell Naozumi the truth?
Don't drive a car in the park!
Can it be he is a born trickster?
I hope you can participate at the rehearsals.
I am going to have a party right now, please ask everyone to come.
Miss...?
What?
I am Rei-kun, I am very free. He's actually a very good manager,
but has nothing to do in New York.
Yuko's scheme worked.
But... I promised I wouldn't tell.
Like this.
Thank you for ordering!
I support you, mother.

It's disgusting.
Yuko-san...
I'll say it.
...your friend said she was lonely and left.
I want to always be with Mother.
...I actually want to reconsider it.
Go back! I don't like disobedient children.
No. Why?
Sicil! Sicil! Where did you go?!
Naozumi-kun, she's gone! Sicil's gone!
Just as you thought? Naozumi-kun, did something happen?
Yes. I'm going home right away.
Rei-kun, phone!
Why?
If something happens to Sicil, I... I...
Our only choice is to split up to look for her!
What?
Why don't you dance with that cute girl?
Six. Six. Can't stop.
Sana-chan?
That girl might be Sicil.
Don't give up! You have to keep on living!
Sicil, I'm going to rescue you.
Don't tell me Sicil...
Even if you do this, it won't bring Sicil back...
There seems to be activity at the protection center.
Nobody needs me.
I don't need to know and I don't want to know.
Naozumi is the same. Everyone's a liar.
What are you doing? Hurry up and get a powerboat over here.

- It's not important anymore. - Not important.
Naozumi said he was going home...
Bye-bye, Manhattan!
I'm kidding, don't worry...
I'm sorry, Naozumi.

It's me.
Ah, Maeda-san. You're here early.

How sharp!
Hold on tight!
Ah, Gary! You're busy preparing now...
When you see it, you'll definitely want to see it again!

Anyway, we want to make it big on Broadway.
They're both strong, Sana-chan and Naozumi-kun.
Ahh, that's true.
Alright...
What are you talking about, Unagi-san?
You mean Usagi...
Especially since I'm the one that all this is happening to now...
Hey Miss, are you from Japan?
Be quiet!
Michelle-san...
I thought you two were just noisy and mischievous children...
Although I don't know what he wants, it's still better to hear him out I guess.
Long time ago, hmm... already 14 years I guess...
After a while, she pursued me all the way to New York.
She couldn't succeed despite that passion which drove her to abandon me.
Yelling out then breaking the ceramic tiles
I'll see you next in the Japan chapters!
I'll put it this way, Gary-san. Haven't you realized that Sicil might be scared?
Hey Mr. Gary! You've always decided on matters by yourself... right?
Action!
- This is Do. - Do Re Mi's Do?
Say it already!
Ahh... ants...
No, I have indeed become a child who nobody wants.
What are you talking about?
- What did you say? - Calm down.
What? You too! You can't even memorize your lines properly.
I quit too.
There are other replacements which I can easily find. There are a lot!

Don't use up all your energy.
I won't allow you to rehearse anymore.
Now go home and go to bed.
I have no talent, no nothing. It doesn't matter what happens to me!
Well, you only have me, right?
How can you say this to your own mother?
Ah, that felt good.
Sana-chan, let's go.
You are my son after all.
Hey, that's a bit too much.
Naozumi-kun, are you still awake?
Maybe you wouldn't understand this.
You really have no talent.
That's definately not true!
Good morning, Sana-chan.
I must make it a success.
Yeah, I did say that.
Hurry up and get ready!
Just now.
Sensei, stop!
What about you, how are you doing?
Why don't you go back to the hospital?
Is that okay?
What's going on?
Oh no, I'm very afraid.
In the end you'll fail too.
We're together all along.
Why haven't you said anything since then?
Why don't we help them?

What?
That is a strange thing to say, I must take note.
We couldn't tell at all, that was a great performance.

Hi. Maeda here.
My ability to be all-knowing seems to have no effect in New York.
Sensei has been put to sleep.
Wow. A lot of people saw the show.
- Success. - How was that?
You guys are from Japan, right?
Sicil.
Brad, aren't you being overprotective of her?
If you don't mix it, then it doesn't taste good.
I thought that it would be great if we were always together.
I'm going ahead to Make-up.
Look.
It could be due to the uproar caused by Gary-san's interview
You were pretty good.
American quality brand...
Ok! Ok! Ok! Of course it's ok.
This is a small fishbone.
The entire New York City is looking forward to the achievements of Gary Hamilton's son.
However, it's going to become busier.
This chandelier falls down really easily so you have to be careful.
I swear on my status as Broadway producer, Gary Hamilton.
That's really great.
Come on, Naozumi.
I'm sorry, Sicil.
You're really returning to Japan?
Of course we can.
It's ok, Sicil.
Jeez, Rei-kun. Do you miss Asako-san that much?

We'll try our best.
Where's the logic? I really don't understand.
Arrest him! You're not allowed to sing!
Ha, ha, ha. Caught in the act.
Everyone singing loudly at Kurata Sana's club.
- They all escaped. - What?! Those idiots.
This time I'm really out permanently.
Brad, why are you sitting here?
I've just arrived here.
This time, I've come prepared.
and she was in uniform, why wasn't she discovered?!
However, I'm now considered to be a farting woman by Naozumi-kun.
What?! She can't have gone far. After her!
That's right! Even though it's against the law, strange laws are hard for people to obey.
If Mayu-san discovers the truth, you're all dead.
I've swept away the dust in the corners.
You and I were fated to meet.
Just got here plus a little while ago makes it very hard to determine...
Yes! I understand.
We're here to arrest anyone who dares break the song prohibition law.
Ah, we're screwed!
Sing! Sing! Sing your hearts out!
That's right... by using Naozumi.
Thank you very much for protecting me that time.
Okay?
...don't want to arrest you.
We'll work hard!
We pinky-swore
I don't know why, but the tears won't stop flowing.
What's with you? Don't get all worked up over something like this.
--Idiot...!? --I hear that Hayama-san's first kiss came when he was in kindergarten.
--What do you mean by that!? --Keep it together, Tsuyoshi!

Really?
Sensei, your manuscript, please!
-- Pretend like it didn't happen.  --Onda, let go! --I can't do that, Sensei!
 I ask you with all my heart. 
 God, Buddha, Buddha! 
You pressed it, all right!
I'm a freshly hard-boiled Sana-chan!
What are you making, Sana-chan?
Heh, so, you've arrived. I call this... I call this...
Oh, that is a drawback.
And who the Deutsch is the one who kissed this idiot?
You're Tsuyoshi-kun, right?
Sana-chan was acting a little weird.
It was terrible! Terrible! Right? Right?
Did you ever think about how she would feel?
Hmm? What's on your mind?
If a leopard bit you, you'd he dead.
You keep out of it!!
In that case, let's see your face!
A reason, huh?
--some new material, aren'tcha? --been over to my house,
I'm sorry, Rei-kun.
Eep! She found out!
What I do know is that he is a kissing fiend!
Or has your perversity powered up to the next level today!?
Yes, yes, after you dumped me, I flunked out of college.
and then stabilize my position as an actress to a certain degree.
That's what I told you.
I wasn't able to!
You just don't say that without even trying!
I became one!

You should tell her before she leaves.
I'll tell you when you get back.

But I'm too occupied with myself.
Because you're crying, Sana-chan.
So don't cry, don't cry.

I've always loved you! But...
Well, I want to apologize for last time... I said strange things.

But I can't say it to her when she's like this!
Who does she think she is?! I absolutely hate those actresses.
I know very well that you like Sana-chan.
When I first met you, I thought, 'lt's this child... '
That's right, I saw the brilliance emanating from you.
Wait, I know!
How to do, Rei-kun?
Ah, Akito-kun!
I'm glad that I can take ten days off.
And I can enter the karate advancement test.
Bye.
Why?
This week's shocking news is about Kurata Sana-chan.
Yeah?
Or because you're my boyfriend?
Love me deeper, hold me, be reborn
and yet you always shilly-shally,

My buddy whom I met in the bathroom Fuka.

I'll come again.
That doesn't make any sense.
Of course we'd ask her to step down.
...and cannot be replaced.
Has Sana-chan's willfulness gone too far?
Don't they do that every time? You should be used to it by now.
That kind of phone call again?
But I feel that I'm not wrong.
But you can't see so I should take care of you.
Well, I guess I should go then, I'm sorry!
Did you hurt yourself?
Oh, you said you were going to have a test soon.
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I don't feel like explaining.
We're on your side.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
An intabyuu is an interview.
So you grew quite a lot in Broadway?
I feel as an actress being a little headstrong is alright.
So you do look down on adults?
Not at all!
and tell everyone there's nothing wrong with being arrogant.
That's enough. Didn't we agree not to talk about this?
You don't know anything. What basis do you have to say that?
If you don't know what Kouban is, go check the dictionary.
I can't believe it.
What are you saying, Fuka?
He's not a bad person.
No!
Fuka.
I won't see him again.
He saw everything.
Here I come.
Please, don't torment me anymore.
Like idiots.
Hmm, these two...
Anyway that's how it is.
Huh? What's up?

Naozumi-kun who was having a delicious life in New York.
She hasn't come out of her bedroom since this morning.
Sorry, sorry, I was looking at it first.
Then I'll watch TV.
So I don't have any work at all?
It's not a break!
Yeah. Before playing? I wonder what it is.
You're a junior high school student! Go to school!
Harmonica, Ocarina? Or is it Ukulele??!
Oh, I forgot how to wear it.
If she'll get hurt, I think it's better for her not to go to school.
I see.
Hey, Sana-chan, is it true that you spat in America?
Today's society's structure is very complicated.
This is how the society works...
Excuse me for today's song!
I don't care what you do at work, but this is a school!
Photosynthesis occurs in the plant's chlorophyll.
Yes?
Nowadays since I'm unable to see, my sense of smell has gotten better.
It's today's notes.
Hey everyone, I have something to tell you.
Since it's windy, try not to catch a cold.
Yeah, he's a little distorted and that part hasn't changed even now.
Sana-chan, you're off topic!
She's alright.
So, let's have sushi tonight to celebrate Matsui-san's recovery.
Did something happen to him?
It's not really a thing to tell you.
The truth is Hayama-kun tried to save Fuka from gangsters of another school
So... that was just an accident?
But if Hayama-kun didn't take Fuka to the arcade
Hayama-kun already received a 10 day suspension!
This is not the time to do this!
Are you going home already?
Excuse me.
Please don't be nice to me anymore...
The one person you have to be nice to is not me...
Sana-chan! A guest for you!
Naozumi-kun, where did you hear that?
Yeah, I like Hayama,
Right now I like Naozumi-kun...
I didn't mean to do that.

He's now my important partner, Naozumi-kun, but...
Hayama Akito, my best friend I think...
Fuka-chan was in the hospital.
Unbelievable.
I know.
Aren't you gonna walk home with him, Fuka?
A 'joudan' and a 'joke' are the same thing.
No! Why don't you get it?!
I don't get this at all.
What?
Is it because you're going with Naozumi-kun to the Kamura school?
I heard it's really popular in catalog shopping.
You're too simple, Sana!
but will never see you again.
I don't know why Naozumi-kun said that kind of thing so suddenly.
He doesn't deserve you. So much that my belly-button is falling.
Be quiet! You're denseness deserves 100 whacks.
And she will cry with sensation.
- Enough already! - No, 50 more!
Me and Naozumi-kun were a fresh couple.
but broke up...?
But then I was dumped!
- Good morning! - Good morning!
I agree!
since it's my birthday that day.
By the way, Akito,
Ah, this kind of trash could just...
Christmas Eve Day!
But if there is such a thing, then I definitely wanna do it.
Don't let go of the wheel!
If you watch, you'll understand.
How romantic...
Kamura Naozumi.
Last year everyone was here.
Hayama was here.
Yeah.
You're gonna give it to me, right?
I'm not gonna regret it again. I have to tell her my feelings clearly.
- I lov... - I lov...
We should join in too.
It's your turn, Mama.
If you walk off the road you have to go along
And make me the only one you love

What's dad doing?
A present!
A mad scientist is...
I'm back. Today was such a bad day.
This is not good. You should have installed 'motherly oven'.
It's name is Mecha Hayama Mama.
The robot is destroying cars and houses.
Although it's not very fun there, if it got destroyed there's no second one.
- Ahh! It's coming! - It's scary!
Angel attack...
Oh! Angel finally appeared.
Magical spin.
The robot is pretty strong.
It's no good. I can't protect the Tokyo tower this way.
Listen, robot.
This is all dad's fault, keeping him hostage is acceptable.
The angel is useless.
That's useless too.
Looking at Naozumi-kun's idiotic face is pretty painful, isn't it?
Next, it's Rei-kun singing fall down!
- Akito-kun! - Akito, it's dangerous!
Are those tears?
Scientist, maybe Hayama-kun's love moved her.
Tokyo's tower's peace has been beautifully protected,
Must be.
Here, here, I turned into a carpet.
What a strange world!
Well, Sensei always misses deadlines, so this is payback time for her too.
Oh, somebody's here.
You stink too.
But why is this happening? We're clueless.
Where does the prince live, Fuka-chan?
It's pretty easy to take the train to get there.
Anybody here?
It's because you never cleaned up your own mess,
But it isn't my fault.
He's crying now.
I thought if everybody else looked like me, they would want to be my friends.
Oh, yeah, I won't believe you!
- Read fast. - You have to read sentence by sentence.
Wait.
The first skunk and toilet seat love scene.
What did you say?
But if you wait, after New Year's everything will be back to normal.
You all should've finished reading it.
Sensei had sushi already, it's good enough.

Isn't that right, Rei-kun?

Thank you.
Why don't you take your Burutcha out of your pocket?
Let me have one too, okay, okay, okay?
An egg!
Sana-chan, is that...?
Dimwitted dimwit-man!?
Sana...
Yes, you should just dream along. That's what children should do.
It happened all right, Aono-chan! That was your egg!
This is no time to be loafing around!
What sloppy handwriting!
You're not running away from me any longer!
You probably take it to be love, but that is by no means the case with Sagami-kun.
W- what are you saying? Rei-kun is my boyfriend, and my... my...
Pimp?
And about that allowance that you give him--
No... No...!
Rei-kun is my boyfriend and my pimp.
206.
...but there can only be one girl with legs that fast.
You can't go home? If you can't go home, what will you do?
Even so...
"Daughter-- The streets are dangerous at night.
I said thanks!
What?
Why did you kiss me?
I don't hate you, that's why.
What does that mean!? Do you kiss everyone you don't hate!?
Ha! You don't have to tell me! I'm going home!
Welcome back.
Shimura-san knocked herself out making Thai-style eggplant-and-shrimp curry.
Mm-hmm.

I gave a chick to Aono-chan, myself.

Sana-chan...
H- huh...?
I'm all right, so why...
...but I do think that Rei-kun was my first love.
That's okay, right?
In dire straits,
...panic!!
And our usual classroom...
I am feeling Ultra Relax,
So this was Mama's real wish...
That's dangerous!
No way.
Sana-chan, hurry up and make a wish.
 it would be really embarrassing.
Didn't you see the interview on TV?
All you think about is Sana-chan, Sana-chan!
But I want to be an actress for the rest of my life.
I still want to be Kurumi Asako the actress.
Rei! Don't be silly!
It seems that you have gone through a lot of troubles because of Akito.
Hayama-kun has really grown a lot.
This is direct mail for bargain sales.
Ka-kong and a Saluki dog...
Excuse me, anyone home?
Did you send this record mail?
Sorry we established it all on our own.
I cannot believe that Sana-chan would actually come.
To get an emergency record mail like that.
Don't joke around like that.
Where did you get this stuff from?
Wow! Amazing!
Don't lie anymore.
Sana-chan...
Back then, why did you...
I never thought that the line with 'devil'...
I panicked.
Never making that line coherent with the rest of the story.
An old friend asked me to talk to you. I worked on it a little too.
Sana-chan, you should think this over more carefully!
Wait a second... wait a second...

Sana-chan.
He's a big veteran. He filmed Ishihar Yutarou and Misora Hibari.
Oh, I see! This is easy easy!
Wow, that's good! Very clever!
that way is harder.
But this is too cruel! It's too cruel!
This is bad, taking so much time.
If you do up to that end you're going to go out of the set.
Sana-chan, is possible... you don't know how to multiply?
Well, I could manage the first half...
It's all gibberish.
Yes, Sana-chan, let's just do it.
Oh but we don't have money so...
Mizoguchi-sensei said that...
It's a little job... so why don't we take the chance and go to London?
It's different.
So, if that's gonna happen...
Yeah, that's right, Mama.
I'm gonna say this in advance, but I'm a strict teacher.
You can't do multiplication?!
Oops I tripped.
or you cannot understand at all day after day.
Yeah, probably.
What are you talking about, we're best friends.
But our personalities are really different.
The same, 28!
So I think the video will come out well if we answer that question.
I'm afraid the work will be weird with Sana-chan's opinions added in.
Anyway...
It's because it's a job worthy enough to do all this work.
I wanted to do this job.
Oh yeah, a letter came for you.
Oh, this!

Great, I'm feeling great. Thanks, Sana-chan.
I will try best. I will eat as much ramen as I can.
Bye.
When's it going to be out? I'll definitely buy it.
I'm sure it'll be better than that famous singer Miyaka-san.
When did they tell you? Where?
On the radio?
You want to run away from home by jumping out the window.
The old me?
Look at you now. You can't do work, you can't even do the times tables.
This time has been my happiest experience.
I mean when you were in Water Palace and the huge Broadway musical,
That means I'm the real one.
Of course I'm still upset. I'm the real one.
Hey, Hayama-chan.
What's wrong? Not in a good mood?
This one is a fake.
He goes to a fitness club in his college.
Yeah, he's helping me today.
No, I'll go and take a look.
- But should you go alone? - You'll go with me!
My voice isn't that lively.
Wait a second.
We only want the real Sana-chan.
Get in the car. Come on.
Impossible. I'm the real one.
Why?
But lastly, Chitose-kun, I want to say something.
Please go see it.
Hello, Mizoguchi-san.
Look at the sender's name.

After reading this letter I'm cheered up, and have gained confidence.
Yeah, supporting each other is the best way to help your fans.

Really?
Of course Sana-chan is quite outstanding don't misunderstand... Sagami-chan
I feel very relaxed.
I missed all of these.
Are you talking to us?
It really is Sana.
...but it says if not an official worker, please do not enter.
Horrible.
I didn't mean that.
Go!
I will die whether I do it or not anyway.
Sana-chan.
Zenjiro-sensei.
What are you talking about?

I've been working so hard.
My life is all over!

Dad leaves early and comes back late. So does sister.
Sana -chan, you don't have to apologize.
I need to make a new show plan, but this kind of good idea is hard to find.
Damn, this is annoying, woke me up so early the morning.
I am so glad that I could be with Tsuyoshi-kun in the morning.
I should say thanks to you.
Hayama, what are you doing?
Ok!
This time's topic is exactly youth and perseverance.
Run, run.
These are all rough drafts, they're not even creative.
What happened to Sana-chan's proposal?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, give me back my proposal.
Ouch.
The proposal is gone, where is it?
Sagami Cycle!
This proposal means life or death for me!

Is that so...
Oof, I am so hungry, please just let me go...
Hey you! You don't listen when other people talk to you? How rude!
Thank you, but I've already decided.
I won't miss school.
I regret now that I didn't focus more on school.
Of course she doesn't!
Many people watch that show, it gets very good reviews.
No, we can't believe you're leaving, Asako-chan.
We are very sorry indeed.
Rei, it's me.
You're so cold to Asako-san. You're not being very nice.
Hey, Sagami-kun...
That is, on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow, I...
Yes, I'm Sagami, I've been waiting for your call for a long time, sir!
What?
Ah, would I be in the photo?

I must set an alarm for that.
I just finished packing everything.
If you want to drink coffee, I'll make some more.
It's a little childish, but we could use it over there.

What?
Don't you want to come with me?
Ahh... ah, that was...
Rei, before we leave, I want to talk about when specifically.
I...
The contract is valid for the first year...
Well then, may I ask when her flight is leaving?
You could've done it alone!
Dammit, why is it like this?
Where is Sagami-kun going to buy cigarettes?
This the airport.
It was so hard for me to become a member of a family again.
This is more like it for an interview.
No problem, wse all know very well...

Yes, are you done with your business?
- Don't push me! - Kiss!

What attitude was that?!
Hayama, you seem to be in bad mood.
Not really!
What?
Something like that... dad's gonna be lonesome...
That took a long time, but I still decided to buy the socks.
I'll tell you. I've seen it too!

Boring, I'm going home.
It wasn't like that.
Is that a fact, Hayama-kun?
K... Kurata?
Hayama doesn't have a social life and can be naughty sometimes...
Oh well, teachers are humans, too.
Hayama, you've changed...
Whether it was a teacher or not, you would've just attacked!
...and get a crack on your back.
Really, in a sense, I'm weak.
Sana is like mail, she can go in and out of Akito's tangled mind.
Then, Sengoku-sensei can't say to you something stupid like stop karate.
But making another club means that you need a teacher-advisor...
Now if she can only do that with her regular occupation...
Will you join the Karate Club?
No! If you get hurt in karate, it will be horrible,
Well, that's right,
We're looking for Karate Club members...
Hey, you,
would you join the Karate club?
You're stuttering, bloody nose.
Manager assistant?
So we need two more people.
Yeah, because I got this.

No, it's fine.
The karate club doesn't have enough people in it?
Well... excuse us a minute, Sana.
I can't think of it that way.
You know?
Thank you very much.
Sorry, next time I'll be okay.
Well, see you.

I'm alright. If I rest one day I'll be okay.
Order something for today.
That looks delicious.
It's not Yamano Anata!
I wanna clean up. Can you move?
Absolutely, you're right.
Eh, is that so?!
- Don't glare at me like that. - Who's glaring at you?
Sana-chan, are you really gonna be a bunny girl?
Didn't Nakao-kun work hard? Maybe his example is worth to be refered to.
I wonder why. It's already late. Maybe it's an after school activity...
Most of it is stuff that won't do us any good.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
Actually Nakao-kun didn't come home last night.
Me and my husband have a small transportation company
What do you mean by that?
He's a human that must be eliminated before he gets rotten any further.
But did he say he wanted to quit?
Want to read it?

Just now, when I turned away from your kiss
ouch me, I'll pin you down with this pinch
Because I wanna try crying with you
Cutting the abdomen. This is not a surgical operation.
Shestiklassnitsa.
The lesson began.
Hayam, you're a leader here.
Sensei, Assemble!
Your school does not have...
... We do not know where to find you.
There was no...
Enough! Do you guys talking about?
Khayam gave them to us.
I can not anymore.
Whether it's a real gun...
Looks like I have got them all.
Escape want?
The therapist decided to play. No, thank you.
Oh, Peggy, that's enough to get angry. Just listen.
How rude!
Kill?
... You would not understand!
Strange.
And how do you do it to me so easy to say?
BE-uh!
Sensei, you have time!
Here!
It cost 30.000 yen.
Now you listen.
In addition, I won.
A good place.
His older sister.
Wali somewhere!
Hmm, you know that there has built this house?
.... When it gave birth.
But you've got blood.
Hold your horses!
And scattered around the school.
I do not want that.
But he has no one.
But in the end comes happy ending.
So, what is more realistic to me is I will play, the more people will believe...
... That your birth was too heavy for his mother.
It was a remarkable game.
Good evening.
Just as I am.
So when I see the face Akito...
I explode...
Hey, hey. Just wait.
Son, if you do not listen...
... Photos with removed his pants.
Because my mom loved you, Mick.
Trust your family.
Your sister said she will cook a meal.
I hear you've created problems at school.
... We'll see.
I made every effort that thou was born.
I will be the same as before.
Hayam loses.
... Kicks off the table.
But... gradually...
Yeah.
Yeah.
she always said she would never take away any opportunities from you, Kanna.
I see...
Well, thinking about it like that,
Yeah...
I'll be an eroge voice actor!
Nobody's here. It's just the two of us.
Speak up.
Vagina.
Your voice is too low.
I can't hear you!
Kanna. Let's go home together.
Sorry, I'm going to a studio with my sister...
Fine.
That's just horrible, isn't it?
Have you ever played an eroge?
It started right off with an event scene!
I'm that girl. I'm that girl.
Does it really feel that good?
I want him to do that to me, too...
Master, that's amazing!
More, I-I'm going to cum!
A text?
Listen.
Let's try it, then...
Sucking sounds.
Hey, hey! What was that?
N-Nothing! Don't worry about it!
Come on. I thought of a different way.
Once she gets into something, she loses sight of everything else.
Kanna, you're getting nervous. Let all the tension in your shoulders go away.
Vagina.
It seems like she calmed down.
Yeah, that's right.
Kanna, we're taking a break.
Now, go run for about 30 minutes.
I don't really get it, but...
Y-Yes sir...
Kanna, good job.
It was good, despite it being your first time.
By the way, in that scene, you actually came, didn't you?
It should be totally impossible.
Get rid of stuff
Please use it when you need to talk to me.
Do you have a nickname?
"I didn't do anything wrong. So I will never apologize"
Next, Ishida.
You can have entire conversations with just hand gestures.
Stop that.
And a star.
You're going too far, man.
We're in the middle of class.
Where were we, again...
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
Lemme see.
Nishimiya!
What? Move.
You're in the way.
Later, Shoya.
Actually, her mother called yesterday.
Ueno.
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?
Why would you say that?
Let's go home, Sho.
Be a good boy from tomorrow.
They were called "aliens," and they had a really hard time.
What are you doing?
What? If you got something to say, say it!
Remember me?
Here you go, Sho.
But it really made me happy.
What won't you do? Spell it out!
I won't try to kill myself!
It's a promise, okay?
Have this translated by next time.
Same.
Figures.
i1That hair looks familiar.
i1Who was he, again?
Hey!
Help me!
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
She's not here.
Why?
Ishida!
To mark the start of our friendship.
N-Nothing.
Wait, Yasho?
Look, Yasho.
Nishimiya likes younger boys?
Nagatsuka?
Take it back!
Sorry, Nagatsuka!
Probably using sign language.
Oh, okay.
Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.
Why?!
Serves you right, jerk.
Said she'd be late tonight.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
Hold the umbrella over yourself.
We only have the one, right?
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
Sowwy! Sowwy!
She's Nishimiya's little sister.
Will you go see this Sahara?
I think you're really responsible, though.
Yasho?
Crap. I'm running low on cash.
You'd feel a lot better if you had this much.
Long time no see, huh?
I've kept studying sign language.
I've been worried about you ever since.
I just need to visit the restroom.
We're giving out discount coupons!
I couldn't do the things she does.
Welco
Right. Your friend...
The poor thing.
Sorry about grade school.
I gave it to her.
Later.
H-Hey!
You're kidding me, Ishida.
See you.
Yuduru.
I lub moo!
Something happen?
The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
Well, if you're worried she's avoiding you, ask her to hang out.
Let's go buy some.
Here's your takoyaki.
Hey, Ishida?
Ishida!
What? How?
But I'm not about to tell you we should be friends now.
Are you going to apologize again?
You're not even trying to talk to me.
What's wrong, Yasho?
Mishiba, Ishida once bullied a girl.
Hey.
I called her.
Sorry about earlier.
What? Whose side are you on?
You're just gonna run and regret your cowardice again, anyway.
What's gotten into you, Ishida?
Yasho...
I shouldn't have come.
Keep your nose out of it, outsider.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
Huh?
Let me.
What happened?
I'll be fine from here.
Nishimiya?
Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.
Shall we go watch a movie?
A-Are you really, really sure?
Why is this boy here, Shoko?
Get out.
Who asked you two?
Was your mother...
It already passed!
W-W-Wait a second.
Nishimiya!
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
i1Man, I really messed up.
Suimon Municipal Hospital
You see, Shoko...
Nishimiya?
I was too negligent.
Why did Ishida have to get hurt?!
What is wrong with you two?
I destroyed everything Ishida had built up
He made me realize for the first time what a best friend was.
But we're all in the same boat, aren't we?
You went and saw everyone, huh?
You gan jange from now,
Found you.
Tuesday will be over soon.
If only I were gone...
but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.
Crap!
Are you gonna die?!
Thanks for having me.
I'll go pick up Maria.
I'm off.
Is that how they're used?
Are you okay now?
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
I beg you!
Nagatsuka...
Also, thank you.
A prayer so you'd wake up as soon as possible.
Kawai, you should hand them to him.
I actually wanted to make a thousand of these, but I couldn't.
You're making my skin crawl.
Why do you have to be like that?
They're not talking about anything serious.
Dumbass.
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
May I?

"Quit part-time job"
Thanks for your support so far.
What?
That's same as Ishida.
I am not wrong.
Sign...language...
Teacher.
It's easier for me using notebook.
Ueno.
Oh, what is this?
If you want to say something to me, say it!
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?
It's unbelievable!
He might do something to kidding her or so?
Why you tell such a lie?
Shoya.
Wait, Shoya.
Don't you make a trouble with someone?
Crap...
Huh.
Who is in charge?
Nishimiya!
Here it is.
Sho-tan,
Here, Sho-chan.
this!
and you sold everything, even including beddings.
Yah, actually,
But it comes to be..
This 1,700,000 yen you worked hard and earned!
Hey, are you listening to me!?
Don't be stupid, mom...
Really.
that I had to owe the responsibility of what I had did.
Sho---chan?
Thanks.
Me?
H...hey.
Of course I still can go on foot,
That's it!
Well.
What is the definition of "friends"?
Oops! ... Dropped.
Let me use it now!
Who was that turd-hair just now?
Hey!
Hey, boy!
Oops! Ishida-kun fell to the river!
Nishimiya.
Sorry but could you pick Maria back from the nursery?
I cannot.
I am hungry!
Ok!
Maria, isn't it too hot?
No, it's good!
I was worried as you disappeared in the night.
I had an argument with Shoko.
What!?
Of course, I have no intention to interfere you two.
I'm home.
Hey boy!
Then do you have someone you want to add to text?
Don't be joking. I'm not such a girl.
But Mashiba-kun is also..
You will be safe to have that much.
Huh? Ishida-kun?
I continued to study sign language after that.
And, hey, your chest got big, you know.
I'll check for myself!
Can I bring Ueno together, too?
Huh? Naturally impossible, you know?
Now is the time to "Mew mew club"!
Oh, unbelievable. He actually comes...
So did you.
...Sis?
I'll put some present for you here.
U--Ueno..
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?
I don't know.
Sorry, Nishimiya.
You two are going together?
You are friends with a girl who you bullied?
No.
Hahaha.
I'z mornigg.
Ponytail today? Why?
You MUST come.
Wait, wait. Sign language! Sign language!
Agree.
How about go out and see a movie from now?
Can you see this as a moon?
By the way, where is Nishimiya today?
I wonder she may be avoiding me...?
I guess that would make her mad.
Oh,
Follow me so that you don't lost!
I don't know.
She seems too familiar with sis.
Is she Shoko's friend?
I'm in the same class of the same high school with her now.
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.
You are fantastic as you can use sign language!
What are you doing?!
Hey you, Ueno,
Shi...Shimada...
You got angry?
H--hey!
Well, I...
Let's not use it.
By ratting on us to adults.
As a result, Ishida lost his friends,
I want Nishimiya
Did Nishimiya-san have a trouble with her?
Yes, she is.
What do you mean!?
Ishida-kun used to bully a girl in the past.
Don't be silly..
No, nothing special.
we can forgive him,
Mashiba-kun said so, and..
Hey, Sahara, how do you think about this?
Ishida-kun, don't talk in such way...
Ya-sho,
Sho-chan,
Nishimiya doesn't come today?
"Hi, Nishimiya, do you have a stomachache today too?"
Actually, what's wrong with you?
Why?
I worry about Yuzuru.
Don't say what my grandma would say.
Then I don't care if you follow me.
I will be unhappy as far as I am together with her.
Is it ok for me to be here?
Huh..
Oh, it is already passed!
I see.
I see.
Shoko!
I'll do everything properly from tomorrow...
Oh, a scar I made at that time...
Nishimiya-san..
"so I'll apologize by killing myself."
so I am totally at a loss until he wakes up again.
Everyone has hard experiences in the life.
Everyone has, don't you think so?
I have no courage to see him again.
I found you.
Oh.
Nishimiya.
Hey mom!
Nishimiya
And, let me say..
So many things I did.
to suit my interest.
Perhaps that's all.
Sorry, but forget all, Nishimiya!
who saved you when you fell into the river.
No, no, you will be the cutest in such short hair!
Well, I will do my best.
I will meet you at the front gate at 10:00, it that ok?
Good morning, everyone!
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!
Huh? The jumping-into guy?
Thank you, Nishimiya.
Ya-sho?
Actually I went here to raise my face to meet you all.
Hey, Ya-sho..?
Pleeeease!
I'm very sorry
As we have heard Nagatsuka-kun's calling Ishida-kun's name.
Hey, we don't talk nothing negative or serious now!.
Hummm, it tastes really good!
Really? Let's go together!
Pertama, perkenalkan dirimu.
Catat apa yang akan bapak katakan.
Pertama, "titik tumpu". Titik yang memberi kekuatan.
Mata empat sialan.
Yang benar saja?
Apa menulis dibuku saja tidak cukup?
Bagi saya menulis lebih mudah daripada bahasa isyarat.
Hei, Ishida.
Ueno.
Apa? Minggir sana.
Dia ngapain sih?
Bohong!
Seriusan tuh, Nishimiya-san?
Dalam waktu lima bulan, delapan alat bantu dengar Nishimiya hilang.
Terimakasih atas pemberitahuannya
Tunggu
Apa semua yang dikatakan gurumu benar?
Besok kamu jadi anak baik-baik, ok?
"Menghilang"
Hei, siapa yang piket hari ini ?
Nishimiya, tunggu!
Nishimiya?
Eng...
Aku ingin mengembalikan ini.
Be, begini...
Jangan menangis, Nishimiya.
Aduh, air, mana air?!
Hal itu kuanggap ritual sebelum bertemu dengan Nishimiya.
Apa sih yang kukatakan?
Shimada bilang begini saat upacara siswa baru SMP.
Dia itu tukang risak.
aku mulai menyendiri.
Kalian pelajari baik-baik sampai pertemuan berikutnya.
Mau ke halaman?
Ya jelas.
Dia bilang saat memberi makan roti ikan koi saja.
Hari Selasa.
Padahal aku duduk di belakang bangkumu.
Selamat pagi juga.
Sekian, terima kasih.
Nagatsuka. Cukup, Nagatsuka.
Nagatsuka, ayo pulang.
Aku juga mau lihat!
Lepasin!
Nishimiya, ini roti untuk ikan koi.
Apa boleh?
"Saya menyesal melompat dari Jembatan Suimon..
Sebentar saja.
Karena aku memakai shampo Shoko tanpa izin.
Sampai di sini saja.
Katakan itu juga pada Shoko.
Bagus.
Apa ada orang lain yang ingin kamu kirimi pesan?
Tapi, aku tahu sekolahnya, karena sama dengan Nao.
Sho-chan!
Ueno?
Hah? Ya enggak, lah!
-- Selamat da... -- Selamat datang!
Bagaimana, ya?
Saat SD, ada banyak hal yang terjadi.
Aku taruh di sini oleh-olehnya.
U, Ueno?
Eh? Ya, sama-sama.
Yang benar? Kamu bercanda ya, Ishida?
Sarapan sudah siap.
Kenapa?
Ya.
Aku...
Bulan tsuki?
Ya.
Hm, sama sekali enggak.
Tidak ada alasan khusus.
Kenapa?
Aku merasa dia SKSD.
Ternyata masih membuatku takut.
Eh? Aku hanya mencoba akrab.
Bukankah aku melakukan hal yang sama?
Andai saja dia tidak ada, aku dan Sahara tidak akan canggung.
Hubunganku dengan Shiamada...
Shoya ada di atas.
Video di bianglala?
Rekaman rahasia.
Begini, aku sangat membencimu.
Kalau ada yang terjadi, selalu saja minta maaf.
Aku tidak membencimu.
Ya, Ueno.
Nishimiya benar-benar tuli, ya?
Kawai, tenang dulu.
Maaf, Nagatsuka.
Ada apa?
Ternyata kamu di sini, Ishida.
Aku bawakan tasmu.
Hah? Kamu berpihak pada siapa?
Ueno.
Jangan bilang begitu padahal belum mengenalku sepenuhnya.
Seharusnya aku enggak datang.
Apa kamu mau...
Hatimu putih bersih.
Yo, Nishimiya, apa kabar?
Pulang deh.
Anggap saja cosplay.
Aku antar.
Aku masih sangat takut.
Untuk: Nishimiya Bagaimana kalau kita jalan-jalan besok ?
sebenarnya aku.
Musim panas tahun ini asyik, ya.
Nishimiya, besok mau ke mana?
Apa?
Kenapa ada dia di sini?
Shoko, apa maksudmu?
Yuzuru.
Cocok lho.
Kenapa kalian seenaknya?
Oh iya, Selasa depan ada festival kembang api, Ishida.
Ya.
Ibumu... apa beliau senang, ya?
Ada apa?
Nishimiya!
Mulai besok aku akan mendengarkan suara orang-orang.
Apa aku pernah minta maaf ya?
Hari ini pindah kamar.
Nyonya Nishimiya, maaf.
Dia mencegah Kakakku bunuh diri.
Tolong...
Kenapa Ishida sampai terluka?!
Hentikan!
Maaf.
Ingin bunuh diri karena merasa bersalah itu keliru!
Kawai, jangan keras-keras.
Kita semua sama.
agar bisa melangkah ke depan.
Apabila Ishida sudah siuman,
Duh, jangan gitu lagi dong.
Apa-apaan semua ini?
Aku ingin lebih sering berbicara denganmu.
Penumpang, sudah sampai.
Maria, sedang menyiram bunga ya?
Tante minta maaf.
Suami putri sulungku.
Yo.
Selamat pagi, teman-teman, apa kabar?
Selamat pagi.
Ayo.
Aku belum bilang, ya.
Aku menyendiri di sekolah.
Karena itu, aku lebih lega menundukkan kepala.
...jangan pergi meninggalkanku.
Uwah, menjijikan, masih ingin sok berteman, ya?
Kenapa ucapanmu kasar sekali?
Aduh, sudahlah!
Aku ingin minta tolong pada kalian?
Ayo ke sana!
Arbeit kndigen
Setzt euch.
Was? Kein Stck cool.
Das kommt alles morgen im Test dran.
Ich sag dir wenn es los geht, ok?
Ich hab wieder die Hlfte des Unterrichts verpasst.
Ok das reicht.
Mi...
Und ein Stern.
Dein Ernst? Du gehst damit echt zu weit.
Was zum? Wer hat das denn gemacht?
Tadaa.
Wo waren wir nochmal...
Achja, die Arten der Huser in denen sie lebten.
Hey, Nishimiya.
Ignoriert sie einfach.
Wow, Nishimiya ist ja komisch drauf.
Bevor ihr noch mehr rger fr euch oder euren Eltern einbringt...
Frag mich das doch nicht.
Wir gehen jetzt sofort zu Nishimiya.
Was? Wenn du was zu sagen hast, dann raus damit!
Was zur Hlle?
Wer war gestern mit sauber machen dran?
Zeichensprachekurs
Oh, hallo Shoko.
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
Ich hab's gelernt.
Bitte nicht weinen Nishimiya.
...!
Sho!
Hier hast du dein Geld zurck
Du hast ziemlich hart dafr geschuftet, huh?
Du hast sogar deine Mangas, deine Sachen und dein Bett verkauft.
Hey! Hrst du mir berhaupt zu?
i1Und dann...
i1Sie sagte, dass sie jeden Dienstag hier ist.
Ich will es holen gehen.
Hre auf.
Lass los, man.
Hilfe! Irgendjemand!
Kacke!
Lass los!
Nichts.
Ishida!
um den Start unserer Freundschaft zu feiern.
N-Nichts.
Warte... Yasho?
Uhm... Nagatsuka...
A-Aber sie sitzt doch dort.
Guck mal.
Hey, Nagatsuka...
Guck mal da.
Komm schon Nagatsuka.
Spioniert du sie aus?
"Mein Gefhl sagte mir, dass wir uns nicht treffen sollten.
"Was fr ein Zufall.
Was ist los?
Danke.
Was zum Teufel?
Nee, will ich nicht.
Sie meinte, dass sie heute spter kommt.
Oh, Yuzuru.
Ich hab mir Sorgen gemacht.
Danke.
Und so nebenbei...
Ich hab mich mit Shoko gestritten.
Denkst du, dass du jetzt eine bessere Person bist?
Das ist weit genug.
Oh, und noch was.
Bis dann.
Es tut mir Leid.
Yuduru!
Wie geht's dir?
Was bringt dich hierher?
Ich wusste das schon die ganze Zeit.
Sahara?
Kacke, ich hab zu wenig Geld.
Hey.
Ueno?
Alles klar.
Sei nicht albern.
Wie immer alleine.
Oh, Ueno. Geh runter.
Du bringst mich zum lachen.
Gudn mogun.
Du...
Was ist das denn fr ein Gesichtsausdruck.
Sie trgt einen Pferdeschwanz?
Ede ich komisch?
So ist es halt mit Mdchen.
Letztens meine Mashiba, dass er gerne mit dir befreundet sein mchte.
Oh...
Keine Ahnung.
Huh? Ich versucht doch nur freundlich zu sein.
i1Huh?
Hab ich nicht das Gleiche getan?
Ich wei es aber.
Ich habe super geheime Aufnahmen.
Et tut mia Lei...
Is was passiert?
Wirklich.
Ich hasse diese Denkweise.
Es ist mir egal.
Deine Augen werden noch schlecht, wenn du im dunkeln liest.
Bitteschn.
Ich schtze ich geh lieber nach Hause.
Nichts.
Du packst das schon Yuzuru.
Ich will das Meer sehen.
Ich will mit Menschen klarkommen.
Warum ist dieser Junge hier Shoko?
Ich habe eines deiner Fotos genommen und es an ein Fotomagazin geschickt.
Nchsten Dienstag gibt ein ein Feuerwerk
Yeah. Denkst du, dass sie glcklich war?
Wann hast du Geburtstag?
Ich hab "zusammen" gesagt!
Warum...
i1Gott, ich flehe dich an.
i1Bitte gib mir ein wenig Kraft.
i1Hab ich mich je dafr entschuldigt?
i1Nur so nebenbei Nishimiya.
Oh, du kannst jetzt zu ihm.
Du kannst mitkommen. Er mchte dich bestimmt auch sehen.
Ishida.
Bitte. Ich flehe euch an.
Hrt auf!
Bist du Shoko?
Mehr oder weniger.
Tu bis gefallen, wei ich mi nich ndern konnt!
Wenn ich blot nich da gewesn were...
Ich htte mich fr immer so wie du gefhlt,
Vergess was ich gesagt habe!
Maria, Sho ist wieder zum Leben gekommen.
Oh...
Moms!
Shoko hat das Eif fr mich gebrochen.
Bis spter.
Der Typ der im Krankenhaus lag?
Nagatsuka?
Huh? Das ist komisch.
Ishida!
Ein kleines Gebet, damit du so schnell wie mglich wieder aufwachst.
Was los?
Ich wollte eigentlich Tausend davon machen, aber es hat nicht wirklich geklappt.
N-Nah, es ist perfekt!
Und sorry.
Karya Asal : Manga "Koe no Katachi " dari Yoshitoki Oima
Oh...
"Saya tak dapat mendengar."
Ianya skop untuk peperiksaan pertengahan tahun nanti.
Dengan ketiga-tiga titik ini,
Tak cukup ke dengan buku notanya sahaja?
Bagi saya, lebih mudah kalau menggunakan buku notanya saja.
Saya dengan baik hatinya...
Terima kasih.
Apalah yang dia ni nak buat?
Biar betul ni, Nishimiya-san?
atau sebarang kekerasan ke atas Nishimiya-san, sila beritahu kami.
Cepatlah,
Lebih-lebih lagi, Ueno dan Kawai.
Tunggu dulu, Shoya!
Apa yang cikgu beritahu tu... betul ke?
Bank Mizuho Bank
Jangan nak pura-pura jadi budak baiklah!
Cakaplah sesuatu!
Apa maksud awak!
Apa benda!
Nishimiya-san sudah dipindahkan ke sekolah lain.
Hoi, kenapa buku kehadiran kelas hari ini tak dihantar.
Rakan sekelas dari sekolah rendah...
Eh?
Sarapan!
Sho-tan sudah bangun!
Mama, selamat jalan!
Hmm?
Hei, dengar tak apa mak cakap ni!?
Kamu akan berhenti dari apa, cakap dengan jelas!
Ianya merupakan cabaran yang paling berani sepanjang hidup saya.
Dia seorang...
saya dipinggirkan.
Terjemahkan ayat-ayat ini untuk pelajaran kita yang seterusnya.
Siapkan sebelum tarikh masa yang diberikan.
E-Erm... Ini.
Dia cakap dia akan ke sana setiap hari Selasa.
Ya, terima kasih.
Ini bermaksud saya tak boleh berjumpa dengannya lagi ke?
Ishida-kun!
Ini... kamu jumpa kat mana?
Eh... Ehh?
Ohya, ini. Sekurang-kurangnya tolong berikan roti ini padanya?
Sudah cukup, kan?
Budak kecil ni!
Nagatsuka-kun, maaf!
"Sejujurnya,"
Hoi!
Kenapa!?
Nishimiya!
Apa ni, bukan ke ini Ishida-kun?
"Jumpa lagi"
"Saya betul-betul minta maaf kerana terjun ke Sungai Suimon dari jambatan,
juga memuat naik gambar tersebut ke internet.. "
Shoya.
Maria, jom kita balik!
Hoi, kamu tak apa-apa ke?
Apa yang kamu buat di sini?
Oh, kamu ke yang buat.
Kamu pun patut balik jugalah.
Ini, Yuzuru-kun,
Silakan!
Hah?
Ini, payung.
Dah agak.
Ini saya bagi kamu.
Saya bergaduh dengan Shoko.
Awak cuma ada satu saja bukan?
Awak rasa seronok dapat jaga kucing liar yang terbiar?
Dan awak juga mempermainkan dia dengan kecacatan pendengarannya.
Awak ni menjijikkan.
Saya memang manusia paling teruk.
Ianya berkaitan dengan diri saya juga...
Oh yalah..
Adik perempuan dia!?
Yu-ju,
Macam mana keadaan kamu!
Itu..
Apa?
Kamu akan pergi jumpa dengan Sahara-san ke?
Er-Erm...
Kamu akan memerlukan sebanyak ini bukan.
Hai!
Betul ke saya buat ni?
Tiba-tiba menghilangkan diri dari awak ketika sekolah rendah dulu
Oh yalah, dada awak pun agak berisi juga ya.
Silakan!
Silakan!
Baiklah.
Apa yang kamu mahu capai dalam dunia ini?
Eh, kamu pun fikir macam tu.
Baliklah.
Eh, itu Nishimiya, kan?
Hah, tak juga, entahlah.
Saya minta maaf, atas apa yang berlaku di sekolah rendah dulu.
Itu saya bagi kat dia.
Ueno! Apa awak nak buat ni!?
Kenapa?
Oh, jangan-jangan, perasaan rasa bersalah?
Tak juga.
Soduh pugi. Sudah pagi
Saya terjaga. Buat terkejut je.
Yuju duh oda. Yuju como muhu mucam unok dyrinyo cendiry soja. Yuzu dah ada. Yuzu cuma mahu makan untuk dirinya sendiri saja
Ijida-gun, gak pulur sasoh-sasoh Ishida-kun, tak perlu susah-susah
Bahasa isyarat! Bahasa isyarat!
...Terima kasih.
...sh...ka... Suki  Suka
Gul-?
Tapi dia tak faham apa yang kakak cakap.
Dia kata sakit perut dan terus balik ke rumah.
Kalau awak rasa dia memang menjauhkan diri atau tak dari awak,
Betul juga.
Entahlah.
Dia kawannya Shoko ke?
Yea!!
Sahara-san, awak okey ke dengan Ueno?
Saya memilih untuk menaikinya sebelum saya memilih sama ada ianya menakutkan atau tak.
Sho-chan, kaki awak masih lagi menggeletar.
Eh? Saya cuma nak berkawan je dengan dia.
Nagatsuka-kun, rambut kamu ni memang yang asli ke?
Eh-eh..
Saya tak mahu terima budi baik awak.
Awak marah ke?
Keadaan mungkin akan bertambah lebih baik bila awak berdua dapat berjumpa lagi.
Hah?
Eh? Apa maksudnya ni?
Itu sebagai mesej supaya awak jangan nak dekat-dekat dengan kami lagi.
awak buat-buat tak faham, dan membalas balik.
Tapi saya tak mahu sekadar beritahu untuk kita jadi kawan sekarang.
Walaupun kita saling membenci, mari kita berjabat tangan.
awak menutup fikiran awak, seperti yang awak lakukan 5 tahun yang lalu.
Ueno-san, kan?
Mungkin ke,
dulunya selalu membuli seorang budak perempuan.
Apa yang berlaku?
Berbeza dengan saya,
Takut pada awak berdua.
Sahara, hentikannya.
Saya menyesal kerana datang.
semanis diri awak,
Yo!
Saya akan hantar awak. Di mana?
Suka hatilah awak nak ikut tak.
Selamat tinggal.
Ya? Nishimiya.
Bahkan raksasa sekalipun,
heart.
Hei, Nishimiya,
Esok macam mana kalau kita keluar lagi!
Sekarang Ishida perlu tolong kami
Tak apalah! Hari inikan hari jadi mak!
Nasib baiklah awak tak kena bunuh, kan, Ishida.
Sho-chan yang minta.
Saya tercakap "bersama-sama".
Ehh, bunga api belum habis lagilah?
Tapi..
Saya takkan lari lagi dari dugaan hidup saya.
Maria nak pergi tengok bunga api!
Saya minta maaf banyak-banyak.
Apa awak berdua buat?!
Soyu... mina manaf. Saya minta maaf
Ya-sho adalah "big friend" saya,
jadi sekarang saya tiada kawan lagi sehinggalah dia terjaga.
kita mesti meneruskan hidup kita walau apa jua dugaan,
Saya melarikan diri dan gagal menyelamatkan awak lagi sekali.
Erm, hentikannya!
Nishimiya
Eh, awak tak apa-apa?
Ya.
sudah sembuh
Jedab soyu gak tenah belubah, Sebab saya tak pernah berubah
Maria, Sho-chan sudah hidup kembalilah.
Saya sampai sekarang masih,
yang menyelamatkan awak masa tu adalah Shimada dan kawannya.
Awak akan nampak lebih comel dengan rambut pendek!
Ishida-kun.
Menantu saya. Dia baru balik dari Brazil.
Jangan berguraulah!
Nishimiya Shoko: Hai,
Itu ke kegunaan benda tu!
Apa?
Jadi sebab itulah, saya terbiasa dengan memandang ke lantai.
Kelas saya di sini.
Ishida-kun? Eh, itu Ishida-kun lah!
Nagatsuka-kun?
Ya-sho, kamu sedang sakit perut ke?
Yo, Nagatsuka-kun. Selamat pagi. Kamu sihat ke?
jangan pergi tinggalkan saya lagi!
Nagatsuka-kun.
Tapi saya tak bolehlah, berikan sesuatu yang gagal seperti ini...
tapi ia tak cukup...
T-Tak, mengagumkanlah!
Awak suka sangat bermain "kawan-kawan", buat saya rasa gerun je!
Mengagumkan yang dia masih lagi boleh bersekolah.
Akanku sampaikan ukiran kelopak bunga yang berguguran
Diriku dan dirimu terpantul dalam keheningan hujan ini
Aku mula bingung...
Apa yang aku mahu sampaikan padamu sekarang
I'm withdrawing everything.
Hey, Nishimiya-san, can you speak Japanese?
Well, that's enough. Next.
From this sentence.
At this rate, won't you frustrate your classmates?
Disgusting!
I'm Kita, from a special education class.
Sign... language...
The author described through this work,...
Too bad!
I... will... kindly...
erase... it... for... you...
Joumon-era was...
Class isn't over.
Ueno.
No, I'm not!
See you tomorrow, Shoya.
So please confess, before your parents are in trouble.
Hey!
I never do such things.
Yes!
Great men and women experienced hard times, and...
The same smile again.
Every time, you show that disgusting smile instead.
Say something!
Nishimiya.
I came to give this to you.
I knew it!
Your room was vacant, your phone was out of service,
But the story changed...
that I had to take responsibility for all of my actions.
Then...
Ishida-kun.
Okay.
Okay, sorry.
Huh?
What is it?
It was stolen.
Nishimiya Shoko isn't here.
Why?
Oh, there he is!
Huh, it was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.
Do you want some bread?
Good morning.
Ishida-kun, come, come!
You can tell me anything, 'cause we're real friends.
Hey, Ya-sho.
Hey, hey.
It's a ridiculous idea.
Don't come just to satisfy yourself.
Are you satisfied?
My friend wants to see Nishimiya-san!
I--it's not like that!
Tsk!
"I'm glad."
Why'd you do that?
See you.
Someone's there!
I'm hungry!
Ha, you have a kid.
Hey!
I was worried about you.
Please use it.
Take these.
They were mine, but
What's this?
Yes, you're right.
Eh?
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!
Hey.
Use this.
What? I don't need that much!
I continued studying sign language after that.
I'm sorry.
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.
She's not here today.
Wait, wait, what is it!?
Huh?
That's Nishimiya, isn't it?
Let's hang out!
Actually,
I'm sorry about elementary school.
I gave it to her.
No, not like that.
"What were you two talking about?"
A ponytail today? Why?
Ijida-gun, don'd need do go
Well, I have to go now. Bread.
Huh? A gift?
From: Natatsuka
Hey, Nagatsuka-kun,
Nishimiya gave them to me just now,
Stop it, everyone.
Hey, Kawai-san.
Nice to meet you. I'm Sahara.
but I couldn't understand her.
why not invite her out?
Mashiba-kun, go away faster!
Let's buy some together.
Angry, no.
that if you two met,
It was intentional.
With Nishimiya-san.
Movie in the ferris wheel?
Lot of things around us were broken by you.
But I don't wanna ask you to be friends.
I hade myzelf...
you're shutting your mind to talk with me, just like you did before.
What's wrong, Ya-sho?
Hey, Ishida-kun, you're here!
Mashiba-kun said so, and...
That's wrong, Nao-chan.
Nao-chan actually bullied Nishimiya-san, too.
Hey, Sahara, what about you?
Stop.
Don't decide everything by yourself.
Don't say such a thing without knowing me enough.
I regret coming here.
I thought that we were friends.
and I haven't gone to school in a while.
Yes, of course!
What do you think?
Why?
Ishida.
I will be unhappy as long as I am with her.
Is that okay?
By the way, there will be a fireworks festival next Tuesday.
June
Oh, it already passed!
Well..
Is it charged...?
Nishimiya..!?
I'll look at everyone's face.
Did I properly apologize for that?
what do you really think of me...?
Maria will go out to see fireworks!
Oba-san, Shoko...
I am very sorry.
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san.
Why in the world did Ishida have to be injured!
Hey, Nishimiya.
Everyone was worried about you.
Then,
I ran away and failed to save you again.
Yu bill jange brom now on,
Zaara-zan...
Nishimiya
Nishimiya
that you are okay.
But my selfish behavior has hurt you,
Everizing would go vell
I'm sorry!
Sorry, but forget everything, Nishimiya!
Customer! You've arrived!
Ishida-kun.
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's right.
I'm going to school!
Do your best!
Good morning.
I have difficulty even looking everyone in the eyes.
Ya-sho?
Why you are looking downward?
And,
Why's everyone here...
Kawai-san, you have something for Ishida-kun,
And I'm very happy.
Mashiba-kun, you, too.
No need. You're amazing.
I haven't changed, either.
be1Lucky you, Ishida. It's a girl.
be1First up, the fulcrum. It's the point that supports the lever.
be1Once more, from the top.
be1You call that a reading, Ueno?
be1Don't say that, Nao!
be1That four-eyes really pisses me off.
be1Let's go.
be1Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.
be1Ueno.
be1You did it with me, togetter, didn't you?
be1You're so mean, Ishida!
be1Yes, of course!
be1We're going to see the Nishimiyas. Get ready.
be1Hey, what are you doing with my desk?
be1What?
be1I'm dryig, ju no!
be1Hey...
be1Wait, she was saying the same thing back in grade school.
be1I'm very happy for all your efforts.
be1By the way, Sho...
be1You mean it?
be1but...
be1Kawai.
be1I see.
be1That hair looks familiar.
be1I'm back.
be1Take your own bike.
be1Uh...
be1Morning!
be1Ishida!
be1Say, Nagatsuka...
be1And requirements can kiss my ass.
be1She's not.
be1Uh, who are-
be1Well, that sucks.
be1What are you doing here?
be1Let me see!
be1Hmm?
be1Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.
be1Sho!
be1I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.
be1She's my sister's!
be1Where's sis?
be1Oh, Yuzuru.
be1Go ahead.
be1Seriously.
be1Knew it.
be1Well, I should've brought two.
be1You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?
be1Of course Nishimiya told you.
be1Little sister!?
be1I'm sorry too.
be1Hey, boy!
be1She's Nishimya's little sister.
be1I-I got a cellphone.
be1Sa... ha... ra?
be1So?
be1Huh...
be1I just need to visit the restroom.
be1We're giving out discount coupons!
be1Yeah, I agree.
be1I don't see her around.
be1Uh?
be1Ueno?
be1Oh, Ueno. Get off.
be1H-Hey!
be1Is it out of guilt or something?
be1Nah.
be1Nishimiya-
be1Ijida, don'd need do go.
be1Wait. Use sign language.
be1Do I dalk weerd?
be1What?
be1I lub moo!
be1Oh.
be1Why are you here?
be1Ishida.
be1Yeah!
be1Here we go, then!
be1Your legs are all wobbly, Sho.
be1Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
be1Look, Ueno.
be1Hey, Ishida!
be1No. we are not.
be1Probably.
be1I should take Nishimiya.
be1I'll talk slowly so you can understand,
be1But you never tried to understand me, either.
be1But instead of picking up on them, you fired back.
be1Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.
be1So what?
be1In the end, things are the same as five years ago.
be1Mashiba, Ishida once bullied a girl.
be1You badmouthed her yourself.
be1But he just wouldn't listen.
be1Something wrong?
be1Heya.
be1Nao...
be1I hate that line of thinking.
be1All you've ever cared about is yourself.
be1Sho.
be1Summer break starts next week.
be1Your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark.
be1Is that so?
be1You're a good girl.
be1I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
be1Hey, Yuzu-
be1Heya!
be1It's from sis. Gotta go.
be1Why?
be1Why are you apologizing?
be1Of course not!
be1Even monsters have hearts...
be1Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
be1Y-Yeah.
be1By the way, Yuzuru.
be1What? They're all weird photos.
be1That's not what I found.
be1Was your mother...
be1Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
be1What's up?
be1All right.
be1Oh, she's here.
be1W-W-Wait a second.
be1Why...
be1I'll look at people's face.
be1Sho.
be1I'm sorry.
be1And who the hell are you!?
be1Stop it.
be1Are you Shoko?
be1What are you doing?
be1You mean what happened at the bridge?
be1He made me realize for the first time what a best friend was.
be1Trying to kill yourself cause you're having a hard time is messed up!
be1I'm glad you're all right.
be1You know,
be1I...
be1Get this crap off me!
be1More or less.
be1So don't make that face...
be1Nishimiya.
be1Forget what I just said!
be1Well, I'm out.
be1That's right. My son is invincible.
be1Get a load of this, Ishida.
be1Take care,
be1I can walk just fine.
be1Ishida? It's Ishida!
be1Yasho!
be1D-Dit I get cold feet?
be1So please, Yasho...
be1I'm sorry about everything.
be1I brought them, but I can't give him those. They came out really badly.
be1so it makes me really happy.
be1Come on, you two.
be1How can he come to school?

Take your seats, class.
It's a girl.
Are you kidding me?
Let's leave.
Aren't her clothes lame as hell?
Even after the experiment, the manganese dioxide...
Really? I think it's just right.
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
What is that?
I'm not!
Before you end up causing any more trouble for your parents...
Ishida...
Stand up already!
Well, I did tell him to stop.
I would never do that!
Huh? Why is this here?
Get ready.
They were called "aliens," and they had a really hard time.
That look again?
What?
What are you saying?!
And who was on flower duty?
Hello there, Shoko.
Could we be friends?
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
Hey, Mom!
i1It was the biggest test of courage in my life.
What have I done?
Stay away from a guy named Shoya Ishida.
I see.
S-Say...
i1Oh, it's that guy.
What? What the heck?
I'm asking you because I don't have one!
This is your bike, right?
What's your name?
I sit behind you, you know.
Ishida!
Let's go hang out after school today.
And that is what friends are.
You see, Ishida...
She's not here.
So, huh...
Nagatsuka?
What are you doing here?
I dare you to say that again!
They're fighting.
Er...
Uh, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
Thanks.
What the heck?
I'll be going, then.
Where's Sis?
It's good!
What are you doing?
Just take it.
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.
What the heck?
Think you're a better person now?
This is far enough.
Tell Shoko too.
You know,
Wow, nice.
Yasho, Yasho.
So?
Kawai...?
Remember Sahara from grade school? Do you know how to contact her?
Sorry, I have no idea.
"Taiyo Girls' Academy."
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
S-Sorry.
Huh? Ishida?
Long time no see, huh?
Huh...
What's your cup size?
A-And what about you?
Don't be stupid.
Elaborate.
A lot happened in sixth grade.
Oh, you're here?
Wait, what?
We're friends.
Nothing, really.
See you.
Id monig.
Wait, wait. Before that...
It's fine, really.
Thank you.
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.
Something happen?
That she loves the moon.
Let's line up for that one first!
Beats me.
What's with her?
Sure. Go ahead.
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
i1But this feels kinda like...
Ishida!
I'm not mad.
Probably.
I think I want to ride the Ferris wheel.
You went crying to the adults.
Y-You're wrog.
I hade mysel.
Are you going to apologize again?
In the end, things are the same as five years ago.
Nishimiya really can't hear, huh?
Yeah.
Huh? What do you mean?
Sorry about earlier.
Unlike me, you went out of your way to bully Nishimiya.
Nao...
What do you think, Sahara?
Out with it, Sahara.
Ueno.
Sorry, Ishida.
Summer break starts next week.
Wanna go somewhere...
Here.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
I'm doing it for myself, so it doesn't count.
Is that so?
Do you have another stomach ache?
Really, you don't have to.
Why?
I'll be fine from here.
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
A-Are you really, really sure?
What are you doing?
Get out.
We did it, Sis.
That's not what I found.
Nah, I'll pass.
Yeah. You think she was happy?
Whoa, it's dark.
And the hospital said no visits.
They moved him to a ward room today.
Otherwise...
"I caused everyone trouble and was really hurt by it,
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
Stop it!
Are you Shoko?
I'm sowwy...
I used to think Sis would stop talking about wanting to die if she saw these.
We were so worried!
Even when Ishida does wake up, I won't know how to face him.
Hey.
But that wasn't right.
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.
I'm sorry.
Are you serious? That's crazy...
Let's do this!
This is my class.
It's Ishida!
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
How're you doing?
I'm sorry about everything.
Oh.
so it makes me really happy.
She ran away.

Elementary school grade 6 class 2
Huh?
You are too fast to start.
What a poor reading, Ueno.
Crap. That's enough. Next.
I'm Kita, from the special education class.
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?
Good job getting brownie points.
Nice, nice.
It's really nice.
Ok.
Joumon-era was...
Class is not over.
Nishimiya-san.
Hey, you went too far.
"I'm sorry."
Yesterday we had a call from Nishimiya-san's mother.
Stand up right now!
"hey, stop it" to him,
but Shoya didn't stop.
He made her cry.
Shoya.
You are angry, aren't you!?
What are you saying!
And, who is in charge of keeping the flowers?
Hi, Shoko-chan. Hello.
H...Hi.
Oh.
You worked hard,
I knew it!
I knew something was going on around you!
I'll stop trying to kill myself!
Ok, that's a promise.
Hey! Mom!
The reason I went to meet Nishimiya was also like a ceremony before it.
When just entered junior high school, Shimada said;
Then
H-hi.
"Isn't he feeling desperate always being alone?"
You should use your own bike.
but it seems as I shouldn't go.
I found a rat.
Huh?
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?
Oops! ... Crap.
Nishimiya likes younger guys.
Hey, you a turd-hair!
Really!?
Huh?
Nishimiya...
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?
I'm in school suspension term and prohibited to go out.
Hey, are you ok?
...Why don't you get angry with me?
I am relieved to hear that.
I cannot.
Well, excuse me.
Hey, you live together with her!?
You have only one, don't you?
What!?
What's this?
He is my classmate,
Hey, hey!
To whom?
Thank you for today.
Sho-chan?
From: Sahara-san
What in the world did you expect?
I was simply interested in your old friend.
Is she here?
A cat!
Huh?
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?
Are you joking, Ishida?
You two are going out?
Oh, I get it. A sense of guilt?
N--Nothing in perticular.
I'z mornigg.
Ponytail today? Why?
Huh? You're giving me this?
...What are these?
Hey Nagatsuka-kun,
Oh..
It looks great on you!
The other day,
She was trying hard to tell me something,
Moon
I had been scared to ride these when we were in elementary school.
You are so rude to my best friend Ya-sho!
Hey you, Ueno,
You got angry?
I'm going to ride the jet coaster again.
Shoya is in his room.
and I'll listen what you say.
I...I'b zorry...
but we did our best within that limitation.
How do you think?
I asked him to please to stop doing that,
That's not right.
What's not?
You're different from me,
I only told the truth!
What wrong with you, Ishida-kun?
Sorry, Ishida.
Grandma...
Today I got a very good bread.
What? This is my school uniform.
How is it?!
Actually, what's wrong with you?
I want to think it does.
Here is enough.
I'm still a bit scared.
Com'on, Nishimiya. Let's keep going.
a heart..
Can't imagine how I can fix this friendship...
Really!? Are you serious!?
Well, thank you for inviting me to your home the other day.
What day is your birthday, Nishimiya?
You're 18 years old already.
Nishimiya, frame!
Sorry, Nishimiya.
Crap...
Maria is going out to see fireworks!
and entering the room was prohibited...
Oh, that is ok now.
He changed rooms today.
Ma'am, well Shoko...
Ishida-san.
I am very sorry.
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san.
What are you doing this for!?
I'b zorry!!
What are you doing?
I heard things about you and Ya-sho in the past.
Do you mean what happened at the bridge?
Ya-sho is my "big friend",
Oh...
Strange, isn't it?
Nishimiya.
Nishimiya
Well..
So, Nishimiya.
Nishimiya.
Hey, customer! You arrived!
Huh?
dislike Nishimiya-san.
Ishida-kun.
Good morning.
So it is easier for me to look downward.
Nagatsuka---kun?
Hey, Ya-sho..?
Ishida-kun!!
We heard Nagatsuka-kun's calling Ishida-kun's name.
That's enough.
I'm sorry too, Mashiba-kun.
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.
Pff!
I have a favor to ask you all.
Darling
Take your seats, class.
I give up! I'm tapping out!
You, uh, went too early.
Here's your punishment for being a lameo.
Next, Ishida.
Take this seriously, Ishida.
Let's leave.
What?
How does this sound?
In order to talk to Shoko lots more,
Aren't her clothes lame as hell?
Even after the experiment, the manganese dioxide...
You're going too far, man.
Congrats, Nishimiya! Sahara went off somewhere. Teach us Nishimiya-ese sometime! Hurray, hurray!
I'll wipe it for you, okay?
Let's bounce.
We're in the middle of class.
I'm very sorry!
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
Show me for a sec.
Ueno.
What? Move.
Shoya's all red!
Let's go.
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Have any of you spotted any acts of bullying or harassment toward Nishimiya?
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.
Ishida...
And Shimada?
That look again?
What? If you got something to say, say it!
I don't understand that stupid look,
What's with you?
I'm dryig, ju no!
What the heck?
Get lost, Ishida. How long are you gonna stick around?
That's that.
Why I know sign language?
I finally understand what she meant.
I'm off.
Goodbye, Mommy.
Have a nice day.
I knew something was off!
Hey! You listening to me?
I won't kill myself!
Stay away from a guy named Shoya Ishida.
Have this translated by next time.
Kawai.
i1Can I really go see Nishimiya again?
What is it?
But I wouldn't want the money you earned in order to die, anyway.
What? What the heck?
Crap!
Help me!
Uh, she's right there.
Ishida!
Ishida!
Morning.
To mark the start of our friendship.
She's not here.
For the bread, not me.
Nagatsuka?
Nagatsuka!
Stop it.
Nagatsuka...
Are you peeping at them?
Ishida...

Ow!
Ew, what is this?
This guy.
Suspension Notice The following student has failed to follow the school's code of conduct in public and has thus been suspended for a week. Class 3-B - Shoya Ishida
You have a daughter?
It's good!
Great.
Wanna wear these?
I had a fight with Shoko.
You're disgusting.
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.
Okay.
Little sister?!
I'm back.
Sis?
Nagatsuka, that's not a "laddy."
Wow, nice.
What?
But Mashiba...
Kawai.
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
Let's see... We walk from here...
Wait, is that right?
We're giving out discount coupons!
All right.
Long time no see.
You hate me, don't you?
Sorry about grade school.
Yeah?
Sis...
Kinda.
Sorry!
...moo.
What?
I lub moo!
Yoohoo! Are you free now? Let's go watch a movie! From your big friend Nagatsuka
For real?!
Cut it out, guys.
Why, you ask?
The other day, Mashiba said he'd like to be friends with you.
Long time no see, Miyo!
They're such simple words, but I couldn't understand them.
Are you okay with having Ueno around?
I was a coward, you see.
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
Run away, Mashiba!
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
i1Do I have any right to have so much fun?
Die Go away, traitor
Nobody asked you.
No, we're not.
If she wasn't around, things wouldn't have gotten awkward between Sahara and me.
Do you hate me?
So how about we take it easy from now on?
You ok
Sorry, Nagatsuka.
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
Nao?
Sorry about earlier.
You're asking me?
I-I...
Stop thinking you can decide everything for others.
What's gotten into you, Ishida?
It's okay.
Are you still worried about your sister?
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
It's a uniform, obviously.
I saw you crying earlier.
Don't start talking like my grandma.
Of course not!
i1This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.
Right, Yuzuru?
We should totally go somewhere.
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.
Thanks.
What's up?
i1Did I ever actually apologize to her?
i1Are you still mad?
i1By the way, Nishimiya.
Sho.
Auntie!
And the hospital said no visits.
They moved him to a ward room today.
And who the hell are you?!
Are you her mother?!
What was I supposed to do?
Found you.
How are you doing?
You know,
Nishimiya.
Nishimiya...
Great.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
We've reached your destination, sir.
Are you gonna die?!
I'm not dead, Maria.
Isn't that Ueno?
They asked me not to tell you, but screw that.
Gosh. You've cut it too short!
Oh, no...
I'll go pick up Maria.
Oh, Sho.
Get a load of this too.
Well, I'll give it my best shot.
Take care.
What?
Shall we?
The one who was hospitalized?
I can't look at people's faces.
Gimme a bit more.
It's Ishida!
I'm so glad you're all right!
Don't worry about what happened on the bridge!
What's with the moustache?
Sorry...
Come on, you two.
Empty the account.
Hey, can you speak Japanese?
Her nickname's Sho.
Okay, note down the following sections.
Forget about winning the choir competition.
Ow, that hurts.
sai Mom wid an egasberaded loog.
Ta...
Via this book, the author...
What are you doing, Ishida?
How mean.
We're in the middle of class.
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
Well, I did tell him to stop.
Get ready.
I'm dryig...
I'm dryig, ju no!
She really pisses me off...
I didn't get the log.
U-Uh...
Wait!
Nishimiya!
Anyway, here.
I finally understand what she meant.
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
All the pages were ripped off from April...
I won't try to kill myself!
Jerk
i1I found myself all alone.
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
S-Say...
Anybody!
Hey!
Uh...
Fluffy New Bread Discount Coupon Miss Baguette
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
Good timing!
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.
What's wrong, Ishida?
I'm Nagatsuka.
For the bread, not me.
Look.
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
That's what best friends do, right?
They're fighting.
Let me see!
Nishimiya!
What the heck? Isn't that Ishida?
Is she really okay with it?
Come on, you can go for a bit.
Time to go home, Maria.
She's my sister's!
I used her shampoo without asking her.
Wait, you two live together?
Hold the umbrella over yourself.
Man...
You're disgusting.
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...
I'm sorry too.
I want some of Grandma's perilla juice.
Nagatsuka, that's not a "laddy."
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
You have one too, right?
I see. I could tell you...
Kawai.
Crap. I'm running low on cash.
Sho!
S-Sorry.
Let me check!
Okay, got it.
Take one.
Save video
All right.
Welco
I don't see her around.
Bug!
Wait, what?
Let's hang out sometime.
Why does she have it? Scary.
What are you doing, Ueno?
We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.
You're kidding me, Ishida.
I can't. This is too funny.
Nah.
Yuduru.
Ead breag
Ishida needs to see this.
Where I'm going?
See you.
What the heck are these?
Say, Nagatsuka.
Did something happen?
Oh.
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
They're such simple words, but I couldn't understand them.
Beats me.
Though I am still terrified.
Stop it!
Ishida!
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
Yeah.
Let's not.
and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
Oh, uh...
Yeah.
What are you saying, Kawai?
Hey.
I called her.
Unlike me, you went out of your way to bully Nishimiya.
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
Nao badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara!
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
Mom keeps yelling at me every day.
I got some really nice bread today.
Huh?
Isn't she coming today?
Aren't we on summer break right now?
It does, or so I'd like to think.
That scared me.
i1She said I'd end up unhappy if I was with her.
Shall we go watch a movie?
Hey...
Yuzuru.
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
Yeah.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
I went and said "together"!
That reminds me, Ishida.
Pardon me...
Nishimiya?
You can see the fireworks from here...?
i1So cold...
They moved him to a ward room today.
Uh, I'm very sorry.
I was too negligent.
Why did Ishida have to get hurt?!
so I tried to commit suicide.
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya.
He made me realize for the first time what a best friend was.
Trying to kill yourself 'cause you're having a hard time is messed up!
I see.
You went and saw everyone, huh?
You're strong.
Or everything after that, either.
Forget what I just said!
I'm not dead, Maria.
Ishida...
Oh, no...
What?
Who?
Yasho!
Yasho?
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
Sorry...
Thank you, Kawai.
What's your problem, Kawai? You wanna go?
I'm the same.
They're not talking about anything serious.
You apologized again.
Hey, Class B's stall is seriously great.
Quit job
Empty the account.
Okay, introduce yourself.
Once more, from the top.
We're screwed.
Here's your punishment for being a lameo.
I'll copy my notes for you later.
sai Mom wid an egasberaded loog.
Ta...
Hada...
Let's bounce.
Where were we, again...
Wow, Nishimiya's funny.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
Shimada, you did just as much as me!
Let's go home, Sho.
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!
and it pisses me off!
I'm dryig, ju no!
What are you saying?!
Hey, who was on day duty yesterday?
I didn't get the log.
Nishimiya?
Why I know sign language?
I learned it.
Could we be friends?
Could you be friends with me?
But it really made me happy.
By the way, Sho...
If you don't promise not to kill yourself, I'll burn this up.
I won't do it!
I won't try to kill myself!
Jerk
Morning.
Great.
i1He's famous for it. Everyone knows."
i1Who was he, again?
What? What the heck?
Crap!
Keep it down!
You're a god.
This is it!
She's not here.
Uh, she's right there.
What's your name?
Want some, Nagatsuka?
You see, Ishida...
Nishimiya likes younger boys?
Shithead.
Isn't that Yuzuru?
Nagatsuka...
Damn it, they met.
Wait, you know sign language?
"What a creep!"
Jumped in...
Ishida jumped into the river?!
Did you see this?
Hey...
Sho!
You okay?
About what?
I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.
Hey!
Here, Yuzuru.
Eat up.
Great.
Damn it...
Just take it.
We only have the one, right?
You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?
Oh.
That won't happen.
This is far enough.
Okay.
Sowwy! Sowwy!
I want some of Grandma's perilla juice.
Hey, laddy.
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
I see. I could tell you...
I think you're really responsible, though.
Thanks again for today!
Remember me?
Which high school do you go to?
By the way, your chest has gotten bigger.
What's wrong?
We're giving out discount coupons!
What? Not happening.
Don't be stupid.
I'm coming in, Sis!
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
The poor thing.
Let's hang out sometime.
Sorry about grade school.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
How have you been?
Of course not.
We're friends.
Well, have fun playing friends.
What's up?
It's fine, really.
Nishimiya?
For me?
Doesn't seem like they're candy.
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.
Why'd you change your hairstyle?
Why?
What did she say?
Hey... A bunch of us are going out soon. Wanna come with?
Beats me.
What's with her?
Oh, no!
Your legs are all wobbly, Sho.
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida.
No way! Don't think it's that easy!
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
Thank you.
Die Go away, traitor
I'm not mad.
Hey.
We don't know that.
And you and Shimada wouldn't have fallen out.
Do you hate me?
Nishimiya, ride the Ferris wheel with me.
Video of the Ferris wheel?
I had no understanding of you or your situation.
I hade mysel.
You were and still are a colossal jerk!
Yasho?
Something wrong?
I called her.
Sorry about earlier.
Wait a second.
What right do we have to criticize Ishida over it?
I was scared of you both back then.
It's okay.
See you.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
Is that so?
You're a good girl.
This bread...
So...
Er...
Nothing.
Because I'm worried about you.
I wanna see the ocean.
Shall we go watch a movie?
Hey, Nishimiya.
What are you trying to pull?
Wait, what?
I couldn't tell from her poker face.
I see...
You need to study?
Why...
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
Uh, I'm very sorry.
We caused you trouble once again.
Are you her mother?!
What are you doing?
Why?
Soww...
I'm sowwy...
I'm so sowwy!
What was I supposed to do?
It's not opening.
I see.
I'm still the same old coward.
Nishimiya.
You know,
this is kinda weird, huh?
Later,
Nishimiya,
I'm sorry.
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
I want to apologize to the others too.
Forget what I just said!
This suits you much better.
Thanks for having me.
Yes?
Oh, no...
Sure.
Shoko broke the ice for me.
I wanna live up to her expectations.
From: Shoko Nishimiya Hello Everyone was talking about going to your school's festival tomorrow. I'll be waiting by the front gates at 10. Yuzuru and Mom will come later.
Take care.
Is the water ready?
I actually meant to look you straight in the eye.
Hey, Yasho.
Nagatsuka...
Yasho.
I heard Nagatsuka screaming out your name.
It's fine. Hand them over.
I asked everyone, but...
Ishida...
You were going through so much, but I was no help.
I haven't changed at all.
Huh?
That's same as Ishida.
She is called Sho-chan, too.
With these three points,
How will we do in the upcoming chorus competition?
So today
The hell, ugly glasses.
From this sentence.
Today I wanna talk about "Shuwa" or sign language.
I - jo - ko
You're a bad guy.
Let's go.
Nishimiya-san, are you OK?
What? Go away.
Let's go home.
"I'm sorry."
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?
Well, today I have a topic I want to talk about to you all.
What?
"Hey, stop it" to him,
I see. Yes.
Thank you for calling.
Why are you so wet?
Mizuho Bank
Be a good boy from tomorrow, OK?
Great men and women experienced hard times, and...
What?
What do you mean!
What are you saying!
Nishimiya!
I came here to give this to you.
Can we be...
Let's eat.
It's a long story you know,
I knew it...
and the calendar...
Really?
"Friend"
Translate these sentences by the next lesson.
Oh...sorry, I have forgotten it.
can I meet Nishimiya again?
She said she will be there every Tuesday.
Sho---chan?
What?
I need a reason.
No, she isn't
She is, isn't she?
Good timing!
Oops! I'm Nagatsuka!
Ya... "Ya-sho"?
Give me your hand.
Hey, hey.
She is, isn't she?
Hey.
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!
Oh, no. They are fighting.
Stop it, OK?
This is enough, so let's go home.
Nagatsuka-ku...
Crap, she found and met him.
Leave me alone!
Be careful not to fall, boy.
What!? Something happened to Ishida-kun!?
Ouch!
I also uploaded that photo to the web.. "
I cannot.
Huh?
That's kind of typical
Use your umbrella.
Hey.
You are her little sis!?
I'm home.
I'm glad to see a friend of my best friend Ya-sho.
Well..
What?
Sahara-san, our classmate in elementary school?
as she belongs the same high school as Nao-chan.
Taiyo Girl's High School...
So take her with you, Ishida.
Sho-chan?
Sorry.
Hello!
I continued to study sign language after that.
I have been thinking of Sho-chan for long time.
I see.
Discount coupon!
And thank you for bringing us together!
I cannot behave like her...
Can I bring Ueno together, too?
Yes, you can.
-san?
I should have talked to you earlier.
I'm sorry when we were in elementary school.
Throwing it away to play, like we did in the past.
Bregbazt, lez eed now.
What a weird face!
Huh?
Iz mai voize stranze?
Oh...

Moon?
Why you have changed your hairstyle?
I don't have any special reason to do it.
Hey! Stop doing that over my head!
Huh, what did sis tried to tell?
I guess that would make her mad.
Hey, why is that girl leading us?
Hmmmm...
I had been scared to ride this when I was in the elementary school.
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.
Huh? I simply want to be friends with him.
Nagatsuka-kun is so funny!
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair natural one?
What!? Don't be silly!
Friends!
Here's takoyaki. Thank you for buying.
No. I'm not angry.
I just thought
you could be friends again.
Oops.
Hi, you are welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
and listen to what I say.
So I changed my feelings.
I want Nishimiya
By the way, I was surprised
What's the matter, Ya-sho?
He scared me so much..
Ya-sho?
Hey.
Different from me,
Nao-chan also said so many bad things to Sahara-san.
Hey, answer now, Sahara!
Don't conclude everything by yourself.
That's enough! I'm going home!
I had thought we were friends.
from next week,
Gramma worries about you, Yuzuru.
You don't join senior people groups and study sign language all the time.
You are a very good granddaughter, Yuzu.
I'm scolded everyday by mom,
Yuzu have a very beautiful mind.
I'm very proud of having very good granddaughters.
Hummm, does this sound strange?
Hey!
What?
If I say something.. Is it a kind of cosplay!?
Huh.
No thank you.
I worry about Yuzuru.
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!
Then let's go to see a movie!
What?
Is it OK for me to be here?
What?
Oh.
What are you doing?!
I'll look at everyone's face.

Please raise your heads.
How arrogant you are!
Hey, Nishimiya.

Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...

You are speaking too loud, Kawai-san...
Then,
I couldn't change myself.

I am sorry.
I interpret you
Begauze I had nod jenged,
I want to apologize to the others, too.
Hey, Maria, are you watering flowers?
You are great!

Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?
I'm sorry for what happened.
What!? Who is that guy?
Take some desserts from the refrigerator to her.
You must help me!
Yes. Shoko gave me a good reason to go back.
I will meet you at the front gate at 10:00, it that OK?

By the way, what's happened to your mustache?

Oh...Ishida-kun.
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.
So stop crying any more
If I count it, it will take whole night
we can walk without losing way
Uh...
I give up! I'm tapping out!
Gimme your notebook.
Here's your punishment for being a lameo.
Next, Ishida.
How does this sound?
ko...
Even after the experiment, the manganese dioxide...
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
Ueno.
What is that?
What? Move.
What is she doing?
Wow, Nishimiya's funny.
I'm not!
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.
Shimada, you did just as much as me!
Right?
What are you doing?
Come on, out with it!
What the heck?
I don't get it!
I didn't get the log.
Huh?
Nishimiya!
Uh...
Hey...
...!
Wake up!
Wake up, Sho!
Here you go, Sho.
But it really made me happy.
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
Here's your money back
Don't be stupid.
W-Water!
Have you submitted your math notebook yet?
i1"Oh, he's looking this way again.
i1Why does he even live, then?"
But I wouldn't want the money you earned in order to die, anyway.
I'll earn it again.
i1Oh, it's that guy.
I want to go get it.
Stop it.
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.
Dumped in a paddy field.
What's your name?
How stupid.
What's wrong?
Hey...
Time to go home, Maria.
What are you doing here?
You should go home soon too.
Here, umbrella.
Wanna wear these?
Why'd you run away from home?
And now you've learned sign language?
Yeah, that's right.
but I'm Shoko's...
Little sister?!
You're pretty responsible.
You know,
You have one too, right?
Don't worry about it, Yasho.
Let's see... We walk from here...
Sho!
Wait, is that right?
Okay, got it.
O-One hour, please.
Crap. He really came.
We're not exactly friends...
Isn't that Nishimiya?
What? I'll pass.
Ueno?
See you.
Yuduru.
I'm up. Too surprised to sleep.
What a weird face.
It's fine, really.
...moo.
These?
...moo.
I lub moo!
Say, Nagatsuka.
Cut it out, guys.
Hey, Kawai.
Why is she taking charge?
What's with her?
Ueno? Why?
Y-Yeah.
Here we go, then!
When I was in grade school, I was too scared to ride a rollercoaster.
I was a coward, you see.
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
What are you doing?
i1You know, like a group of friends!
Ishida.
Hey.
Probably.
Yeah.
I hate you.
So how about we take it easy from now on?
Let's shake hands as two people who hate each other.
I hade mysel.
Oh, uh...
I can't stand stuff like that.
What're you talking about?
It was so scary.
Really.
I brought your bag.
You've got it wrong, Nao.
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
Mean!
Ueno.
Stop thinking you can decide everything for others.
You're just gonna run and regret your cowardice again, anyway.
What's gotten into you, Ishida?
Here.
Are you still worried about your sister?
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
You're a good girl.
Shoko's hanging in there too.
Ishida.
Aren't we on summer break right now?
Seriously, what's up?
Nothing.
You don't have to.
Really, you don't have to.
Because I'm worried about you.
i1She said I'd end up unhappy if I was with her.
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
Hey.
I'm here.
Won't I get slapped again?
Looks like you avoided getting killed, Ishida.
Thanks.
June 7th?
i1By the way, Nishimiya.
I called the shop, but nobody answered.
Nishimiya?
Uh, I'm very sorry.
I'm truly sorry.
so I tried to commit suicide.
You have to learn to love even the things you hate about yourself and move forward.
Nihimiya!
But I hurt you
I'm so sowwy!
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Listen, Nishimiya.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
Atta girl.
Are you gonna die?!
She nursed you the entire time, you know.
I'm a really awful person.
Guess I don't have to.
Oh, welcome back, Sho.
Sure.
Have a nice day!
Morning.
but I don't fit in at school.
I can't look at people's faces.
This is my class.
Those things happen in life.
Also, thank you.
Nagatsuka...
This is plenty!
Thank you, Kawai.
Playing friends, are we?
They're not talking about anything serious.
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
Hey, Class B's stall is seriously great.
Nao-chan, how you say...
Pages twenty to twenty-five, and the drills on page thirty-two.
This will be on your next quiz.
Give me your notebook.
Ouch!
Thank you.
Hahaha...
At this rate, won't you frustrate your classmates?
Teacher.
Yes?
It's easier for Shoko-chan to use sign language.
Good job getting brownie points.
Agree!
Thank you.
Ueno.
Especially Ueno and Kawai.
I'm very sorry.
Your teacher gave me a call.
What were you doing? Disgusting!
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!
I'b doigg mah bezd!
What are you saying?
What!
Ishida Shoya.
Wait!
Nishimiya.
You left it behind.
I learned it.
friends?
Mama, bye-bye!
By the way, Sho-chan...
Well, actually,
Hey, wait!
Yesterday, I was thinking
a bully.
Then...
Here it is.
I just bought the limited edition...
I'm very sorry.
Take your time, okay?
Huh? What are you saying?
Should I not go see her again?
Don't be afraid. It won't come again.
Good timing!
Where... was the bike?
Do you want some bread?
Ishida-kun!
What's wrong with you, Ya-sho?
She is, isn't she?
Oh, I dropped it...
Hey.
What's happening?
Damn, she found and met him.
Tsk!
"Honestly,"
"the same thing as you."
Hey, isn't this Ishida-kun?
"See you again"
Maria, let's go home now!
Why?
Hey!
Maria, is it too hot?
Yuzuru-kun, why don't you eat?
She said that she doesn't need me.
It's my fault for only bringing one umbrella.
I don't want Nishimiya's boyfriend to get wet.
Do you think that you're a good person?
I didn't want Nishimiya to cry again.
Of course, I have no intention of interfering between you two.
Well..
Both myself and sis.
I'm here to return his umbrella.
Do you enjoy texting?
Your classmates?
Sahara-san? From elementary school?
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?
But I know her school.
Well...
Is this correct?
I'm sorry.
What's your cup size?
I'll check for myself!
Where are you going?
Here it is.
And thank you for bringing us together! It's great that you learned sign language.
Okay.
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.
Actually, she's not a friend.
Let's go home.
I'll leave the present here.
What?
Ueno, get off.
Weird.
Well, I have to go now. Bread.
What's the matter?
"But he misunderstood."
I was in a bit of a rush this morning, that's all.
Okay.
By the way, Mashiba-kun
Nishimiya was trying to tell me something,
why not invite her out?
Hey, why is that girl leading us?
She's too familiar with sis.
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.
that if you two met,
I want to go back to the time when Nishimiya-san came.
Hey!
I got a highly confidential movie.
Hidden camera.
by ratting on us to adults.
What's that?
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.
I never said bad words to Nishimiya-san!
but he never listened to what I said.
Hi!
What's wrong?
Stop it.
What's not?
I just said the truth!
You'll just run away.
That's enough! I'm going home!
Sorry, Ishida.
the summer holiday begins.
Yuzu, you're a very good granddaughter.
Mom scolds me every day.
Shoko is also trying hard.
Nishimiya.
This bread is
What? It's my school uniform.
Nothing.
It's got nothing to do with you, Ishida.
I'm a bit scared.
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy
Is that okay?
But all of the photos are a bit creepy.
Oh, it already passed!
But the fireworks aren't over.
"Study"...
I see.
can you go get my camera?
Nishimiya...
Nishimiya!
Shoko!
Why...
Nishimiya, frame!
Starting tomorrow,
Nishimiya...
By the way, Nishimiya, I...
It's cold...
I finally found you.
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san.
It's all my responsibility...
Hey, Nishimiya.
You're totally useless!
Stop it!
I can't open it...
I'm still a coward.
What's this?
Zat'z nod gorregd.
dodally blamed.
I realized,
that death wasn't worth it.
I'm sorry!
She came and took care of you when you were asleep.
Maybe I can't change...
Sho-chan, welcome back!
Yo.
The winter uniform? It suits you.
Well, I'll do my best.
Shoko Nishimiya: Hello
Do your best!
Good luck!
Let's get along.
Hey, isn't that Ishida?
Ya-sho!
If you hadn't woken up,
Please don't care about what happened
never go far and leave me!
This was a prayer for your recovery.
Why's everyone here...
I'm getting fried chicken.
Well,
What? It's not funny at all!
Please write down what I say.
Hey.
I'm Kita, from a special education class.
Sign... language...
Yes?
I'll learn sign language.
I love him so much. He is so handsome.
You're a bad guy.
Yeah, I thought the same thing, too.
Can I take a look?
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!
Yesterday, Nishimiya-san's mother gave us a call.
or been damaged in just five months.
Stand up right now!
And the girls said bad things about her all the time.
Have you been troubling someone?
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!
You're angry, aren't you?!
What do you mean!
Dang it...
Wait!
Hi.
Ah.
You say "why sign language?"
I... and...
Here, Shou-chan.
Huh?!
I knew it!
Your room was vacant, your phone was out of service,
You're stupid, you ungrateful child!
I'll stop. I'm sorry.
Ishida-kun.
Okay.
I just bought the limited edition...
By the way,
What is it?
But I don't want to use any money
You're hungry, huh? Let's have dinner.
Shut up!
I can still go on foot,
but it seems as if I was advised to not go.
Sorry, but
Nothing.
Ah! I'm Nagatsuka!
Ishida-kun.
Well.
This is friendship.
License? No such things are needed.
Nishimiya likes younger guys.
Hey.
I followed you.
You're peeping now, aren't you?
Really?!
Translate it for me!
Feeding them is fun.
Hey!
Hey, boy!
Can I?
"I am very sorry that I jumped into the Suimon River from a bridge,
You'll catch a cold.
What are you doing here?
I'm the one who uploaded the photo.
Oh, you did it.
Don't worry about it.
She's my older sister.
Take these.
Yes.
It's my fault for only bringing one umbrella.
I don't want Nishimiya's boyfriend to get wet.
Do you think that you're a good person?
I see.
Bye!
Why are you here today?
I'm here to return his umbrella.
With friends?
Sahara-san? From elementary school?
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?
Use this.
We're here!
I have heard various news about you from Yuzuru.
I'm pleased to go together today!
Hmm, hmm.
What's your cup size?
Now is the time to "Nyan Nyan Club!"
I'll leave the present here.
Huh?
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?
Why? So weird.
I gave it to her.
Nishimiya-san, long time no see! Are you all right?
Ueno! What are you doing?
Oh, is it a sense of guilt?
You must come.
Oh, sorry.
It's perfectly fine.
I lige moo!
Why are you here today?
What did Nee-chan say?
Moon.
Do you want to come along?
Follow me there!
Oh!
It seems like...
I don't want such unnecessary kindness.
Hi.
Huh? What do you mean?
I hate you.
So let's shake hands, even if we hate each other.
What do you think, Ishida-kun?
What are you saying, Kawai-san?
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...
but he never listened to what I said.
I hate myself, too...
Nao-chan also said so many bad things to Sahara-san.
Don't be in touch, you outsider.
I thought that we were friends.
You always care about your nee-chan,
Yes, of course!
Ishida.
What do you think?
It's my nee-chan. I have to go.
No, thank you.
Then I don't care if you follow me.
Thank you, Ishida.
Coming here is enough.
"Funeral site for Ito Nishimiya"
Let's hang out!
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy
Is that okay?
Get out now..
By the way, Yuzuru.
I submitted some of your photos to the prefecture's photo contest.
But all of the photos are a bit creepy.
By the way, there will be a fireworks festival next Tuesday.
You're already eighteen.
Next year, let's celebrate your birthday together.
But the fireworks aren't over.
I see.
Here it is.
Nishimiya...
Why...
Why, Nishimiya..
Are you still mad?
Oba-san.
I'm sorry for troubling you like this.
Ishida saved my stupid older sister.
All that matters is that Shouko-chan is safe.
keeps everything in their mind.
Oh, Nishimiya-san?
So,
What's this?
Mom!
Nishimiya
I'm glad to know
Everizing would go vell
I talked to you in my dreams.
you to
Sorry, but forget everything, Nishimiya!
Is that Ueno-san?
I heard that you took care of me.
Maybe I can't change...
Welcome back!
No, no, you'll be the cutest in such short hair!
Shou-chan, welcome back!
Welcome to the salon...
I'm sorry.
These items are used like that!
Let's get along.
Honestly, this is the first time that I've told you,
I have a bit of a stomachache.
Ya-shou!
Ya-shou?
never go far and leave me!
Yes, I do.
and I haven't changed a bit.
Don't say that.
Stu-pid!
Woah, it's delicious!
Let's go to the gymnasium next!
"Bank"
Weird!
Give up, give up!
Nishimiya-san,
That's the penalty for saying weird things!
Please let me know what you are talking.
fie-nds...
Yes?
It's easier for me using notebook.
Isn't better to stop that?
No, no, it's what it should be.
You liar!
What!?
See you tomorrow, Shoya.
but Shoya didn't stopped.
What!?
I don't know.
Huh?
What?
What you are doing!
Well...
This is what you left behind.
Sho-tan,
Dig in!
Oh.
I knew something was going on around you!
I'll stop trying to kill myself!
Hey! Mon!
Ouch!
H-hi.
Please finish it soon as the deadline is coming.
"Oh, he is looking at us as always."
I just bought this limited edition, and...
Me too.
But I don't want to use any money
You are hungry, huh? Let's have dinner.
I...I'll lend you my own.
Something very smart,
That's it!
Well...Is Nishimiya-san here?
Friend...
Wh...where was the bike?
It was abandoned in a rice paddy!
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?
What is the definition of "friends"?
Give me your hand.
This is friendship.
Then bye.
Wow, I didn't know he has such a skill.
"I'm glad."
To feed carp.
Why!?
Oops, what is this creepy thing!?
Sorry for dropping the notebook.
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?
Ishida-kun, come to teachers' room right now.
Maria, let's go home now!
Originally I am to be blamed.
Then I'll go home.
It's not mine, my sis's.
Well, please use it now.
Thank you.
I'll give you these.
I had an argument with Shoko.
Oh..
I am to be blamed as I brought only one umbrella.
I see.
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!
Say same thing to Shoko from you, too.
Then?
Do you know phone number or something to contact
as she belongs the same high school as Nao-chan.
When you need travel, meal, and then love hotel expenses,
Sho-chan!
Do you remember me?
I'm sorry.
And surprised.
What kind of school you are going to?
I see.
Where are you going?
Discount coupon!
Oh!
Yeah, I know, I know.
Insect!
Hi, you come here.
By the way, will Nishimiya be pleased if I give this pouch?
Sis, I've got something for you!
...Sis?
What?
Ueno, get off my bike.
Why she has a pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?
Don't make me laugh!
Haha.
Hahaha.
Yuju,
I'm quite awake. So surprised.
What's happened?
Ponytail today? Why?
Oh.
What a weird face!
So many carp. Feeding manpower and bread shorted.
Nishimiya..
Iz mai voize stranze?
...ige...oo...
Agree.
but I'm not sure what are these.
Sis went home as she had a stomachache.
From: Ishida We plan to go to an amusement park,
Ishida.
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?
I was a coward at that time.
Hey, is this hand yours?
My permission is needed when you speak to Ya-sho!
Wait..
But it seems like that..
What are you doing?!
Hey!
Oops.
Don't jump to such a conclusion at your discretion.
Hey, Ueno!
Sis, sorry but take this camera with you.
You always said sorry when something happened.
I...I'b zorry...
Our view was very narrow in the childhood,
You say "I'm sorry" again!?
Did Nishimiya-san have a trouble with her?
Oh, then, I guess,
You say I am spreading what you did in the past!?
It is true.
What!? Nishimiya-san!?
I asked him please to stop doing that,
What's wrong?
No, nothing special.
Hey.
if Ishida-kun apologize first,
That's not proper way.
You should not treat me like yourself.
Completely different from you.
Hey, answer now, Sahara!
I'm not on any side of you two!
Here.
Really?
How about a sweet manju?
as wonderful as you,
Nothing.
I found myself still scared a bit.
What? Why you say sorry now?
What are you going to make?
Hey!
What? Why is this guy here?
Shoko, what do you intend to do?
Get out now..
But I suppose all the photos are kind of creepy ones.
Pff..
Humm, I'd like to pass.
Well, I'll go to buy fried noodles.
Oh thank you.
Basically she had no facial expressions, but..
7th.
Well..
You are 18 years old already.
Oops,
But..
Nishimiya, I'm here.
Here it is.
Huh? oh, we can see fireworks from here.
Please, God..
Crap...
Sis made pancakes for you.
Hi, ma'am.
Ishida-san.
Please.
Stop it!
for the first time.
So,
you are visiting around to meet members at the bridge.
You are strong...
I couldn't change myself.
What's this?
Get rid of this!
Ha.
I'm ok now too
Nishimiya-san.
Well, Nishimiya.
I want to apologize to others, too.
Nishimiya.
What a creepy things I just did!
Oops!
You die? die? dieeeeeee?
And, It was Shimada and Hirose,
who saved you when you fell into the river.
Huh, h...hello.
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!
Bye! Cheer up!
Huh? The jumping-into guy?
I have difficulty even looking everyone in the eyes.
I'm feeling like a kind of stomachache.
Nagatsuka---kun?
for so many things.
This is.. "thousand paper cranes"
but I couldn't it is far less than a thousand...
Oh...Ishida-kun.
Pff!
Then you can see I am here in front of you
How many times I cried
Thank you for everything.
Once more, from the top.
Forget about winning the choir competition.
Let's leave.
Bye bye, Nishimiya.
Have you all heard of sign language?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Don't say that, Nao!
Wow, Nishimiya's funny.
Is she for real?
Yes, of course!
Shoya.
What were you doing, you creep?!
What?
Nishimiya transferred out.
Nishimiya!
I came to give this back.
...!
What're you grinning for?
But it really made me happy.
By the way, Sho...
I knew it.
I knew something was off!
I won't try to kill myself!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
i1I found myself all alone.
Morning.
i1Doesn't he get lonely, being all alone all the time?
I bought this on release day.
i1Who was he, again?
i1But man, who do I think I am?
I'll earn it again.
i1It's not like I can't walk there,
i1but I feel like the universe is telling me not to go.
I need a really neat, natural-sounding excuse.
Nothing.
Ishida!
What's your name?
Ishida!
Let's go hang out after school today.
Wait, Yasho?
Makes us seem like big friends, right?
I think friendship defies logic or words.
She's not here.
For the bread, not me.
Nagatsuka?
Excuse me? What's your problem?
Oh, no.
Don't fall, laddy.
Jumped in...
What was that for?
Did you see this?
Shoya!
Time to go home, Maria.
You have a daughter?
Where's Sis?
Go ahead.
What are you doing?
Trying to make yourself feel better by helping a stray?
You're disgusting.
I have no right to live.
Okay.
How are you doing?
Huh?
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
I just need to visit the restroom.
Take one.
Should I keep going and have Ueno meet Nishimiya too?
Crap. He really came.
Well, you know...
A-And what about you?
Don't be stupid.
Go, go!
Wait, what?
Long time no see.
Let's hang out sometime.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Isn't that a pouch from my workplace?
What are you doing, Ueno?
Friends? That's hilarious!
You don' have do buy
It's fine, really.
Thanks.
It is very pretty today.
She went home, saying her tummy hurt.
What did she say?
Yeah!
Here we go, then!
Oh, yeah.
You know sign language?
You're being rude to my Yasho!
You're funny, Nagatsuka.
i1You know, like a group of friends!
H-Hey, wait.
Thank you.
Wait.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.
But I do.
Probably.
I hate you.
And anytime something happened, you'd immediately apologize.
Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.
What the hell is up with that?
So what?
What are you saying, Kawai?
I never badmouthed Nishimiya.
You ok
Heya.
Sorry about earlier.
Unlike me, you went out of your way to bully Nishimiya.
I shouldn't have come.
And here I thought we were friends.
All you care about is your sister.
Shoko's hanging in there too.
Grandma...
Isn't she coming today?
Ishida.
Hang in there, Yuzuru.
i1This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.
Hey.
Should I really be here?
What are you trying to pull?
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.
June 7th?
Oh, is that so?
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
You see, Shoko...
We caused you trouble once again.
Quit trying to be some tragic heroine!
Say something.
so I tried to commit suicide.
You're a cancer, Nishimiya.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Why?
Soww...
I'm so sowwy!
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
I destroyed everything Ishida had built up
Yasho accepted a weirdo like me.
Yasho's my big friend, so I really need him to wake up.
I want to fix what I destroyed
We were so worried!
Nihimiya!
Nishimiya,
I'm sorry.
That was probably all.
But I hurt you
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
Oh, Shimada and Hirose were the ones who pulled you up when you fell.
Well, I'm out.
Hello, and make yourself at home.
I'm off.
Shall we?
The one who was hospitalized?
So I feel much better when I look down.
I can walk just fine.
I actually meant to look you straight in the eye.
Those things happen in life.
Nagatsuka...
Oh, forget it.
She was too embarrassed.
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.
I'd like us to check out the festival together.
God, this is seriously yummy!
Please empty the account.Alt: I'd like to withdraw the entire balance.
You're such a creep!kametsu: You're gross!
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.
Have you all heard of sign language?
Ta...
Aren't her clothes lame as hell?
You bad boy.Alt: You're the worst, man. Literally: "Bad guy"
Looking good!
All gone.
We're in the middle of class.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
Before you end up causing any more trouble for your parents...
Are you causing trouble for others?
What the heck?
That's that.
Um, remember me?kametsu: U-Uh...
Oh.
Could we be friends?
I finally understand what she meant.
i1Sho-tan!
Have a nice day.
I knew it.
Don't be stupid.
I mean it!
Good.
It's a promise, okay?
W-Water! Water!kametsu: W-Water!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
What have I done?
I will, sorry.
Figures.
See, I was right.
But I wouldn't want the money you earned in order to die, anyway.
i1Tuesday...
Dude, just let it go.
Help me!
Huh? For real?
There was just a rat out there.
This is your bike, right?
It's nothing.kametsu: N-Nothing
Feel free to tell me.
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.More literally: I'm going out with Shoko.
Goodbye.
Excuse me? What's your problem?
Hey, look.
Isn't that Yuzuru-chan?
Oh no, they're fighting.
Nagatsukafscx150
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun!
Ow!
Wait, you know sign language?
Bread. For the carp.
What?!
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?
I'll be going, then.
She's my sister's!
Say aah!
Go ahead.
What are you doing?
Seriously.
Oh, you...
Wanna wear these?
I had a fight with Shoko.
Of course Nishimiya's told you.
I'm sorry.
I'm back.
I'm sorry too.
Tell Shoko too.
I got a cellphone.Hesitation 300ms earlier but barely audible. kametsu: I-I got a cellphone.
Sa... ha... ra?
But Mashiba-kun...
Ishida-kun, take this.
You'll need to pay for travel, food, and a love hotel.
You'd feel a lot better if you had this much.
Nee-chan was pissed off you were leaving her out even though she was the one who asked.
I've kept studying sign language.
Huh...
Ueno?
I couldn't do the things she does.
Should I keep going and have Ueno meet Nishimiya too?
i1What? Not happening.
O-One hour, please.
Let's hang out sometime.
I gave it to her.
Friends? That's hilarious!
Id monig.
Hang on, Nishimiya.
Can I open it?
Why'd you change it?
Why, you ask?
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
Is she avoiding me?
She's acting awfully friendly.
Ueno? Why?
Can I sit with you, Sahara-san?
Here we go, then!
Though I am still terrified.
Hey! What's with your hand?
Don't touch me!
Ishida.
You don't need to play peacemaker.
I was just hoping you two could go back to being friends.
Nobody asked you.
Didn't I do the exact same thing?
Take this with you, Nee-chan.
i1I'll talk slowly so you can understand,
i1They were signs to stay away from me.
i1Everything around us fell apart.
i1I still hate you,
i1I hade mysel.
Yeah.
Calm down, Kawai-san.
That's right! Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san!
Yasho?
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun.
You've got it wrong, Nao-chan.
Ah.
Mean!
See you.
Are you still worried about your sister?
Then I'm doing it for myself too.
I've been blessed with truly amazing granddaughters.
Hey, Yuzufscx150
It's from Nee-chan. Gotta go.
Don't start talking like my grandma.
Do whatever you want.
Ishida.
Oh, wow!
i1was me.
I wanna see the ocean.
What are you making?
Should I really be here?
What's the big deal? It's a happy occasion.
You look good.
Will this spot be okay?Alt's: spot do?; spot work?
Thanks.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
Oh, is that so?
W-Wait a second.
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
i1I'll look at people's faces.
i1Sho-chan.
i1I'm gonna see the fireworks!
Ma'am!
I finally got to see you.
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
What are you doing?
What was I supposed to do?
You gan jange from now,
They asked me not to tell you, but screw that.
Sure.
My daughter's husband. He came back.
Yuzu-chan's upstairs.
I'm sorry I said all those mean things.
I'm off.
Who?
The other dayfscx150
It's fine. Hand them over.
You too, Mashiba-kun.
So?
Watch your mouth, Nao.
Same as Ishida, then.
These will be on the upcoming quiz.
Finally, there's the load that is raised or lowered.
Take this seriously, Ishida.Alt: Ishida, stop joking around.
What?
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.
You can have entire conversations with just hand gestures.
Ta...
Who cares?
Yikes, who did this?
What is that?
Nishimiya, are you all right?
What? Move.
Er...
Huh?!
Nishimiya!
Um, remember me?kametsu: U-Uh...
Me and you...
Morning, Maria.
Thanks for the food.
Well, uh, a lot's happened...kametsu: W-Well, a lot happened...
i1But...
Morning.
Ishida.
i1I bought this on release day.
Sho...
I'm asking you because I don't have one!
You can take mine.
Look at this! Look at this!
I'm glad it had your address on it.
Dumped in a paddy field.
Want some, Nagatsuka?
We're best friends.
Nishimiya likes younger boys?
What are you doing here?
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
I dare you to say that again!
Stop it.
Wait, you know sign language?
Right. Here, Nishimiya.
Wait, Nishimiya!
Huh? What's this?
Ishida, come to the staff room.
Not happening, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
Oh, that was you?
I had it coming.
You have a daughter?
What are you doing?
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Hey, you're hurting me.
Sis, you'll get wet.
Tell Shoko too.
both Sis and me.
She's Nishimiya's little sister.
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?
Sorry, I have no idea.
I brought her.
Sho!
I just need to visit the restroom.
Take one.
We're giving out discount coupons!
I couldn't do the things she does.
W-We have a discount coupon.
an8Seriously?
Crap. He really came.
Is she here?
Things are pretty awkward right now.
U...
Wait, what?
Long time no see.
Let's hang out sometime.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Isn't that a pouch from my workplace?
Long time no see, Nishimiya!
Are you two going out?
These?
Doesn't seem like they're candy.
Cut it out, guys.
That's how it goes with girls.
Long time no see, Miyo!
Is she avoiding me?
What did she say?
Well, if you're worried she's avoiding you, ask her to hang out.
Are you all ready?would normally an8 this but for sake of next line
When I was in grade school, I was too scared to ride a roller coaster.
I was a coward, you see.
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.
Stop it!kametsu: S-Stop it! Dub: Knock it off!
Run away, Mashiba!
Huh? H-Hey, wait.
Sorry! I'll text you!
No, we're not.
The thing with Shimada...
Huh?
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
Video of the Ferris wheel?
i1I had no understanding of you or your situation.
i1So I changed my approach.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1Let's shake hands as two people who hate each other.
That can't be...
But he just wouldn't listen.
i1Yeah, I hate myself too.
Something wrong?
We?
Ah.
I was only telling the truth!
You don't have to put it like that.
Yasho...
I'm on your side, okay.
Yasho...
I shouldn't have come.
Then I'm doing it for myself too.
Your heart is pure.
I will!
I got some really nice bread today.
I saw you crying earlier.
I'll be fine from here.
Ishida.
I'm still scared.
I wanna love people.
Wait, what?
Yeah. You think she was happy?
Why...
Oh, you can see him now.
Uh, I'm very sorry.
piss me off the most!
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
Stop it!
You have to learn to love even the things you hate about yourself and move forward.
I'm not as strong as you.
I'm still the same old coward.
You gan jange from now,
Nihimiya!
Nishimiya...
Hey.
Nishimiya,
Nishimiya,
That was probably all.
You fell becas I couldn jange!
If only I were gone...
Ishida...
Welcome back.
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
How're you doing?
N-Nah, it's amazing!
This is plenty!
She was too embarrassed.
There. Nice to meet you.
Sho, huh?
First up, the fulcrum. It's the point that supports the lever.
Ow, that hurts.
Screw you too, four-eyes.
All right.
Frens...
Have you all heard of sign language?
Isn't it amazing?
Stop that.
Come on, Ishida.
Right. I was wondering about that too.
What do we do?
That four-eyes really pisses me off.
What? Move.
Before you end up causing any more trouble for your parents...
Yes, I understand.
Yeah, it's true!
Be a good boy from tomorrow.
Huh?
That look again?
What? If you got something to say, say it!
I'm dryig, ju no!
Nishimiya!
Uh...
You forgot this.
Hey...
Morning, Maria.
So I was right!
Your phone was off!
I won't do it!
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
W-Water! Water!kametsu: W-Water!
I will, sorry.
i1Oh, he's looking this way again.
See, I was right.
i1Who was he, again?
i1She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.
What is it?
I'll earn it again.
She's not here.
Nothing.
Is something wrong, Yasho?
Say, Nagatsuka...
And requirements can kiss my ass.
Well, that sucks.
an8Hey, Nagatsuka...
Nagatsukafscx150
No, you're wrong...
Uh...
What's wrong?
Why?!
Did you see this?
Sorry, but could you go pick up Maria?
Time to go home, Maria.
Hey!
I'm hungry!
I'll be going, then.
Here, umbrella.
Knew it.
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.
Why'd you run away from home?
I had a fight with Shoko.
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...
I'm sorry too.
Sa... ha... ra?
Yasho, Yasho.
So?
I think you're really responsible, though.
Remember Sahara from grade school? Do you know how to contact her?
since Nao goes there too.kametsu: Nao goes there. Alt: since it's the same oneschool Nao-chan goes to.
Huh?
Hey!
Let's see... We walk from here...
Huh? Ishida?
I'm really glad to see you again.
Really?
What's your cup size?
Welcome!
Things are pretty awkward right now.
Still alone, I see.
The poor thing.
Isn't that a pouch from my workplace?
Hey!
We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.
Huh? Hang on a sec.
You've gotten really lame, Ishida.
Nishimiya?
These?
Say, Nagatsuka.
For real?!
Wow, you changed your hairstyle.
Really? But it looks nice.
No special reason, really.
Here we go, then!
Oh no, not good!
Are you mad?
Nobody asked you.
No, we're not.
Don't just assume that.Kametsu: We don't know that.
i1So I changed my approach.
i1Y-You're wrog.
i1What the heck?
i1In the end, things are the same as five years ago.
I want Nishimiya to come to love herself.
I can't stand stuff like that.
Chill. You're being too loud.
You were and still are a colossal jerk!
That's right! Ishida bullied Nishimiya!
Oh, Ishida.
I called her.
You've got it wrong, Nao.
Nao badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara!
Enough.
You don't have to put it like that.
Sho.
Ishida, you're too awful.
And here I thought we were friends.
Are you still worried about your sister?
All you care about is your sister.
You're not at all trying to figure out who you are as a person.
Is that so?
Wait, that's weird.
Hey, Yuzufscx150
Right, Yuzuru?
Where are we going tomorrow?
Are you crazy?!
That looks great!2 Speakers
What are you doing?
Yuzuru.
Yum!
Sho said you should take part.
That's not what I found.
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
What's up?
But...
Pardon me...
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya!
i1Sorry.
Let go together. Come see him.kametsu: Come with me. Let him see your face. No English person would say this.
You too, Yuzuru.
What are you doing?
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
He made me realize for the first time what a best friend was.
You have to learn to love even the things you hate about yourself and move forward.
I'm glad you're all right.
Tahada...
i1Boo!
Nishimiya,
More or less.
I'm sorry.
I hadn't actually apologized to you for what I did to you in the past.
I wanted to talk to you more.
But I hurt you
You fell becas I couldn jange!
I was talking to you before coming here.
I'd felt the same way as you forever,
Sorry! Forget that!kametsu: S-Sorry! Forget it!
This suits you much better.
That's right. My son is invincible.
Looks good.
Wow, are you serious? That's crazy!
Well, I'll give it my best shot.
Let's do this!
What?
Isn't that Ishida?
I can walk just fine.
Ishida?
Yasho!
Hey, Yasho.
Don't worry about what happened on the bridge!
Also, thank you.
You got them?
Here.
Well, I guess that's just who you are.
Oh, forget it.
I'll go get some fried chicken.
We have a new friend joining us today.
Listen up.
Hey, can you speak Japanese?
Nice.
Nishimiya.
Start from here.
Let's leave.
What?
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.
would you spend three minutes of homeroom each morning learning sign language?
Nishimiya...
Really? I think it's just right.
Let's go.
She's crazy.
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Huh?!
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
Right?
He made her cry...
Yes, of course!
Goodbye.
Wait, why are you soaking wet?
Hold on!
Get ready.
Um, remember me?kametsu: U-Uh...
I'm Ishida Shoya.
Huh?
Uh...
Have a nice day.
I mean...
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?
You even sold off your manga, clothes, and bed.
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
Hey! You listening to me?!
It's a promise, okay?
Hey, Mom!
i1Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.
You guys better stay away from that Ishida Shoya.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Ishida Shoya.  italics?
i1and that I had to bear that cross and the punishment that came with it.
Yes?
i1Why does he even live, then?
i1Can I really go see Nishimiya again?
i1She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.
You must be starving.
Starving!
i1Who, me?
Dude, just let it go.
Somebody help!
i1I didn't get it back.
She's not here.
She's right there.
What's wrong, Ishida-kun?
Morning.
Ishida-kun.
Let's go hang out after school today.
To mark the start of our friendship.
I think friendship defies logic or words.
Well, that sucks.
For the bread, not me.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
What's going on?
Stop it.
I felt like I shouldn't come see you.
Hey, laddy!
Ishida-kun jumped into the river?!
Sorry I dropped it.
What the heck? Isn't that Ishida-kun?
This is you, right?
Time to go home, Maria.
You'll catch a cold.
About what?
Boy, am I ever glad it was you.
Nah, I can't.
You have a daughter?
Ow!
Knew it.
You can have them.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
Hold the umbrella over yourself.
Well, I should've brought two.
But this also concerns me.
Later.
I'm sorry too.
Tell Shoko too.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
You're pretty responsible.
Yeah, I knew that all along.
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
What?
But Mashiba-kun...
Taiyo Girls Academy.
I'm really sorry.
I've been worried about you ever since.
What's your cup size?
Ueno?
We're giving out discount coupons!
Right. Your friend...
U...
Wait, what?
Oh, yeah.
Isn't that Nishimiya?
What? I'll pass.
You hate me, don't you?
Oh, really?
What are you doing, Ueno?
You're kidding me, Ishida.
How? Why?
Is it out of guilt or something?
Nah.
Why...?
What a weird face.
Ishida needs to see this.
For me?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Canfscx150
What?! For real?!
I was just running short on time.
Oh.
Why are you here?
Don't go over my head!
I'm kinda scared.
I learn so much from her artistic sense.
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
Hey!
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!
Sh-Shimada?
Ishida!
I'm not mad.
Hey.
Don't just assume that.Kametsu: We don't know that.
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
i1But you never tried to understand me, either.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1You're not even trying to talk to me.
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun.
Nao-chan...
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
Nao-chan badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara-san!
It's okay.
I shouldn't have come.
Yuzu?
Like you're any better.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
And I haven't gone to school in forever.
Have some sweet bean dumplings.
Guess I'll go home.
I'm still scared.
i1was me.
I wanna love people.
Hey, Nishimiya.
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
Oh, and thank you for inviting me over the other day.
So you're already eighteen, huh?
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
They moved him to a ward room today.
Nishimiya-san?
Otherwise...
I'm just glad Shoko-chan's all right.
Why did Ishida have to get hurt?!
Soww...
Nishimiya,
Oh, right.
You fell becas I couldn jange!
Id all my fauld!
I was talking to you before coming here.
We've reached your destination, sir.
Oh, Shimada and Hirose were the ones who pulled you up when you fell.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Sho-chan.
You started going to school, huh?
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
Shall we?
Isn't that Ishida?
Who?
Nishimiya...
Is the water ready?
Yasho?
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?
Yasho, why are you looking down?
Hey, Yasho.
I'm so glad you're all right!
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
I'm sorry about everything.
I asked everyone, but...
I'm sorry.
You apologized again.
Okay, introduce yourself.
There. Nice to meet you.
Watch your mouth, Nao.
Okay, note down the following sections.
These will be on the upcoming quiz.
You, um, went too early.
Once more, from the top.
Ow, that hurts.
Forget it. Next.
What?
It's a language where you use your hands.
Don't say that, Nao!
Who cares?
Nishimiya, are you all right?
I'm not!
Later, Shoya.
Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.
Ueno.
Well, I did tell him to stop.
Huh?!
Yes, of course!
Shoya!
What are you saying?!
Nishimiya transferred out.
That's that.
Nishimiya!
Hey.
Though you might not want to see it.
Hey...
Could we be friends?
Don't cry.
Goodbye, Mommy.
Have a nice day.
Well, uh, a lot's happened...kametsu: W-Well, a lot happened...
Your phone was off!
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
If you don't promise not to kill yourself, I'll burn this up.
I'll burn the 1.7 million yen you shed blood, sweat, and tears to earn!
Don't be stupid.
I won't do it!
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
Have you submitted your math notebook yet?
Better get on that, then.
Seriously?
i1Will he spend his whole life like that?
i1Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
For burning all that money you earned.
i1Tuesday...
I want to go get it.
Stop it.
i1Is it a sign that I shouldn't go see her?
Goodbye.
Oh, there he is.
What's your name?
Morning.
Is something wrong, Yasho?
She's not.
For the bread, not me.
Are we done here?
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
You turd-head.
Sorry, Nagatsuka!
Crap!
I'm happy for you, Ishida.
Wait, Nishimiya!
W-What was that for?
Sho!
Where are your shoes?
Oh, that was you?
I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.
Great.
Wanna wear these?
You can have them.
I had a fight with Shoko.
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
And I can't let you catch a cold, for Nishimiya's sake.
Man...
It's all just a bit of fun for you, isn't it?kametsu: "I know you made fun..." Not quite what she's saying, I've translated it more true to the JP. Alt less literal but a good translation of the idea: It's all just fun and games for you, isn't it?
What the heck?
This is far enough.
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Now you know.
Later.
Wow, laddy.
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.
I see. I could tell you...
Huh, what the heck? I don't need that much.
Sho!
It's me, Sahara!
I've been worried about you ever since.
Let me check!
We're giving out discount coupons!
I couldn't do the things she does.
Welcofscx150
O-One hour, please.
W-We have a discount coupon.
an8Seriously?
Crap. He really came.
Cat!
Still alone, I see.
Sorry about grade school.
Why does she have it? Scary.
Oh, really?
Wait, wait. Before that...
What the heck are these?
Hey, Kawai.
Nice to meet you. I'm Sahara.
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
She's acting awfully friendly.
Though I am still terrified.
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
What are you doing?
You don't need to play peacemaker.
I was just hoping you two could go back to being friends.
Nobody asked you.
I want to go back to how things were before Nishimiya came.Alt: I want things back to how it was before she came.
It's all on me.
I'm riding the roller coaster again.
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.
i1I'll talk slowly so you can understand,
i1Are you going to apologize again?
Sorry, Nagatsuka.
Nao?
Neither of you!
Shut up, Sahara.
Yasho...
Right.
I'm doing it for myself, so it doesn't count.
Why?
I'll walk you. Where to?
Why?
Ishida.
Your mission is to help us bake a birthday cake for our mother.
That's not what I found.
You need to study?
You can see the fireworks from here...?
Nishimiya!
i1Did I ever actually apologize to her?
i1So cold...
And the hospital said no visits.
Oh, you can see him now.
You see, Shokofscx150
Nishimiya?
Soww...
Shall we head someplace else? I'll get you a drink.
Nishimiya...
Nishimiya...
Hey.
Nishimiya,
but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.
Forget what I just said!
Oh, no...
My daughter's husband. He came back.
You started going to school, huh?
Thanks, Nishimiya.
Ishida?
Sorry.
Yasho, why are you looking down?
Did I get cold feet?
If you...
Come on, you two.
How can he come to school?
Lucky you, Ishida.
Uh...
Same as Ishida, then.
Pages 20 through 25, and the practice problems on page 32.
Forget about winning the choir competition.
I'll copy my notes for you later.
Start from here.
Take this seriously, Ishida.Alt: Ishida, stop joking around.
Using sign language would make things much easier for Shoko.
Don't say that, Nao!
Come on, Ishida.
If you're wearing these, can you actually hear?
Right. I was wondering about that too.
Ueno.
Nishimiya, are you all right?
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!
Well, I did tell him to stop.
Shoya.
Huh?
What was that for?
I'm dryig, ju no!
I didn't get the log.
And who was on flower duty?
Hello there, Shoko.
Nishimiya!
I'm Ishida Shoya.
Nishimiya?
Anyway, here.
What am I saying?
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.
i1Sho!
Eat up.
Ow!
Morning.
All right, then.
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
i1Ishida's always by himself, huh?
i1Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
i1But more importantly...
i1Maybe I could go apologize for making her cry?
My, thank you.
i1Who, me?
Help me!
i1And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.
i1Is it a sign that I shouldn't go see her?
i1It's not like I can't walk there,
I need a really neat, natural-sounding excuse.
I-Is Nishimiya here?
A super creepy one.
Oh, there he is.
I'm glad it had your address on it.
Is something wrong, Yasho?
Look, Yasho.
How stupid.
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.
Wow, that's kinda unexpected.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
Why, you...
Sorry, Nagatsuka!
Ishida...
Uh...
Is feeding them fun?
Wait, Nishimiya!
What?!
Huh? What's this?
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?
Where are your shoes?
I had a fight with Shoko.
Hold the umbrella over yourself.
Well, I should've brought two.
Man...
Now you know.
Later.
Sis, you'll get wet.
From your high school?
I think you're really responsible, though.
Um,
Hey!
I'm really sorry.
Take one.
What exactly were you hoping for?
I'm only here to meet your friend. No dirty thoughts whatsoever.
We're not exactly friends...
Elaborate.
Long time no see.
The poor thing.
Seriously, Ishida. It's been ages.
I've always felt I should've reached out to you.
What are you doing, Ueno?
No way.
Why...?
To the baker's.
See you.
...moo.
Do these look like the moon to you?
Long time no see, Miyo!
Why is she taking charge?
Are you all ready?would normally an8 this but for sake of next line
Yeah!2 Speakers
Wow.
You know sign language?
You're funny, Nagatsuka.
Stop it!kametsu: S-Stop it! Dub: Knock it off!
What are you doing?
I was just hoping you two could go back to being friends.
Don't just assume that.Kametsu: We don't know that.
But it's the truth, isn't it?Kametsu: But I do.
I'm riding the roller coaster again.
i1But instead of picking up on them, you fired back.
i1It's not like I want you to apologize.
i1So what?
What do you think?
Kawai said things were complicated in grade school.
Calm down, Kawai.
But he just wouldn't listen.
Mean!
I hate that line of thinking.
You're just gonna run and regret it again, since you're a coward.
Oh, buzz off. You don't know the first thing about me.
Here.
Like you're any better.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
Is that so?
How do I look?
Do whatever you want.
Thanks, Ishida.
Okay, Nishimiya?
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
Not tomorrow. We have plans.
That's not what I found.
Who asked you two?
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya?
Please...
piss me off the most!
Stop it.
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya.
Oh, right.
If only I were gone...
It looked like I was trying to give up on everything.
but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
I want you... to help me...
Oh wait...kametsu: "H-Huh?" It is more literal but lacks translating the idea realization
They asked me not to tell you, but screw that.
Welcome back.
This suits you much better.
Who is that?
Wow, are you serious? That's crazy.
Sure.
How've you been?
Nothing.
Morning.
The jumper?
Nishimiya...
Yasho!
Ishida!
I'm so glad you're all right!
Oh.
Here.
I asked everyone, but...
What's your problem, Kawai? You wanna go?
I'm the same.
May I?
Count me in.
There. Nice to meet you.
Uh...
Sho-chan, huh?
Her nickname's Sho-chan.
What? Not nice.
Finally, there's the load that is raised or lowered.
Ow, that hurts.
Y'know...
Nishimiya.
How does this sound?
Sa.
And a star.
There.
Let's bounce.
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Huh?!
He made her cry...
What were you doing, you creep?!
I don't understand that stupid look,
What are you saying?!
She really pisses me off...
I didn't get the log.
From sixth grade.
Nishimiya?
Uh...
Though you might not want to see it.
Me and you...
Here you go, Sho-chan.
If you don't promise not to kill yourself, I'll burn this up.
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!
Hey, Mom!
He's a bully.
i1I realized that your sins always come back to bite you,
What is it?
Let go!
Huh? For real?
She's not here.
Man, I had to look everywhere.
Oh, uh...
Want some, Nagatsuka-kun?
Ishida-kun!
What are friends, anyway?Borderline keyframe snap. I think it looks better snapped as there's plenty of time to read this short line, but it comes down to personal preference.
She's not.
If you're here just to make yourself feel better, please leave.
Are we done here?
I guess turds of a feather drop together.
Turd-head, turd-head, turd-head!
They're fighting.
Probably using sign language.
Right. Here, Nishimiya.
Bread. For the carp.
Why?!
Shoko's such a fool.
Come on, you can go for a bit.
You okay?
Yell at me, dude.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
Wanna wear these?
So, like, relationship problems and all that?
Trying to make yourself feel better by helping a stray?
I have no right to live.
Later.
Oh, you're Nishimiya-san's mother...
Tell Shoko, too.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
What brings you here today?
This is my friend Nagatsuka.
From your high school?
So?
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
I think you're really responsible, though.
Nao-chan goes there, too.
Huh, what the heck? I don't need that much.
Let's see... We walk from here...
Sho-chan!
I left all of a sudden...
Yeah, yeah.
Ueno?
All right.
Long time no see.
Is it out of guilt or something?
Well, have fun playing friends.
Yeah?
I'm up. Too surprised to sleep.
For me?
Can I open it?
Thanks.
I lub moo!more like like but I guess this works
Why'd you change your hairstyle?
I learn so much from her artistic sense.
When I was in grade school, I was too scared to ride a roller coaster.
Hey, what're youfscx150
No, we're not.
Hey.
And you and Shimada wouldn't have fallen out.
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru-chan.
Shoya's upstairs.
i1And anytime something happened, you'd immediately apologize.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1and you hate me.
i1What the heck?
Ueno-san, was it?
Kawai-san said things were complicated in grade school.
What're you talking about?
Nishimiya-san?
But he just wouldn't listen.
But it was all your fault to begin with.
Ah.
Yeah, I'm not.
Mean!
I-I...
Stop thinking you can decide everything for others.
You don't have to put it like that.
All you've ever cared about is yourself.
Yasho...
See you.
I shouldn't have come.
You think?
I will.
Why?
Do whatever you want.
What are you doing?
Yuzuru.
Nah, I'll pass.
Come with me, Mom.
Was your mother...
Yeah. You think she was happy?
I couldn't tell from her poker face.
Whoa, it's dark.
Why...
i1I beg you, God.
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1I'll look at people's faces.
i1From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.
i1Sho-chan.
i1Your sister made pancakes.
i1Yet so warm...
And the hospital said no visits.
Ishida-san.
I caused everyone trouble and was really hurt by it,
Are you her mother?!
What was I supposed to do?
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya-san.
I'm glad you're okay.
Nishimiya,
I'm sorry.
I was talking to you before coming here.
...live.
isn't that Ueno-san?
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya-san.
Thanks for having me.
W-Welcome.
I'm sorry.
Looks good.
Please tutor me!
I'm sorry I said all those mean things.
Is that how they're used?
What?
Yasho?
I actually meant to look you straight in the eye.
I'm sorry about everything.
Yasho.
I heard Nagatsuka-kun screaming out your name.
And I'm sorry.
Yikes. So gross.
Why do you have to be like that?
Oh, forget it.
How can he come to school?
Listen up.
Huh?
Okay, note down the following sections.
We're screwed.
Ow!
Start from here.
Frens...
Um,
Ta...
Right?
Hirose, take that side.
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
Huh?
What the heck?
Remember me?
Wait!
i1Sho!
What're you grinning for?
I mean...
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?
All the pages were ripped off from April...
If you don't promise not to kill yourself, I'll burn this up.
What won't you do? Spell it out!
He's a bully.
i1And then...
All right, then.
Wanna go to the courtyard?
i1Same.
It's true!
Take your time.
You can take mine.
i1And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.
i1but I feel like the universe is telling me not to go.
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
Uh, she's right there.
but are you really friends with her?
I sit behind you, you know.
Oh, right. This is good bread.
To mark the start of our friendship.
Well, that sucks.
So, huh...
Nagatsuka?
I followed you.
Nagatsuka...
Nagatsukafscx150
Ow!
Oh, crap!
I was searching for a reason to meet you.
I was thinking the same thing.
Ishida jumped into the river?!
Sorry I dropped it.
Yell at me, dude.
Sho!
Where's Sis?
It's good!
Just take it.
Knew it.
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.
This is far enough.
I'm sorry, too.
Will you go see this Sahara?
I think you're really responsible, though.
Huh?
Crap. He really came.
Bug!
I'm coming in, Sis!
Go, go!
What? I'll pass.
I've always felt I should've reached out to you.
I gave it to her.
Of course not.
I can't. This is too funny.
Nah.
Nishimifscx150
Kinda.
It's fine, really.
Yeah.
N-Nishimiya?
Do these look like the moon to you?
For real?!
Wow, you changed your hairstyle.
Did something happen?
Why, you ask?
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?
Of course...
Let's line up for that one first, everyone!
Follow me, and don't fall behind!
Why is she taking charge?
Are you all ready?would normally an8 this but for sake of next line
Wow.
You're being rude to my Yasho!
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
Ishida.
No, we're not.
i1But you never tried to understand me, either.
i1Everything around us fell apart.
That's right! Ishida bullied Nishimiya!
Sorry, Nagatsuka.
I brought your bag.
Sorry about earlier.
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed and fell in line with what I was doing!
It's all my fault.
Not another word, Kawai.
I'm on your side, okay.
Sho.
Shoko's hanging in there, too.
I've been blessed with truly amazing granddaughters.
So...
Why?
Do whatever you want.
Oh, wow!
i1This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.
I wanna see the ocean.
Hey, Nishimiya!
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
Right, Yuzuru?
Hey...
We did it, Sis.
I picked a photo and submitted it to the prefectural photography contest.
Wait, what?
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
Yeah.
But...
Pardon me...
I'm coming in.
Shoko!
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1I'll look at people's faces.
Otherwise...
I was too negligent.
Please, I beg you.
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!
I'm sowwy...
What are you doing?
She's holding it shut!
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya.
You gan jange from now,
More or less.
That was probably all.
If only I were gone...
But that wasn't right.
...live.
I'm not dead, Maria.
I hear you came to visit.
Ishida.
My daughter's husband. He came back.
Please tutor me!
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
Nothing.
This is my class.
Ishida!
I beg you!
I'm sorry about everything.
Here.
Yikes. So gross.
I'm sorry.
Empty the account.
Lucky you, Ishida.
Okay, introduce yourself.
Do you have a nickname?
Then there's the effort, force that's applied at one point.
I'll tell you when to start, okay?
Forget about winning the choir competition.
Start from here.
Take this seriously, Ishida.Alt: Ishida, stop joking around.
Bye bye, Nishimiya-san.
You need to be smarter about things, or people will start to hate you.
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.
And it's much easier for me to write.
Um,
Keep scoring them brownie points.
Nishimiya...
There.
All gone.
We're in the middle of class.
Lemme go! You're creeping me out!
It's about Nishimiya Shoko-san, who's absent today.
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have been lost or broken.
Ishida...
Look, we all know it was you.
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
Especially Ueno and Kawai.
I would never do that!
Yes, I understand.
Yes, of course!
Goodbye.
What were you doing, you creep?!
and it pisses me off!
What's with you?
What are you saying?!
I came to give this back.
Don't cry.
Wake up, Sho-chan!
Eat up.
I mean...
W-Well, a lot happened...
Hey, Mom!
W-Water!
Better get on that, then.
Wanna go to the courtyard?
i1Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
i1Same.
Figures.
You must be starving.
i1Tuesday...
i1an8Oh, it's that guy.
Somebody help!
She's not.
There he is.
Ishida-kun!
Ishida-kun.
Makes us seem like big friends, right?
You know, does one need to fulfill any requirements to be a friend?
I think friendship defies logic or words.
What are you doing here?
Nagatsuka-kun!
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun!
Hmm?
Probably using sign language.
Wait, you know sign language?
Ishida-kun jumped into the river?!
Nishimiya.
Hey...
This is you, right?
Not happening, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
Where are your shoes?
Coming.
You should go home soon, too.
Where's Sis?
Seriously.
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.
What the heck?
Hey, you're hurting me.
I knew that all along.
But Mashiba-kun...
Nao-chan goes there, too.
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.
Sho-chan!
Huh?
Sho-chan!
It's me, Sahara!
I've been worried about you ever since.
Really?
Take one.
Crap. He really came.
Right. Your friend...
I came to play with Maria.
Gift for you. I'll leave it here.
U...
Seriously, Ishida. It's been ages.
I gave it to her.
Huh? Hang on a sec.
Nothing, really.
Yuduwu.
Yuzuru asked me to buy some bread for the carp.
Do I dalk weerd?
N-Nishimiya?
Doesn't seem like they're candy.
You look great!
That's how it goes with girls.
What?
Why?
Oh, that would've really annoyed her.
i1Here we go, then!
When I was in grade school, I was too scared to ride a roller coaster.
Your legs are shaking, Sho-chan.kametsu: Your legs are all wobbly, Sho.
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
i1Is this really okay...
Huh? H-Hey, wait.
Sh-Shimada?
Do you hate me?
Video of the Ferris wheel?
i1I had no understanding of you or your situation.
i1That's why you'd obliviously hand over your stupid notebook,
i1But I'm not about to tell you we should be friends now.
i1Y-You're wrog.
Ch-Chill. You're being too loud.
It's true!
You badmouthed her yourself.
You ok
i1Yeah, I hate myself, too.
Still, Mashiba-kun said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya-san.
That's messed up.
Yeah, I'm not.
Huh? You're asking me?
Yuzu?
All you care about is your sister.
You think?
I will.
Hey, Yuzu
You don't have to.
Because I'm worried about you.
I'm still scared.
Why are you apologizing?
Say, let's hang out tomorrow, too.
Uh, forget slapped. You might get killed.
an8There, there, Mom.
Is it charged?
Shoko!
i1I'm sorry, Nishimiya.
i1Sho-chan.
i1So cold...
You see, Shoko
Uh, I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please...
I'm sowwy...
I heard about what happened with Yasho.
She won't hear me unless I yell!
You gan jange from now,
What's all this?
If only I were gone...
Listen, Nishimiya.
I was talking to you before coming here.
Looks like I was trying to give up on everything.
But that wasn't right.
Are you gonna die?!
I'm not dead, Maria.
I'm a really awful person.
Guess I don't have to.
My daughter's husband. He came back.
Huh?
I can't look at people's faces.
Thanks, Nishimiya.
Nagatsuka-kun?
Huh? That's weird.
Yasho.
You got them?
This is plenty!
You apologized again.
Watch your mouth, Nao.
Her nickname's Sho.
Pages 20 through 25, and the practice problems on page 32.
These will be on the upcoming quiz.
I'll tell you when to start, okay?
I'll copy my notes for you later.
Really? I think it's just right.
How mean.
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.
Ugh, what is this?
That four-eyes really pisses me off.
Before you end up causing any more trouble for your parents...
But Shoya didn't listen.
Right?
They were called aliens, and they had a really hard time.
What were you doing, you creep?!
I don't get it!
I didn't get the log.
Nishimiya!
Goodbye, Mommy.
Why'd you want to kill yourself?
So I was right!
Your phone was off!
Right back at you, you stupid son!
Uh... I'm sorry!
You guys better stay away from that Shoya Ishida.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Shoya Ishida.
Morning.
Ishida.
Wanna go to the courtyard?
Seriously?
i1S-Say...
i1Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.
Figures.
i1But more importantly...
Take your time.
i1Tuesday...
Anybody!
I need a really neat, natural-sounding excuse.
Excuse me for asking,
Friends...
There he is.
Dumped in a paddy field.
I sit behind you, you know.
Wait, Yasho?
She's not here.
Look.
What are you doing here?
That's what best friends do, right?
I dare you to say that again!
Are you peeping at them?
What?
Hey, laddy!
Why?!
Nishimiya!
Huh? What's this?
Not happening, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
I was the one who tweeted that pic of you.
You have a daughter?
Eat up.
Where's Sis?
Damn it...
And I can't let you catch a cold, for Nishimiya's sake.
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
And now you've learned sign language?
What the heck?
Oh.
I have no right to live.
But at the very least, I don't want to make Nishimiya cry any more.
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...
I'm back.
We'll decide that for ourselves,
both Sis and me.keyframe snap worse
You're pretty responsible.
I-I got a cellphone.
Wow, nice.
So?
I think you're really responsible, though.
Sorry, I have no idea.
You'll need to pay for travel, food, and a love hotel.
Sis was pissed off you were leaving her out even though she was the one who asked.
I've kept studying sign language.
Really?
Which high school do you go to?
What's wrong?
Take one.
Ueno?
O-One hour, please.
Long time no see.
The poor thing.
What are you doing, Ueno?
Is it out of guilt or something?
Yuzuru asked me to buy some bread for the carp.
Kinda.
It is very pretty today.
Say, Nagatsuka.
Do these look like the moon to you?
I was just running short on time.
Don't go over my head!
Oh, that would've really annoyed her.
I was a coward, you see.
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
Is your hair natural?
Hey!
Let's go buy some.
Yeah.
i1I hate you.
i1But I'm not about to tell you we should be friends now.
Yeah.
You know, I tried to stop him.
I called her.
Nao badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara!
Yasho...
I shouldn't have come.
Like you're any better.
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
Have some steamed buns.
I got some really nice bread today.
Er...
What's with that outfit?
I saw you crying earlier.
Later.
Even monsters have hearts...
What?
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.
But...
Huh?
Pardon me...
Nishimiya?
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1I should've asked her how she felt about me.
Oh, you can see him now.
Ishida.
I'm sorry.
Please raise your head.
piss me off the most!
Stop it.
I'm so sowwy!
But we're all in the same boat, aren't we?
I see.
You gan jange from now,
Nishimiya...
I'd probably created a convenient image of you in my head.
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
Oh, Maria. You're watering the flowers?
Oh,
Oh, Sho.
Give her the jelly in the fridge.
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?
How've you been?
I'm off.
Who?
I can't look at people's faces.
So I feel much better when I look down.
Are you okay now?
How're you doing?
Nagatsuka...
Yasho.
Oh, and...
What's up?
It's fine. Hand them over.
Huh?
Well, I guess that's just who you are.
Oh, forget it.
I'll go get some fried chicken.
Watch your mouth, Nao-chan.
Ow, that hurts.
Nishimiya.
Start from here.
Next, Ishida.
What?
You're gross!
You can have entire conversations with just hand gestures.
I love him. He's too cool.
Via this book, the author...
Back in the Jomon Period...
Come on, Ishida.
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.
Nishimiya-san!
What? Move.
Ishida...
He might've messed with her from time to time.
Shimada, you did just as much as me!
Right?
I would never do that!
Are you causing trouble for others?
What was that for?
What the heck?
Ishida Shoya.
Wait!
Why I know sign language?
Me and you...
i1Sho-tan!
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?
Good.
He's a bully.
i1and that I had to bear that cross and the punishment that came with it.
i1Doesn't he get lonely, being all alone all the time?
Sorry.
My, thank you.
Come, let's eat.
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
Uh, she's right there.
She's not.
A super creepy one.
There he is.
You see, Ishida-kun...
What's going on?
Stop it.
Hmm?
Who was that turd-head?
This guy.
Not happening, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
Someone's inside!
I'll be going, then.
You should go home soon, too.
Great.
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.
Huh...
She told me go away.
Hold the umbrella over yourself.
I know you made fun...
You made fun of her because she can't hear, right?
Yeah, that's right.
But at the very least, I don't want to make Nishimiya cry any more.
That won't happen.
Sowwy! Sowwy!
I'm sorry, too.
How are you doing?
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.
You're pretty responsible.
You have one too, right?
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
Sahara-san?
You'll need to pay for travel, food, and a love hotel.
Wait, is that right?
I'm really sorry.
Let me check!
Bug!
Oh, you're here?
Long time no see.
What? I'll pass.
Not really.
Id monig.
I-I need to go buy the bread.
See you.
Yeah.
It is very pretty today.
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.
Wow, you changed your hairstyle.
She went home, saying her tummy hurt.Alt: saying she had a stomach-ache. Sounds better but short on time
What did she say?
Of course...
I'm kinda scared.
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
Though I am still terrified.
Here it comes.
Wow.
i1Huh?
Ishida.
I want some takoyaki.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.
I should take Nishimiya-san.
i1I hate you.
i1Back in grade school,
i1You went crying to the adults.
i1and looking back, I even feel like maybe it was inevitable how things turned out.
i1I hade mysel.
i1What the hell is up with that?
What do you think?
Ueno-san, was it?
Huh? Why do you ask?
I can't stand stuff like that.
Yasho?
Yasho!
i1Yeah, I hate myself, too.
Still, Mashiba-kun said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya-san.
What do you think, Sahara?
Enough.
Summer break starts next week.
I've been blessed with truly amazing granddaughters.
What the heck?
What's with that outfit?
Uh, aren't we on summer break right now?
Why are you apologizing?
Okay, Nishimiya?
i1This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.
This is great!
I'm here.
Man, best summer break ever!
I'm really enjoying my time, seriously.
A-Are you really, really sure?
What are you trying to pull?
Nah, I'll pass.
Yeah.
You need to study?
But...
Could you go get my camera for me?
What are you doing?
Nishimiya!
i1From tomorrow,
i1Your sister made pancakes.
i1Yet so warm...
Oh, Yuzuru-chan.
They moved him to a ward room today.
Let go together. Come see him.kametsu: Come with me. Let him see your face. No English person would say this.
Uh, I'm very sorry.
I was too negligent.
You too, Yuzuru-chan.
It's not opening.
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya-san.
Trying to kill yourself 'cause you're having a hard time is messed up!
What's all this?
What is all this?!
Atta girl.
Oh,
Even in this situation, I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya-san.
Guess I don't have to.
Oh, Shimada and Hirose were the ones who pulled you up when you fell.
Sure.
Please tutor me!
Is that how they're used?
So I feel much better when I look down.
Ishida-kun?
Yasho?
So please, Yasho...
N-Nah, it's amazing!
Playing friends, are we?
Huh?
What's your problem, Kawai? You wanna go?
Come on.
I'll go get some fried chicken.
May I?
Let's check out the gym next.
That'll get you around 30,000 yen in total.
What?
Do you have a nickname?
Huh?
Thanks a bunch.
Frens...
would you spend three minutes of homeroom each morning learning sign language?
And it's much easier for me to write.
Mi...
Aren't her clothes lame as hell?
Via this book, the author...
What are you doing, Ishida?
Ishida, you're going too far.
Who cares?
I'm very sorry!
Right. I was wondering that, too.
I'm not!
Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.
Huh?!
You're so mean, Ishida!
Hold on!
Let's go home, Sho.
Huh?
Hey, what are you doing to my desk?
What were you doing, you creep?!
I don't understand that stupid look,
Nishimiya!
i1Sho!
Wake up!
Sho's up!
Thanks for the food.
And what was with that ominous calendar?!
I won't try to kill myself!
i1It was the biggest test of courage in my life.
i1At our middle school entrance ceremony, I overheard Shimada say...
Morning.
i1I bought this on release day.
i1She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.
Sorry about this morning.
But I wouldn't want the money you earned in order to die, anyway.
i1Who, me?
Can't you just take your own bike?
Somebody help!
Huh? For real?
i1but I feel like the universe is telling me not to go.
Why?
This is your bike, right?
Over here, Ishida.
Feel free to tell me.
What are friends, anyway?Borderline keyframe snap. I think it looks better snapped as there's plenty of time to read this short line, but it comes down to personal preference.
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!
Quit being an ass and bring her out!
an8Hey, Nagatsuka...
Nagatsuka!
Wait, you know sign language?
Bread. For the carp.
See you again...
Sorry, but could you go pick up Maria?
Oh, Yuzuru.
You can have them.
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?
Now you know.
Yuzuru, you should stay away from that boy.
From your high school?
Yasho, Yasho.
I'd like to ask you something.
Wait, is that right?
We're giving out discount coupons!
Is she here?
I'm coming in, Sis!
Ueno?
Huh?
Oh.
How have you been?
No way.
Huh? Hang on a sec.
Are you two going out?
Nothing, really.
For me?
Thank you.
...moo.
Why'd you change it?
Did something happen?
Is she avoiding me?
She's acting awfully friendly.
Uh, yeah.
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho has to go through me!
Hey, what're youfscx150
I want some takoyaki.
Huh? H-Hey, wait.
Look, Ueno.
Sh-Shimada?
Wait.
Probably.
Wait, Ueno.
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru.
i1Listen.
i1I hate you.
i1Back in grade school,
i1So I changed my approach.
i1They were signs to stay away from me.
i1But instead of picking up on them, you fired back.
i1Let's shake hands as two people who hate each other.
Huh? What do you mean?
I never badmouthed Nishimiya.
It was so scary.
Oh, Ishida.
Nao?
Still, Mashiba said I should forgive you if you apologized to Nishimiya.
I was only telling the truth!
You're just gonna run and regret your cowardice again, anyway.
Not another word, Kawai.
I'm on your side, okay.
See you.
I shouldn't have come.
Like you're any better.
You're skipping out on the senior citizen meets to learn sign language.
I've been blessed with truly amazing granddaughters.
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?
This bread...
Hey, Yuzufscx150
Ishida.
Heya.
What's with that outfit?
I'll walk you. Where to?
Let me.
Are you sure about this?
What?!
By the way, Yuzuru.
I picked a photo and submitted it to the prefectural photography contest.
i1Please give me one last ounce of strength.
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1From tomorrow,
Ma'am!
Ma'am, he saved my stupid sister.
Please raise your head.
And who the hell are you?!
Kawai, you're being too loud.
We were so worried!
i1Wah!
i1Jeez, cut that out.
Nishimiya.
Come on, don't make that face, Nishimiya...
No!
I'm so sowwy!
Hey, Nishimiya. I...
We've reached your destination, sir.
Guess I don't have to.
Welcome back.
This suits you much better.
Yuzu's upstairs.
Let's do this!
I'm off.
Who?
but I don't fit in at school.
Huh? That's weird.
If you hadn't woken up, it would've been all over for me!
Don't worry about what happened on the bridge!
I beg you!
Nagatsuka...
Nah. You're amazing.
Come on.
They're not talking about anything serious.
Dumb-ass.
Count me in.
It's a girl.
Oh.
Okay, note down the following sections.
Forget about winning the choir competition.
I was distracted for half the class again.
All right.
Next, Ishida.
You need to be smarter about things, or people will start to hate you.
What?
Isn't it amazing?
an8Sign language...
Don't say that, Nao!
How mean.
Shoya's all red!
Later, Shoya.
Stand up already!
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!
What the heck?
I don't get it!
I didn't get the log.
Hello there, Shoko.
Hey.
Sho, wake up!
I'm off.
By the way, Sho...
All the pages were ripped off from April...
What won't you do? Spell it out!
You guys better stay away from that Ishida Shoya.Kametsu: Stay away from a guy named Ishida Shoya.  italics?
i1She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.
i1She said she'd be there every Tuesday.
I'm back.
Sorry.
My, thank you.
Huh? For what?
Uh...
You can take mine.
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?
Look at this! Look at this!
We're best friends.
And that is what friends are.
You see, Ishida...
Here, take the bread, at least.
Hey, look.
Let me see!
Probably using sign language.
What a creep!
Uh...
Not happening, I'm not allowed to go out while I'm suspended.
Waifscx150
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?
Oh, it's the rat.
Oh, that was you?
Nah, I can't.
It's good!
Just take it.
Wait, you two live together?
And now you've learned sign language?
Think you're a better person now?
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.
but I'm Shoko's...
I'm sorry.
I want some of Grandma's perilla juice.
How are you doing?
Nagatsuka, that's not a laddy.
She's Nishimiya's little sister.
I knew that all along.
D-Do you text your friends and stuff?
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?
Sahara, from grade school?
Oh, come on. It's not like that.
Taiyo Girls Academy.
I've kept studying sign language.
Wait, is that right?
We're giving out discount coupons!
Meow Meow Club?
All right.
Shall we go in, Nagatsuka?
Welcofscx150
an8Seriously?
Understood. Thank you very much.
Don't be stupid.
Oh, you're here?
Sorry about grade school.
Oh, Ueno. Get off.
Nothing, really.
Wait, wait. Before that...
Where I'm going?
Nishimiya?
Canfscx150
Doesn't seem like they're candy.
Hello. I'm Mashiba.
Let's line up for that one first, everyone!
Follow me, and don't fall behind!
Sure. Go ahead.
I figured I could decide whether it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.
S-Stop it!
Huh?
Thank you.
Wait.
Yes, we are.
i1Back in grade school,
i1I ignored you and badmouthed you.
i1I'm sowwy.
i1I still hate you,
i1So how about we take it easy from now on?
You badmouthed her yourself.
Yasho?
Yasho!
There you are, Ishida!
Heya.
Got what wrong?
It's all my fault.
You don't have to put it like that.
It doesn't bother me.
And here I thought we were friends.
I'm doing it for myself, so it doesn't count.
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.
What the heck?
How do I look?
Let me.
Because I'm worried about you.
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.
Hey, Nishimiya!
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!
By the way, Yuzuru.
Wait, what?
I couldn't tell from her poker face.
i1I won't run away from things anymore.
i1I'm sorry, Nishimiya.
i1By the way, Nishimiya.
Ishida.
I'm truly sorry.
Please...
Say something.
Are you her mother?!
I'm so sowwy!
I used to think Sis would stop talking about wanting to die if she saw these.
Shall we head someplace else? I'll get you a drink.
You went and saw everyone, huh?
Are you okay?
I'd probably created a convenient image of you in my head.
and forced you into making the worst possible choice.
You fell becas I couldn jange!
But that wasn't right.
I want to apologize to the others, too.
Oh,
I'm a really awful person.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, too.
Who is that?
Looks good.
M-Morning, guys.
Take care.
Shall we?
So I feel much better when I look down.
Ishida?
Oh, and...
What's up?
It's fine. Hand them over.
I actually wanted to make a thousand of these, but I couldn't.
They're not talking about anything serious.
Let's check out the gym next.
Tsundere...
Kudere...
Why am I dressed in this embarrassing outfit?
Liar!
Why are you sexually harassing me even before I start working?
I won't do that. Here, let me help you put this on.
They were not necessary for your healthy life.
She threw us... She threw us away.
I have this costume for a situation like this. You don't have to worry about the curse.
But I got rid of your precious...
Yui... A name only for me...
What? Didn't you say you'd compromise a while ago?
But he looks happy when he's asleep.
Once we get out of the house, I'll be free from being treated like a doll.
Look, I'm a bunny-rabbit.
Heaven calls, boobs call and people call.
Heaven knows, boobs know and people know.
To those who delude with outrageous boobs...
I'm sorry, big sister.
No! It's slimy and it's gonna suck me.
You again? That's not a very nice thing to say.
I'm Minori Sumitomo.
You still have a long way to go, Yui.
What is that supposed to mean?
Speaking of you, you have it your way with an innocent girl like her,
yet you don't spoil her natural charm.
But this costume is cute and I like it.
Anytime.
This is the classic.
Those days when everyone had glorious memories.
It's been a while since I had such a fun time.
Well, I wonder if it's a good idea to emphasize that you're a widow at the first meeting?
As a mother of one, you shouldn't join a suspicious event like this without thinking.
Well, usually only Minori's fans would show up, but today thanks to Yui, it's a full house.
Well, I have no problem.
Wow! So small!
My relatives are moving.
Well, it's okay while he's asleep quietly.
I'm sure there's something in Ms. Sumitomo's bag.
Mr. Murase!
Michael, lock on to the target.
Mr. Murase! At this time, I truly respect you.
How's this?
Until Miss Sumitomo comes back, I'll take care of you like I'm your mom.
I can't take my eyes off you.
I love babies. I'm by your side
Huh? Welcome home, Mr. Murase.
Yeah, I'm back.
Don't call him "that". I'm babysitting him.
The Older-sister type.
What's wrong?
Then, we'll set her up and send her to you.
That would be part of the good service from the store manager.
You're saying this is selfish?
Hey you!
We won't forgive her.
Oh, no! What should I do?
In such a situation, you'll need this costume.
Even so, I only want you!
Me too. I'd like to serve you.
I'm sorry for throwing away all your dolls.
Every doll has a different name.
Then this is what you get!
...shall give punishment!
Yeah.
But, you're cute too.
Alright, let's go eat something before looking for your lost Mom.
I'm back, Dad.
So that is your uniform, isn't it?
Don't force your daughter to wear such a costume, please!
while satisfying your requirements for costumes. I find it admirable.
Anytime.
Mom!
Hey, where have you been, Mom?
As a mother of one, you shouldn't take part in suspicious parties like these!
Why don't we help them?
Really? Oh, thank you!
There's no reason to...
I hope there's no hidden meaning in that reaction.
I'd like to go walking and shopping together with him.
Then, why don't you try to have a baby with him, Sumitomo-san?
Dad?
Oh, what should I do?
He told me to come to the caf immediately...
Well, I can look after him for you if you'd like.
Eh, is it okay with you?
I'll be back soon.
My breasts don't produce milk.
i1Maybe I should call Sumitomo-san?
I forgot how much fun shopping was.
Let's download!
i1Error detected.
My bad.
Don't throw me away, Murase-san!
I'm gonna look after you like I'm your Mom until Sumitomo-san comes back.
What are you wearing?!
Okay.
But... How did Sumitomo-san know that she's a maid robot?
Even though I understand... It's hard to believe reality is like that.
Yes, nice to meet you too!
Um... I told you...
This is my perverted master, Murase-san.
You have a great friend.
G... Good evening.
Excuse me.
You get the feeling of a rich girl's room when you look at it...
But, those days are going to end soon.
The Maid Robot Contest will now begin!
Answer your Master's expectations.
This can be used to wipe stuff, absorb dust, it also can absorb water.
Next, it's the final stage.
It'll be alright if you do what you like.
Kuon-san, congratulations for winning!
Congratulations on winning, Kuon.
Yui-san, tea.
What's wrong, Takaya-kun.
Yui seems to have received a great shock.
Hey... why are you suddenly depressed again?
Look, everyone's here!
Mom, don't stick so close to Takaya!
Oh, ok.
Do you know how to swim?
But Yui, the strain it puts on your body...
Ah! Water! Water!
Seriously, don't do such things.
Who would've guessed that I'd be having contact with Murase-san so naturally.
Eh? It's alright, so don't worry.
I'm sorry, Kanae onee-san!
Yui-chan only knows how to like something that has shape.
I'll get you!
Is Minori alright?
I said something I shouldn't have.
I'll feel bad.
It made me feel weird.
That has its problems too!
It's a promise.
Takaya-kun seems interested in the MP new product announcement fair.
Oh... so that's it.
Welcome...
But Takaya is more amazing.
Wow... It's so well made.
Wearing such lustful clothes...
Now do you believe it?
C-Certainly...
S-Sakuya-san doesn't dislike that?
B... But Murase-san is an otaku!
He doesn't have a job.
He's a good-for-nothing person.
You still haven't slept yet, Yui?
Uh... That...
Are you together with Sakuya-san?
I see.
Yui's heart and body were naturally made that way.
Oh yeah, you didn't do it yesterday.
Since you're already tardy, shouldn't you see it fit to watch that attitude?
If my attitude is A... What is yours? F? G?
Right, Kuon-chan?
Sensei, Yui-chan is not feeling well.
The noodle bread is sold out.
What? Do you want this?
Are you jealous?
Dad, what are you doing?
That's not it... we were just messing around...
Thank you! I got saved by you again.
I would have left him for a different master.
No matter what, as a maid robot, we have to serve our masters.
What's with it today... It must be a hard day.
I can tell from the tired and exhausted Murase-san, you both are really love-love.
Did he change?
Hey, isn't Takaya here?
Then, we shall confirm it.
But...
That is...
Takaya!
But... Murase-san...
You're wrong, Ayumi.
After Yui-san and Takaya-san came, the customers...
I sometimes feel what Ayumi-chan is feeling.
Even the shop is like this...
Sure, I don't mind.
I'm only lending it! She has to give it back later!
Uh... That... Not really...
Serving the master wholeheartedly is the duty of a maid robot.
Yeah, Kuon is right.
About that, I think I should clarify something.
Everyone is waiting for Yui.
I can't say it... I've already woken up.
But...
If it's like this...
Oh, you're still here.
That sort of thing... That sort of thing...
I can't leave Murase-san, no matter what.
I only need Yui.
Murase-san... that's...
Why are you wearing clothes that makes you look like you're going to have a duel?
It was just discussing about the new maid robot's abilities and looks.
Then my troubles... what...
Yeah, it'll probably be like that from now on.
There's nothing keeping us from making more good memories.
Eh... yeah...
Huh?
You do not need to speak.
Ah, her name is Kuon. She's a maid robot like me from Maid Works.
I will only be a display for eternity.
What is it?
The air is twisted!
Argh... Who cares!
O month X dayToday is my first day on show, I wonder what will my master be like...
Reply to your Master's anticipations.
Do your best, Luchima.
She is herself, Yui is Yui.
As long as I try a little, winning will be expected.
From now on, I'll try even harder.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I cannot let her go because she's so well made.
To regain her confidence, I've tried various ways.
B...Between the legs, it's on fire!
Murase-san!
Oh... P... Please don't let go!
Eh?
If so, I cannot play with Sumitomo-san anymore!
We'll remember you!
Are you happy today?
I think forcing you to come has paid off.
I'm sorry, Kanae onee-san!
Is it because Murase-san always washes it for me, so that I cannot do it by myself?
How can a girl be like that?
Is Minori alright?
I've had a great day with Yui today.
Master... Why are you apologizing... to a maid robot?
I can finally meet you! Takaya!
I've come back as a maid robot from MP!
Wow... It's such well made.
You must've injected all your thoughts and feelings into her.
See you later!
But, bringing me home so suddenly...
You're so ecchi.
Are you really a figurine that was created by Murase-san?
Oh yeah, on the day that Yui came...
Seriously, something like a curse is unscientific.
Uh... You can call it a teenagers need.
But... the things you've done to Sakuya-san, you still want to do it?
I'm very thankful to Takaya.
I know it all.
S... Secret activities...
Sakuya...
I should hibernate the hardware in my brain.
Yeah, Sakuya's sleeping soundlessly now.
I'm afraid to tell you...
The Takaya who suddenly awakens his powers.
Eh? No...
You know, I can't decide unless I see them moving.
I'm afraid we can't let you 'test drive' them like a car, because you might damage them.
If you're after a romantic relationship type, you might prefer a different one.
This is... uh, how I'm programmed.
You must have done it on purpose!
All I need is an apron.
Don't be silly.
That can't be true! Where did you put them?
I just disposed of all the useless stuff to create a pleasant work environment.
That's why you look so happy, huh?
This is the reason why I bought you.
But he treats me like a doll.
So, is there any chance you could come backto my place?
What's past is past. Don't worry about it.
C'mon, that's not fun!
I'm happy to be going out together with Murase-san!
I can wash my body by myself!
What should I do?
The rabbit is really cute.
...shall give punishment!
It's all the boob girl's fault.
I command thee to come forth; Takochu-kun of another world!
Oh no! These slimy tentacles are wrapping around me.
No! Just Mom is lost...
Welcome home.
Oh, you have company?
I could tell just by looking at Sumitomo-san that she's a perfect example of a man's dreams.
So shall we have a party?
Anytime.
You met your Mom at last. Good for you!
Thank you for taking care of my daughter.
My name is Kanae Hagiwara.
Well, usually the only people who come to our cafe are Minori's fans.
You two have been a great help.
Thank you very much.
If you work here, I will too!
Wow, so small!
Yeah. He's really cute, right?
Ah, nice....
I'm surrounded by Murase-san's collection of inanimate objects everyday.
So, the feeling of touching a living creature is just irresistible!
Thought so. There's no way he's your baby.
'Cause I was born as a woman.
I have no idea what to do! I can't leave the baby alone.
Thank you! It's a great help!
What have I done?!
Michael, lock on to the target.
Oh, so small.
How's this?
I'm almost done here.
Don't do that either.
I was asked to take care of the baby.
I was made there also.
Nice to meet you too.
She's a maid robot from Maid Works like me.
And this is Mr. Murase.
I'll be a display forever.
You have a lovely friend.
Me ga sametara anata ga nikkori
Apron sashidasu anata ni gakuzen
Shiawase wo agetai na
Hey, Yui, I'm not used to seeing you. What's going on?
Okay!
Imagine this...
You can do it, Yui! Mr. Murase!
I forgot to set the protection coating for allyl sulfide.
Please don't throw it away.
Next, it's the final stage.
Excuse me for going before you.
But I'll do my best.
My suggestion wasn't bad, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Can someone like me come to a sunny place like this?
If you're not busy, can you please put some sunscreen on me?
Hey, Takaya.
Thank you so much.
Get away!
Hey, let's go.
She's working at the seaside club house.
I have to make money to pay my travel fee.
I'll help too.
It's here, I won't lose
Don't look at me, I'm embarrassed
Jiggly jiggly jiggly
What do you mean by that?
You can't judge by yourself what's fun for me.
Thanks!
That means I'm still young.
You must be someone who can leave a lot.
It's painful.
Let's come back together again.
Welcome...
The lines of the detailed parts captures everyone's attention. Well done job.
The finger touching all over the body...
You want to look at the enlarged version of me, right?
And then, the figure with the reflection of Takaya's affection was born.
Hey, that may cause misunderstanding.
I'm very thankful to him.
I've seen it all.
You're still up, Yui.
Don't you want to customize me like Sakuya?
Maybe a normal man can't control himself,
Takaya who's suddenly awakened to his instinct for battling...
Look, your hair antennae are messed up.
Thank you very much.
She's so beautiful.
No cosplay-like frills, please!
I am the maid and you are the master
Right? Right?
I want to make you happy
The romance hiding behind the apron
Is for your eyes only, take a glance!
If you see me undressed, they're decent.
Well, I...
Don't wet your pants.
Good day, big sister.
We've been caught.
Is this typical?
It's wet and disgusting.
I'm going to get mad.
Hey, what are you doing?
Here, doctor, take off her clothes.
Dad, what are you doing?
Wait for me, Minori.
It's not that, I was just fooling around.
How long have you been there?!
Peeping is awful!
Well... But lately...
You don't even care about the situation. I can no't work even though I want to.
I've been here, Mr. Murase.
You get a special type of affection that normal maids don't get.
No, Kuon, that can't happen with Mr. Murase.
This is from MP.
But...
I thought I heard someone called me.
We have lots of baggage, so let's go to my house already.
No matter who the master goes out with,
It's the duty of maid robots, but...
Come on, more importantly, why isn't Takaya here?
Hot coffee to Takaya from me.
She's Tsundere.
Do you have something else on your mind?
It may be too late to ask, but why did Yui pass out?
Every relationship between a master and a maid is different.
But even if Yui feels that way, what about Mr. Murase?
Actually, he's going out with another woman.
Store manager?
but everyone is so serious, so I have no guts to wake up.
Where are you going?
Don't you need me?
Who is this woman, anyway?
Yui?
Thank god, Yui!
Everyone!
Suki desu I love you
I'm gonna be late!
Thank you very much!
Yes, I'm alright!
Hey, Yui-san.
I'll get expelled if they find out I'm a robot!
OK!
What are you talking about? I...
Were you masturbating?
Ah, we've been caught... It's sticky...
Yui-san, why are you so wet?
No.
Sakuya-kun.
Wait for me, Minori.
What's so good about it?
These types of imaginations... They're only allowed in games!
Were you behaving well? Yui.
Please excuse me, Murase-san.
Ah, Murase-san, you're very sweet.
I don't get it.
Womens?
Takaya-kun is not here today.
My... important... memories.
About that... there isn't any problems.
It's the same today.
He hopes she can see him when she opens her eyes.
I sometimes feel what Ayumi-chan is feeling.
But I... Because I'm good friends with Yui-chan...
W... Wait!
It's not good if you don't eat properly.
But she has kept the clothes that Takaya made.
Even though it's late, but why did Yui-san faint suddenly?
But...
Yui?
How can I sleep peacefully?
Yui... you...
If it's like that... Then I'm like an idiot!
Eh?
A normal maid robot like me... Can't I be with you?
Uh... Uh...
Yui-san, I'm sorry.
It's shining!
Hello, everyone's here.
Eh? Yui-chan?!
W... Wait... Everyone?
There's nothing that will leave nothing.
Peach blossoms, eh?
How about you guys just come out?
Huh? What's that? yep, not "who" -guuIf you don't want the Huh? in the subtitles, then retime this line to exclude the sound
You don't know?
If you want to repent in hell for the evil deeds you've done till now...
Today was a big success too!was: It's a big success today as well.
As expected from our boss.
But compared to sleeping outside like I usually have to, this is heaven.
Hand over all your valuables!
And then...
Even though your opponent is just a kid, she's a rowdy girl who's hard to deal with.
This time, he just won't take it anymore.
Honorablewas: Mr., -dono is rather more polite Village Chief, excuse me for interrupting your conversation.
From what I've heard, Lin Lin is a rowdy girl, and even the adults find it difficult to deal with her.
Nah, I didn't call myself that.
Hey!
Let's go back, let's go back.
Geez. Compared to them, I might actually be old.
It's none of your business!
Chouhi, I heard that your parents were killed when you were a child.
S-So what?!
I decided never to let something like that happen again.
Hey!
I just want you to apologize to the village chief and the villagers, and to change your behavior.
Will you do that?
How is the water temperature?
Hey! Don't jump in!
What? What's the matter?
What should I do to get that plump?
Oh, yeah. It's ambition.
If that's the case, I'll have ambition in my heart too!
TLC - is this something, or just a meaningless exclamation? - guu says just an exclamation
Sorry that I'm borrowing your bed as well.
It's okay. Because I lost the fight, sleeping together for one night can't be helped. it can't be helped to sleep together for one night. 
H-Hey, I haven't accepted yet.
There, take a look.
People with various desires in their hearts are entangled by the colored threads of fate, and are connected together.
It's already spring.
Listen, Chouhi.
Since you've become my younger sister, you have to listen to what I say.
I'll walk slowly.
Right there!
Huh, right there?
Yeah!
What is it?
Chouun-dono is staying with me as a guest general.
My name is Kan'u. My courtesy name is Unchou.
Y-You have the wrong idea! Lin Lin isn't my daughter.
H-Hey! Don't give a definitive answer if you don't really know what it means!
So, what does it mean?
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
That's why she won't lose to someone like you!
I know.
Oh? So what's the plan?
In other words, our stratagem is to let the robbers themselves guide us to their hideout.
B-But, going into the robbers' hideout alone is...
In order to extinguish the cunning robbers, some risks are inevitable.
Why?
Ch-Chouun-dono.
Shh, the robbers might come at any time.
That's why you guys couldn't find them, no matter how hard you looked.
Or is this going to get smaller?
I'm going to punish you.
Are you all right?
Sorry.
Yes. Because Kan'u-dono hasn't returned yet, she said she's worried, and she went to the robbers' hideout too.
She said she'd manage to find it somehow, so she asked me to tell her where Shakudouzan is.
Yes. And then she rushed out like the wind.
But what are you doing over there?
It's okay.
What's the matter?
We weren't planning to be officers yet.
Well, that was unfortunate.
Losing her parents to bandits...
Okay!
Don't take them lightly!
Only at times like these...
What will happen if she's caught?
How cruel.
Would you allow me to handle this task?
But are you really strong?
Well, this is...
You are...?
It seems that rumors can't always be trusted.
Umm... I wonder what you mean by that...
Hey. stop that!
Old lady!
Who are you calling old?!
Let's bury her.
All right, all right.
I won't do anything bad to Rinrin, so you guys head back to the village.
Oh, just some punishment.
Brute force isn't working.
Huh? What is?
Don't you want to change it?
I don't understand that!
But, but I didn't know what to do and... and...
I've been traveling for a long time. I'm used to something like that.
Charge!
Your breasts are big.
How?
Okay.
And it's been so long since I slept with someone like this and...
It's not bad at all.
And it's like being together with mommy...
I didn't say no...
Now, now I won't be lonely during the night.
That's why everyone...
Boss!
Don't cry. Tears before a journey is a bad omen.
and the following sponsors you see on screen.
who strike her in the mountains around here.
You villains who harass innocent people by taking advantage of unstable times...
With prices for everything going up...
Letting bandits come this close to a village...
Bandits?!
Anyway, what are her parents doing?
Today was a great success!
Rinrin Bandits are the best!
Okay!
Escape and become bandits!
Can I also ask you to clean up the barn?
Understand? Even if they're kids, they're violent beyond our control.
Officers for that?
This time he finally snapped.
I doubt they would kill her, but...
I'm a traveling martial artist named Kannu.
It seems that rumors can't always be trusted.
It'd be dangerous if it hit me!
Who are you calling old?!
Now, give up already.
How stupid!
She did!
Someone like you will get beaten by Boss!
To not let something like that happen again!
Even if you say so...
I've been traveling for a long time. I'm used to something like that.
...Maybe.
All right, I'm going to have a strong will in my heart as well!
Sister?
So I can't?
Yay! I have an older sister now!
Well in reality, it's actually a trip to see how we can change this world.
It's just that the bandit members didn't come to see me off.
I'm not crying!
In such times, there were people who secretly stocked power out of ambition.
It's spring already!
Kannu-san is going to die!
Pony Canyon,
Well, there seems to be people who call me that though...
That's good to hear.
Aisha, you're famous for being beautiful!
Kannu-dono,
What does that mean then?
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
By that, you mean?
I too, have heard rumors of the Black-haired bandit hunter while traveling.
Well, that's true...
H-Hey, Rinrin!
Aisha is realllly strong.
Not yet!
I can still go!
would you visit the bandit's hideout with me?
You probably can't stay still for a moment's time.
It's simple. I just have to stay still like this!
Don't give up!
Ch-Chouun-dono,
Is there anything wrong with my knees?
and the goods went into the hands of bandits as planned.
It probably was a mine here.
Please stop it.
Come face me if you don't value your lives!
W-What? Does she have company?
How unlucky of me.
An exit!
Rinrin!?
Everyone don't panic. Stay calm.
Sei. call me Sei
Well then, let's go, Aisha.
Understood!
T-Then, where do I get to show off?
She's not one with the caliber to rule these troubled times,
Aren't you saying quite harsh things there?
Pony Canyon
I want to call you by your true name but you didn't tell me...
Oh really...
It's fine.
I'm ruling this area as an Imperial Adviser.high ranking goverment officer
I'm having her stay here as a visiting general. alteratively sub-general
Hey, don't use your true name, make a proper introduction and greeting.
Then which one's the seme and which one's the uke?attacker and reciever if you need to TL those... read enough yaoi and you'd understand
T-That's...
Enshou of Kishuu,
Kousonsan-dono,
I see.
Oh, would that be okay?
Oh, about Shakudouzan.
Hearing that, I made up a plan the other day.
It's impossible for you.
Why is that?
While hiding in the goods and heading for their hideout, you will have to keep silent.
That's easy!
It's simple. I just have to stay still like this!
Don't give up!
Leave it over here.
Underground?
This would be enough for you guys!
Thank you for saving me.
I see. So that's how you got caught.
But, to go into the hideout, the plan was conducted because we don't know where the hideout is...
This way!
Rinrin!?
Why?
Sei. call me Sei
Since we're going to hell together,
T-Then, where do I get to show off?
Unfortunately...
But... was it all right?
But that's all.
She's not one with the caliber to rule these troubled times,
it seems more fun being with you guys.
Next episode
5pb and
This program was brought to you by:
Reiha-sama, Sousou has come asking to see you.
Even if it is true, there are things you are allowed to say and things...
I can't beat that.
I was so embarrassed because of you two!
H-hey, what are you sayin-
My name is Sousou. We shall meet again if there is a chance.
It can't be helped since we're short on money for lodging for the night.
I asked for a large serving, isn't this a bit small?
Prize money and a great supplementary prize for the champion
Why is that?
Because I'm going to be the champion.
So everyone, now that we've had a very pleasing speech from Enshou-sama, let's begin the first match!
She stops it!
You brat!
Wow. No match for Bachou!
The small giant, Chouhi is now this close to the championship!
Is a new legend being born now?
This match is a draw.
Now for the closing speech, I, the prestigious, shall-
Eat well.
So,
If we lose...?
No, I mean I'll give you the axe. That means you are laid off.
We'll first begin with the cleverness exam.
It's not something you'd be bad at or anything...
See?
However, you're not battling each other using weapons but...
So it's getting exciting...
I'm back!
Bachou is,
5pb
the following sponsors you see on screen.
I'll go as soon as I get dressed.
Ha! You're admitting defeat!
It must be beautiful below as well. below can be interpreted as 'pubic hair' or 'face' or 'body'
Umm... uh well... no... umm...
Sei, aren't you doing it a bit too well?
Welcome back, my master.
How could you lay your hands upon something that's going to be served to customers while carrying it!
The prestigious En family has always...
That's not enough to beat Rinrin!
But the strongest is...
That's it, you two.
So, my next workplace is at...
Have as much as you want.
Hmm well...
In simple terms, like a guest I guess.
For just a while, it won't hurt I guess.
Since I haven't been in battle for so long, I might be lacking exercise.
Compete, you say?
It looks like they're ready!
Roar Roar Roar
Will the Bunshuu-Ganryou team be able to surpass this?
87 to 13, it's a clear victory for the Chouhi-Bachou team.
We await the Chouhi-Bachou team.
What are you doing on the public broadcast!
Next week on Koihime Musou, Episode 4,
This program was brought to you by:
I didn't wet my bed this mornin-
That I was hiding something?
Then...
I was kicked off while sleeping.
Keifa, continue.
Yes... the enemy's main forces have mostly been exterminated.
What is that?
With someone impatient like you, even things that would've been settled won't be.
No way.
why don't we make a deal?
Sousou-dono, what was that assassin...
Anything if I can answer it.
from what I've heard, you seem to do well with swords as well.
Uh... oh...
and she may not have wanted to inform a child who takes pride in her father's bravery, of the way he died.
Respecting the feelings of Batou-dono, who was a warrior, she accepted the ill fame herself, which was a praiseworthy act.
So you're saying I am telling lies?
Bachou, stand up and take your weapon.
I am a warrior as well. I cannot be called a liar and just leave!
Shut up!
Bye bye!
You seem really happy saying goodbye to your friend.
No worries.
Daddy, I will practice a lot so...
No, since you seem to be a virgin, I should keep silent about what I did.
But getting it after all that is...
Nothing in particular.
Our army overwhelmed them.
You seem to have sweat a lot.
K-Karin-sama...
What are you smiling about?
I worked hard as well!
What? Sousou!?
I see. So that woman is called Aisha.
I will have my revenge for my father!
Let go!
Welcome back, my maste-
These guys are evil! When Bachou suddenly tried to kill them, they got mad and captured her!
Kannu...
Sousou-dono.
Sousou-dono, can you somehow spare her life?
Right.
There are many in the capital who consider me a nuisance.
Those intruders ruined the fun.
Kannu, I thank you for saving me from the hands of the assassin.
So look forward to that time.
Sousou?
From what I see, you seem to be quite intoxicated.
You shouldn't push it.
Maybe it was to forget his embarrassment in front of the guests, but he drank great amounts of alcohol
He was already close to death.
Though someone may have been watching from somewhere.
My master, umm... has something that makes her tend to be misunderstood.
Can you talk to yourself again in front of Bachou?
But because of that, for you to always have a grudge against Sousou-dono and try to take her life, it wouldn't be good for you I thought-.
I can imagine you were coaxed by Sousou.
She has no unguarded moment.
And I can feel her spirit like clear water...
Don't have to worry if there is a river.
AND WHY IS THAT!?
No, as I thought, you are more fun than Kousonsan-dono.
Chouun.
Yeah, that's it.
What's the cause of such a dull face?
"Tonight, offer food at the temple in the outskirts of the village
otherwise, disaster will rain upon the village"
But, Tonton-dono, why would you do something like that?
Was it that scary of a monster?
Though nobody saw the exact figure,
What will happen to this village now...
Oh, is it?
What... it was something like that.
Good luck slaying the monster.
W-What is this heavy strike!
So you were scared before you knew it.
What is she?
Same for me, but with large serving for the fried rice.
Dandan Noodles for me.
They all were deserted or were injured.
No need to worry about that.
Given name, Bunwa.
So we'll have them properly trained and help guard the city.
When you walk in a mountain you're supposed to sing to avoid bears.
No, as I thought, you are more fun than Kousonsan-dono.
It's not like we tricked you.
That's wrong.
We'll make you feel good, so good that you'll feel like you're rising to heaven.
This person is, although not the most beautiful and noticeable,
Is it all right?
Rather, that doesn't make any sense!
Oh, it's Kaku.
So it's the usual thing again.
In addition, prices are inflating and people are becoming upset.
suddenly a huge boulder was placed in front of the gate.
We got scolded in return, saying "Don't trouble the Lord saying a monster appeared."
That's right.
That's great. You're going to accept it!
Well, that might be true but...
Leave it to us!
Wake up...
Yes...
Oh no!
Dandan Noodles for me.
Double cooked pork for me, also white rice and egg soup.
That's absolutely no good.
How worried do you think I was until I got informed!
Oh, really...
It's not with evil intentions at all.
Right, Ryofu-san?
By the way, Ei-chan,
You mean all those dogs?
Umm, that's...
I'm dumbfounded.
We're leaving the bandits completely to Sousou just because she's here.
It disgusts me that a fool of a feudal lord would act so arrogantly.
P-Pardon us.
Oh? Then by all means, I'd like to take a look at it.
I-I'm sorry. We'll change it for you right away!
What are you thinking, dipping your fingers into the customer's food while you're carrying it?
O-O-O-Ouch...
Lin Lin, we don't need you here anymore.
The governor-general of Kishuu, head of the super-noble En family, Enshou-sama!
Please fully enjoy the matches between the heroes who have gathered here today from across the country.
while we listen appreciatively to Enshou-sama's speech, let's begin the first match!
She came from far-western Seiryou to participate today.
First, the amazing small whirlwind, Chouhi!
The match that will decide the strongest one in this tournament is finally here.
Ah, yeah.
I wonder if those two are a good fit to be Enshou's army generals, who must be strong, intelligent, and beautiful.
A match, you say?
Look.
Oh!
There are lots of interesting clothes.
We lost.
It's even a little too much for me.
Yeah, we won.
Eh, umm, hi. My name is Bachou.
Next episode, Koihime Musou, Fourth Feast:
Don't sing such weird songs too loudly. It's embarrassing.
Hey...
Oh no, nothing like that...
Where are you?
What's the cause of such a dull face?
Secretly observing the lives of the locals in disguise.
After that, about once every seven days they get a letter-arrow shot in demanding more, is what I've heard.
Yes...
That's right.
What is it this time?
When we had tuan zi in the tea shop yesterday, didn't you eat one stick more than me?dango in chinese lol
Come to think of it, it was a moonless night like this...
Though I was walking to go over the mountain before the sun set,
At first I thought it was the sound of mice in the attic but...
Hey Ai Sha,
This guy is strong!
Yes...
Lu Bu Fengxian.
You guys are good guys.
I tried to make money before but...
Eh?
Friends.
I'm sorry.
I see. It was like that...
It's not with evil intentions at all.
Understood.
That's good.
I got it... we will.
and light it...
I will keep silent for 30 seconds.
Yes, yes, if it meets me suddenly in a place like this...
How cruel. You tricked me.
Hey...
I won't let bullies go!
Unfortunately, we don't offer guides to heaven but,
Secretly observing the lives of the locals in disguise.
In addition, prices are inflating and people are becoming upset.
A man-eating bear or whatever appeared in the mountains!In the mountains a man-eating bear appeared or whatever!
In the letter tied onto it:
otherwise, disaster will rain upon the village"
But, Tung Tung-dono, why would you do something like that?
So, landlord, it's true that a monster appeared.
That's right.
I have my reasons too...
Umm... well...
Of course I'm not!
Oh, I might've overdone it.
Damn, how dare it deceive us.
True, it was no monster.
What is she?
That her strength is comparable to that of a monster.
Umm...
Four ramen.
This is really...
It is a praiseworthy act to hear voices of the people directly but,
But it was all to save the injured and deserted dogs.- uhh weren't dogs food? XD
Okay, I understand.
Hey Yue, "love me very much?"
I mean it!
She must be showing feelings of gratitude.
Rather, don't cling to me!
First, I stab a wick into my bellybutton...
Hey, General Hua Xiong, why are you doing the preview without permission!
Then I'm going to eat it!
I'll give you my menma next time.
All right, so let's go that way.
Menma...
It's getting foggy.
This is bad. We won't notice if we go off track.
Rinrin, wait! Don't go off on your own!
Where are you?
Don't be so polite.
Hawawawawawa big trouble, master!
I'm sorry to trouble you.
Suikyou-dono, I am thankful for your treatment but you don't have to do this much...
Oh, Koumei-dono can even cook?
I hope it suits your taste.
Oh, then what can you make?
I hope nothing happened to Sei though...
Kannu-san, I shall wipe your body.
Oh, could it be the big one?
And she also helps properly too.
Oh, you are not?
In the first place, I haven't had the chance to do anything that would make me pregnant-
I want to become someone who helps everyone, like my master.
Oh sorry, I saw Suikyou-dono doing that so I unconsciously...
intermission
But I have to deliver the medicine I was asked for, to the village below.
Okay.
...is not how it should go.
What a clumsy girl she is, stumbling upon nothing.
What is she hesitating for?
When master was here, she held my hand and we crossed it together.
But this is for Kannu-san, I have to bear it.
Heh, I'm sure she will become scared halfway and give up.
Even though she's afraid of heights, why does she do it so desperately?
Just a bit, a little bit further...
I only helped out, so you give it to Aisha.
You were so hesitant I had no choice!
Well done.
The Salonpa-grass seemed to have worked well.
Even if she is that mature, having her travel alone at that age is...
So if it is all right, I would like you to add her to your traveling partners.
It will become quite lonely here if she leaves.
I want to grant her feelings.
Graduation meaning...?
I'm sorry. Like this showing an apology gesture
Whatever we do, the menma from that time will never come back.
It's a crossroad. I wonder which path we should take.
Rinrin, watch where you're going.
Oh no, what should we do?
We're saved. Let's ask them to let us rest for a while there.
This should do the job.
Yes, master.
Oh, it's nothing.
I see... But then I can't even go to the bathroom.
Understood!
A friend coming from far away, is also happy.
But I have to deliver the medicine I was asked for, to the village below.
Right.
But...
I'll pick it and bring it back after she gives up and leaves.
Even though she's afraid of heights, why does she do it so desperately?
Chouhi-san?
Why did you come here?
Well done.
together with Rinrin-chan.
Oh, the swelling has gone away completely.
Yes. That girl had been saying before that she wanted to go on a journey to see around the world.
It will become quite lonely here if she leaves.
I apologize for eating the menma while you went to the bathroom.
I'm sorry. Like this showing an apology gesture
Ah, it was delicious.
Menma...
Ling Ling, wait! Don't go off on your own!
Oh no, it seems like we've lost Xing.
Let's go look for her!
Hawawawawawa big trouble, master!
This should do the job.
Your stray partner might be found in the meantime.
I see... But then I can't even go to the bathroom.
W-Why? Why does everyone laugh?
But before that...
I leave it to you.
Oh, if it's so,
Not being concerned about how well you are praisedacceptedaknowledged, recoginized, mustn't that be how a great person shall be.
She's outgoing and bright.
She lost her parents when she was young.
While she was being thrown around her relatives with her sisters, they were separated.
I want to become someone who helps everyone, like my master.
I like being petted. - sound wrong XD but maybe true... XD
It's been three days since applying the poultice but the swelling hasn't healed much yet.
Oh, but they only grow quite high up in the mountain.
Okay.
I shall follow her like this,
Could you have been following...
You did it!
together with Ling Ling-chan.
When I was young, I also went on journeys to many places for experience and gained many things.
Oh, that is right...
Understood. I, Guan Yu, will responsibly take Zhuge Kong Ming-dono.
Congratulations on graduating from the program, Zhao Yun-san!
Graduation meaning...?
I will succeed Zhao Yun-san and do my best.
Well then, Xing, your last big job please.
Then you are mad.
Thanks for the meal!Gochisou-sama!thanks for the great meal
Xing, Xing are you there?
Oh no, it seems like we've lost Xing.
Let's go look for her!
I'm all-
In any case, there's nothing we can do in this fog.
Huh?
Hey, don't move around!
This should do the job.
and...
What are you saying? You can consider it lucky that your bone wasn't broken.
Oh, you don't have to do it since we have this.
If you feel like it, please don't hesitate to ask.
I can cook too!
Understood!
A friend coming from far away, is also happy.
I understand, so calm down.
Oh sorry, I saw Shui Jing-dono doing that so I unconsciously...
Oh, that's all right.
I see, well it would be best if I could go with you.
Okay.
A friend coming from far away...
When we get to where the herbs grow, I'll pick them as well and bring them back before she does!
That aside, we have to pick the Salonpa-grass.
together with Ling Ling-chan.
It must be a bother to you but, I want you to take Zhu Li on your journey with you.
Kong Ming-dono on a journey?
Yes. That girl had been saying before that she wanted to go on a journey to see around the world.
When I was young, I also went on journeys to many places for experience and gained many things.
Understood. I, Guan Yu, will responsibly take Zhuge Kong Ming-dono.
Hey Rinrin, don't get too far ahead alone.
You have nothing to do with this so shut up!
And I will!nico comment: Rinrin DIE!
Those idiots!
Even though she should have eaten more than anyone in the previous matches, she still had such power left?
By the way, what happened to Kannu and Chouun?
dont know if you want to sub this??
Rinrin is Chouhi with given name Yokutoku.
Oh, you don't have to worry about the money.
Travelling Eating Practitioners. nico: A party of people with low intelligence levels
Who? It's you, you and...
How disastrous.
Come the day after tomorrow!
What were you thinking?
No, it's nothing.
Oh my.
Sis, this person is great.
She's never been in this mountain but she finds mushrooms and edible plants one after another.
"What's the meaning of" what?
I don't know if you are Kachou or Gacho-n but come down! Gacho-n is a really old gag
??? no clue-campa
Wrongdoings by partners shall be punished by partners.
Geez.
All's well.
gone...
She really didn't notice it...
I see. Then we will be separating here on.
Aisha! Aisha!
I mean, why did you come looking for me?
Yes.
Hey, don't be drinking, do the preview!
You have nothing to do with this so shut up!
I'm hungry...
I did what I needed to and departed again for training but...
You're from before...
Well, it's not like that...
Whether you are an eating practitioner or an ant-eater, you're going to get hurt if you get involved.
Runt...
They are so sneaky.
Welcome back.
Who are they?
It'd be meaningless if we charge them.
Oh, it's nothing.
What were you thinking?
If we walk through the night, we might catch up with Rinrin-chan somewhere.
Well, I wouldn't feel good eating without doing anything. nico: Look, you find a bra in the back
Is it really like that...?
Thanks for all you've done yesterday.
Oops, we're not the ones fighting today.
Master, please.
Y-Yes...
I don't have anything against youhave no grudge against you, but this is my job. You will be enjoying some pain.
So, drop your weapons... this bleeds but if it dosest its quick.. snap it back to the frame if you want.. or make it fade.. id do it but lazy...sorry 3erd thing iv timed to day... and this show sucks..-campa
I don't know a weirdo like that.
??? no clue-campa
GOT IT!?
Goodbye.
Since I think there would be an even larger eating competition there.
Chouhi, scratch that.
Look
Get this Rinrin? I am the older sister and you are the younger sister.
I see.
The first glass after the main episode ends is the best!
Let me see...
Hawawawawawa no idea what to do with this note..pointless to even be there-campa
So I think we can go as Ling Ling-chan says.
This is an issue between me and Ai Sha!
And I will!nico comment: Ling Ling DIE!
Come, Kong Ming-dono, we shall go too.
It's a city!
Just as I thought, my fortune telling was correct!
Eating Competition held today. De Javu
Now that we are ready, battle start! this line could be snaped back to the frame.. qc's call
But I'm not going to lose.
But, even so!
She's stopped at three more left.
Seconds!
But let's call it a day since we did get to eat a lot.
Ai Sha was being mean and so...
It's also my first time seeing such a monster eater.
Oh I'm not that good.
Oh, you're not?
I'm going to treat you out of the reward I got in the Eating Competition.
That only goes for you...
I surely gave back what I borrowed, but they made some strange bond before I knew it.
We are having them stay as appreciation for saving you.
What's the matter, Zhang Fei?
What were you thinking?
You're lying. You were actually thinking of Ling Ling-chan, weren't you?
Sis, I'm back.
What? You're here to be screwed again?
I'm telling you I'm not going to play safe today.
What funny kids.
I thought you were children, but you three have some skills.
Ouch!
Though I was hired with money, I am at least their partner.
H-Here...
Don't come close to those siblings ever again, okay?
YES!
What are you going to do now?
Goodbye.
Ai Sha! Ai Sha!
Ai Sha...fill this in-campa
That's well... umm you know... how should I say...
All right?
Zhang Fei's acquaintance?
HEY That was the previous one!
What is she?
In any case, I'm going this way as my fortune telling says.
What does it say?
Winner receives a large sum of money with sub-prizes.
Well, I've returned once to Xi Liang.
I did what I needed to and departed again for training but...
I'm getting the reward money!
Let's introduce the three warriors who got it up to the final round.
Xu Chu is eating with great speed.
Seconds!
You're from before...
I'm Xu Chu, given name Zhong Kang. - someone check
You are still going to eat?
Whether you are an eating practitioner or an ant-eater, you're going to get hurt if you get involved.
I'm telling you I'm not going to play safe today.
I'm going against children?
You are the one who's gonna feel pain!
How nice.
Damn, what is she?
I can come down if you wish, but that will put you in even more of a pinch.
H-Here...
Geez.
She's a strange person.
Thank you so much.
I mean, why did you come looking for me?
Of course...
All right?
Who is that black haired woman?
Notes: "10mankin manjyuu": 10mankin manjyuu is a parody on the 10mangoku manjyuu, a famous treat from Sitama
You could understand my feelings from seeing my posture,
but I couldn't understand your feelings from yours. I'm frustrated.
It's okay. If you train hard enough, you'll be able to read others' aura in no time.
I'm not sleeping here because I want to.
It's better for me not to say what I did.
Yeah. But going back shamelessly to get it now is...
Oh, not particularly.
Right. That's good. That's right.
Karin-sama.
What's wrong, Shunran? Are you still sulking about that?
Good afternoon.
I'm going to avenge my father!
Okay?
I never expected to run into her in a place like that.
To make things worse, Chouhi got in my way.
Why did you try to kill Sousou-dono?
She killed my dad!
Regardless of her reasons, she made an attempt on my life.
Sousou-dono, can you somehow bring yourself to spare Bachou's life?
Wh-What a ridiculous thing to ask, especially in a matter concerning a person's life.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Karin-sama!
Where's the assassin?
However, this doesn't mean I've given up on you.
How about you have a match with someone here and show me your skills?
Ah, well, that's just my assumption.
No way.
But if you keep holding a grudge against Sousou-dono for that and go after her life, it'll be bad for you.
Oh? Do you mean to say I made it up?
As you wish!
I'm going to take your head off to stir myself up for revenge!
It's already in the past. Don't worry about it.
A-Ah?! Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm telling you to stop!
The bill, for the eat and run.
Umm, if I'm tiny girl No. 2, then No. 1 is probably you...
Ah, true.
Hey, look at this.
Oh, just looking at it enchants me...
That might be, but if she did aim...
Wasn't it?
Of course.
And one of them might be planning to assassinate the son-in-law.
Says someone who was snoring with her stomach exposed.
Hawawa No fighting!
I see, you were from yesterday...
Oh sorry, I'll bring tea now.
What a fine weather.
otherwise we can not guarantee her life."
Koumei-dono, does this picture mean anything?
That means the tea shop's master was...
Well, probably.
you should stay here, as if you know nothing.
But...
So it's got to be you this time too!
Hey hey, it's getting interesting!
Now!
No, right after you broke in, some strange person with a mask came
Mo-th-er...
this is where we must.
Prepare to die!
Yeah, that girl tried to run after eating and drinking without paying the bill.
Oh I see...
That was such a misfortune.
All because of you I was...
Hey, don't get too familiar calling me Shao even though we've just met!
Koumei's treated as a tiny girl.
Who are you calling tiny girl!?
You couldn't have been traveling without no money.
Hey! what!? dinner is moving!
What are you doing, idiot!
Possible or not, you saw it right before your eyes.
Isn't it just a coincidence?
By the way Shoukou-dono,
I hope so.
That is!?
and a letter was left there.
I see, so that's why you had no choice but to accept the assassination.
This...?
Do you have some idea of where my daughter is? - her voice is annoying
Please tell me where.
But...
Kannu-san...
Why would I, Shao-sama, have to commit cheap robbery?
What?
I can't take off any more. to have it aired on Japanese TV
Diversionary tactic working...
Kannu-san!
Please, get me there on time.
Kannu-san...
Oh, he comes!
Hurry up!
Rinrin isn't my daughter but...
The vow meaning a vow of sisterhood,
Next time on Koihime Musou, Episode 8.
Enshou tries to dig for treasure.
That's enough!
The bill, for the eat and run.
Oh I see...
Since that girl escaped because of you.
Hey, wait up!
Hey, dinner.
Wait!
Wow, it hit. no we are going to have fried crow
What are you doing, idiot!
What's happening?
Isn't it just a coincidence?
I thought so.
Thank me for yesterday?
I see, you were from yesterday...
Guan Yu-san, what are you trying to say?
Well, if there was some genius as good as the God of Archery, Qu Zhangname not 100 correct methinks, the impossible can become possible.
and a letter was left there.
"Your daughter is in our captivity,
If you are to consider the life of your daughter first,
But...
Huh?
Yes, to save her we need your help.
So, is this enough? bra? ancient china ftw!
Hey hey, it's getting interesting!
I can't take off any more. to have it aired on Japanese TV
Yes!
Mo-th-er...
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Ling Ling-chan was...
Ling Ling isn't my daughter but...
So...
All because of you I was...
All right?
Until the previous city that is.
It was love at first sight in the shop.
What's happening?
Her aim could have been off and it coincidentally...
That is, umm...
I have issues!
What is that look for?
Wow.
That is quite disturbing.
Ahh.
That was to prevent suspicious people from entering. and you guys were ok?you know, the beautiful black haired bandit hunter thingy
Hey, don't say things out of your imagination!
Tomorrow after lunch, that parade is coming to the street right before here.
intermission
There is nothing to be thanked for.
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Huang Zhong, given name Han Sheng.
You can easily see the main street.
Don't move!
Ling Ling, you can come in now.
and a letter was left there.
How dirty!
Unforgivable!
What are you asking me to do?
There was nothing else I could do to save my daughter.
Kong Ming-dono, does this picture mean anything?
Something she saw from the place she was held captive?
Please wait.
If you are to consider the life of your daughter first,
So you mean...?
That was close.
It must be my imagination.
Rather, it's so ordinary that it's boring.
No, not enough!
I have no name for you filthy creatures to hear!
No, right after you broke in, some strange person with a mask came
we don't have time right now.
Lili-dono, let's go.
Hurry up!
Why didnt you fire the...
Though it's difficult to part with you,
Oh, that means...
Don't say it in a way that people will misunderstand!
Yuan Shao tries to dig for treasure.
You don't have to repeat that part!
Ahh, bathing is the best.
Reiha-sama!
What Iishe, what happened?
Something to show me?
So now, hurry.
Geez, that's enough!
That's true, but please look at this part.
Whose erratic spending did you say?
I smell something awful.
Oh everyone, it's not that. It's the smell of sulfur.
I'm the first one in!
There's no water... no water and rocks only causing this mist would mean... burning hot rocks... burnt flesh... orz
almost no water spouts anymore.
My ass is red too!
What a pity.
I wanted to go in a big bath too.
Of course, I can't assure you'll find one.
I also think that's a possibility.
I'm saying that this isn't fun and games.
Yes, with that decided,
How cute, Shunran.
So I don't know for sure how we can reach that marked place.
What is this!
Reiha-sama, please calm down.
intermission.
I'm very bored.
Yes.
Oh, a rabbit!
We lived together ever since he was a cub.
But we ran away without thinking, so we've lost our way.
I'll check the map then.
Putting orange skin on the tip of her nose works too!
Wait... Wait a second!
I understand how you feel, but she has her position to uphold.
Oh? What's wrong?
Oh, it's my grandma, who passed away when I was young.
Reiha-sama! No matter how many times we pinched and hit you, you didn't make a sound!
There wasn't a need for me to come all the way here to look for treasure.
Girls with small breasts are small-minded indeed.
I am not Perverted Mask! I'm Kachou Mask!
No point quarreling when we finally got ourselves a hot spring.
Did you enjoy this episode of Koihime Musou?or enjoy
We dig it up and we'll get tons of gold and jewelry.
Oh, that's...
Just like the management of troops, we need to make changes.
It's a good thing we came.
I-it's not me!
Ouch!
Hawawawa...
We can't bathe if it's like this.
We will catch a cold.
Truly...
It can't be helped.
What is it?
why don't we and you compete to see who finds the hot spring first?
Yes, that sounds fun.
if we lose, we'll be your followers like you asked.
But if we win...
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
We just have to win.
Or are you feeling jealous?
Success or failure, why don't we jump in and beat the hell out of them?
Wait Iishe,
It's 34! - this is what herhis point was in kouei's game I think... someone check lol
Don't we often go to the toilet together too?
Who's Ranran?
I never thought we'd meet again!
I'm the one looking stupid here!
That's right. No matter what, I think it's not good to tell the truth.
No, don't come any closer!
Besides, with our clothes off, it looks like we've scored a complete victory.
Come again?!
Hey, you!
That's right! Doesn't that imply that I'm dumb as well?
Hey. Which side are you on, Shunran?
No, Karin-sama should be the most sensitive.
Fine with me!
Li Yu-sama!
Hey, I'm naked...
It's all right.
What are you going to do if it's removed later?
Hey Zhu Zhu Zi...
Episode 9 Yuan Shao tries to hunt for treasure.
And the water is known to have skin beautifying effects.
That is true, but...
Being there all alone...
I should work...
There's no water... no water and rocks only causing this mist would mean... burning hot rocks... burnt flesh... orz
You are...
That part below is nice and wet as usual.
How could there be no water in the hot spring?
According to the villagers, about half a month ago, after a large earthquake,
But I think it's worth a try.
I'm saying that this isn't fun and games.
this map has many lost parts from bug erosion.
What is this!
we come from behind and find the chance to snatch it.
intermission.
I wonder where they went together.
Are they going to the toilet?
Yeah, that's right.
It's said that strange natural phenomenon occur in places like that.
It really is Ran Ran!
That cat-eared strategist, next time I won't let her off that easily.
Oh, you are that one with an intelligence of 24!
Where are we?
It's all right.
After all, I've found something more precious to me than the treasure.
Do you understand? This hot spring was discovered by me! You'd better be thankful to me!
Oh my! I think the flat-chested girl just said something.
Hey, don't fight amongst ourselves.
Is that right, Hua Lin-sama?
Look! Look!
Hello, I am Xiahou Yuan.
Next time on Koihime Musou Episode 10.
Episode 9 Yuan Shao tries to hunt for treasure.
Time for the preview.
It's all right.
Geez, that's enough!
Let me see...
They have the saying "you can't ever have enough money or babies diapers".
Having a relaxation trip to a hot spring during a time like this...
Chun Lan, don't make such an evil face.
I didn't mean it like that.
That's right.
Ouch!
Why are you here?
According to the villagers, about half a month ago, after a large earthquake,
Umm everyone,
Does that mean we find another place where hot water spouts and we dig?
But I think it's worth a try.
I also think that's a possibility.
Wait a second!
Yes, that sounds fun.
If we win in this competition,
But if we win...
Okay?
That's true but...
You have no confidence in winning?
You found it?
Trying to get in my way again.
Li Yu-sama, we can see that out of them, the one who looks powerful is Xiahou Dun.
I wonder where they went together.
The treasure is here. If we move the rock...
Ready. Go!
Oh, nothing, I thought I heard something.
We lived together ever since he was a cub.
But Grandpa said Ran Ran has grown up, so we should return him to the mountains.
I'll check the map then.
Hey, shut up!
Oh, it's my grandma, who passed away when I was young.
Li Yu-sama! No matter how many times we pinched and hit you, you didn't make a sound!
Do you understand? This hot spring was discovered by me! You'd better be thankful to me!
So what if you found it? You found it by chance anyway.
Oh my! I think the flat-chested girl just said something.
Right. Though Zhu Zhu Zi is like an extra.
I was only stating the truth.
How about enjoying ourselves?
Did you enjoy this episode of Koihime Musou?or enjoy
Renfa, no need to be so formal.
What is it, Renfa?
Sonsaku has done this time and time again to raise the name of our family.
Why do have such a displeased look?
but if we stop here, we may dominate the Koutou region, and only end there.
Well, being too smart is a trouble after all.
Yes.
I have given my thoughts many times,
going before us traditionally important chief retainers and interfering with politics.
Isn't it great?
They will cry from happiness at my return and there's no way I will be scolded.
How worried do you think everyone was?
There is none!
an8Do you know how much trouble you are causing?
Kannu or whoever, it seems my sister has caused quite a bit of trouble.
Hey, Rinrin!
Hide under the bed! Hurry!ep1
Heh, trying to boast sticking out your thin bust isn't cool at all.
And what stupid thing are you-
Shuuyu!
The wound isn't too deep but,
I don't have definite proof but,
If Kannu-san who was alone in the hunting grounds is suspicious,
that means you, who were also alone is at the same degree of suspicion.
especially in hard times like this, it is the duty of someone reigning upon others to calmly judge things.
Oh no, if you understand that's enough.
Yes, all like planned.
Concerned?
Shuuyu-sama.
Let me see...
Giving shame upon a martial artist without proper evidence.
the main episode has already finished.
Oh no, I was too late.
Then at least let me give the preview.
but for that, the building blocks of the country, our people's lives, are battered.
Meirin, when it is only us, we promised to call each other by our true names, right?
Sonken-sama is too inclined to what she sees before her eyes.
That's true.
she will protect and nurture.
They all show their bellybuttons.
Then it's fine.
By reading them, an ecstasy called knowledge comes like a wave.
Umm, it's a bit different for me...
As you wish!
And what stupid thing are you-
And how is sister's condition?
Don't screw around!
How could I plan to assassinate Sonsaku-sama?
especially in hard times like this, it is the duty of someone reigning upon others to calmly judge things.
I understand you're concerned about Sonsaku's condition but,
Oh, it's the opposite.
you want to say?
Take her away.
It can be considered her misfortune that she coincidentally was there.
But never did we think that Sonken-sama would catch the nonexistent murderer of the assassination plot.
I'm afraid so.
I wanted to talk much more about books.
I was totally wrong that time.
I feel that way.
I don't know if it's kachou or jichou but,TL Note: jichou - to be prudent
Kannu meets Ryuubi.wtf??? ryuubi exists now??? orz ps2 edition
Even if there's a river, don't pay it any mind!
Hey, don't sing that weird song so loudly. It's embarrassing.
What are you saying, Aisha?
That's what Grandpa told me.
But even though you said you'd show me the shortcut to the village,
Thank you very much for saving me.
No, no, you're exaggerating.
Your name is similar to mine. It's a good name.
"Just as it's reassuring to have traveling companions, it's... it's..."
At first, they thought it was a bad joke and just ignored it.
A human could not possibly have lifted that rock.
Honorable Village Chief, the rumor about a monster appearing is true after all?
as well as traveling swordsmen, to exterminate the monster.
Another person said that its whole body was covered in thick hair, and that it had a scary roar.
What? Have you got a problem with that?
I'm thinking that even though the moon is quite beautiful, there are too many clouds.
When we were having dumplings at the tea house yesterday, did you eat one more than I did?
O-Okay.
Good luck exterminating the monster.
...a monster.
So before you knew that, you really were scared.
W-We failed last night, but we won't this time.
The food you made the villagers prepare was to feed the dog?
E-Excuse me...
I serve under Toutaku-sama, the governor-general here. "here" as in where she's pointing at -guu
By the way, Ei-chan,
Toutaku-sama, that's already in the past.
because there aren't enough soldiers to keep guard, right?
Fine, we'll keep them.
Wait, Yue, you can't perform such a dangerous parlor trick!
Next up, Ryofu. I'm going to stay quiet for thirty seconds.
Sun Quan, what are you saying!
Collapse?
N-no, I didn't say that...
Xiao Qiao
No matter how hard it may be, we must fight for tomorrow.
Zhang Zhao-dono, you are the eldest of us.
Can't you remonstrate them?
but nowadays she takes importance in Zhou Yu.
I sure look forward to Zhou Yu's cry when things unfold.
It sure is great, but nothing you should be proud of.
The "back at home" part is okay but,
What are you saying?
How worried do you think everyone was?
I empathize with you.
Then it's fine.
Kong Ming-dono said she wanted to see the library, so Lu Xun is guiding her.
Aren't books good?
By reading them, an ecstasy called knowledge comes like a wave.
Guan Yu-san wouldn't do such thing.
I don't have definite proof but,
Yes, I did.
Because you are master and followers who see each other every day.
Gan Ning, withdraw the sword.
I am sorry, Guan Yu-dono.
you were still awake?
Sun Ce-sama's condition has turned for the better.
How fortunate, sister.
Sun Jing-sama, I shall take you under arrest for treason.
the blood spilt for that shall someday hold grudge upon the Sun family.
I have already accepted that.
Yes!
It will become concrete proof of their treachery.
Yes, surely.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I think you, being able to do so, has enough of what it takes to be someone who reigns upon others.
It sure is.
Finished sending them off?
the main episode has already finished.
Oh no, I was too late.
If so, then it's okay but...
You seem to want to say something.
Sun Ce has done this time and time again to raise the name of our family.
Surely through repeated wars our land has increased and our family's name is made known to the nearby lands,
Collapse?
N-no, I didn't say that...
Da Qiao and
are going to sing!pleeasse don't sing you dickgirl!
Our mother who was called the Tiger of Jiang Dong, the late Sun Jian.
No need to worry.
Yes.
I have given my thoughts many times,
but nowadays she takes importance in Zhou Yu.
Yes, the preparation is already complete.
So finally.
If the war-maniac Sun Ce is removed, and she becomes the head of the Sun family,
It sure is great, but nothing you should be proud of.
It's okay that you got tired of journeying and felt like going home but,
How many times do I have to tell you?
How could you do such actions in the first place?
I empathize with you.
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Kong Ming, the Sun family of Jiang Dong welcomes you.
And are the guests awake?
Kong Ming-dono said she wanted to see the library, so Lu Xun is guiding her.
Yes. Since I love books.
The wound isn't too deep but,
No... Sister...
Yes, I did.
That means when Sun Ce-san was hit, you too, were alone at the hunting grounds in the mountain.
Oh no, if you understand that's enough.
What's the matter, so late at night?
You may meet her if her fever goes down.
Sun Ce, you should have...
It will become concrete proof of their treachery.
After time goes by and she gains the position suiting her talent...
Guan Yu meets Liu Bei.wtf??? ryuubi exists now??? orz ps2 edition
episode 11 kannu meets ryuubi
The enemy has collapsed.
Ah, good.
Kannu-dono, Chouhi-dono, and Koumei-dono I see.
What's the matter, commander of the volunteer army?
Umm, was his volunteer army having so many repeated losses?
The landlord here is righteous and honorable, I've heard.
If the provoked bandits come out, we battle for a short time,
Bandits who take advantage of the chaotic era to harm good people.
Damn it, those volunteer army guys doing sneaky things.
I'll first return to the fort and regroup.
Hey, open the gates.
We, the volunteer army, have taken this fort.
I only give small advice.
As expected of Chouhi-dono, you sure are brave.
It's no match for your beauty.
Kannu-dono.
D-does that mean!?
Yes, but just a little more.
and blooms on the third day.
The world circled around me the moment I ate it.
The mushroom Bachou-san had was probably Saikedake.pun on psyche-dake
We have troops on guard for that, though.
We should also make a moat and make the walls high so that if the time comes, we can shut ourselves into this castlemansion to fight.
Not that but,
Hey, Chouhi...
It's like the younger sister's jealousy after having her favorite sister taken.
Come this way if you're angry.
They might have played tricks on you because they wanted to make friends with you.
Rinrin volunteer army incoming!
Incoming!
There is, right here.
That's why this village is called Toukason with the characters peach, flower, and village.
Could you possibly be planning on joining that army?
All right, then I will have a will in my heart.
And get my Green Dragon Crescent Blade!
Kannu-san!
Nice to meet you.
I am Kannu.
Oh, you were as I had expected.
Since he looked really strange, at first I thought he was some bandit gone homeless.
Around here we have fierce bandits running rampant.
To give justice to those unfaithful beings and bring peace and calm to our people,
Know that your fate ends here!
After the enemy comes to about the middle of the valley.
Such great strategist like the historical Chouryou, who helped Ryuuhou, the founder of Kan Dynastyhan dynasty, rule the country.
It's no match for your beauty.
W-what are you saying?
Huh?
but I don't want to stay like this.
I will make myself famous through exterminating bandits,
It's very effective in bringing down fevers.
Oh, it's an uncommon shape of flower.
In one day it sprouts,
on the fourth day it dies so...
Well as I said, while in the process of training I used up all my money.
Enemy attack, enemy attack!- lol ry
how scatterbrained could you be?
we don't have to do that much.
You say the same thing as Aisha.
It's like the younger sister's jealousy after having her favorite sister taken.
This is my worst ever mistake.
Rinrin volunteer army incoming!
Hey, you brats!
There is, right here.
All right! When the peach flowers bloom here, we shall watch flowers.
Right!
Well, hmm since you'd have to pass through two or three mountains from here so...
Could you possibly be planning on joining that army?
And get my Green Dragon Crescent Blade!
I don't really understand but,
Hey, what are you doing?
And this is...
What did you say?
What's the matter, commander of the volunteer army?
Ah, I see I see.
Wha-!?
will you not help me?
If the provoked bandits come out, we battle for a short time,
Guys, let's beat the hell out of those volunteer army wimps.
Know that your fate ends here!
With me and Ai Sha here, there's no need for complicated plans.
As expected of Zhang Fei-dono, you sure are brave.
The moon?
W-what are you saying?
Guan Yu-dono.
I don't consider myself fit as a ruler of someone heroic like you,
Well if it's like that...
Oh sorry, but just a little more.
It's very effective in bringing down fevers.
But anyway Ma Chao, being dead on the roadside there,
Then after a while, I saw some mouse with huge ears mickey mouseand some noisy quacking duckdonald.
Him as in...
Come on.
It isn't.
I see, such bad kids?
Have flower viewing. Make a decision on what you wanna call it lol
Idiot.
It's great when it's in full bloom.
Master, how long will it take until Tao Hua Cun?
So I thought I'd help out.
Hey Bro,
And also...
Tao Hua Cun
Liu
episode 12 Guan Yu carries out her will
Ling Ling, I saw another weird dream because of you.
What's the matter, Guan Yu-san?
It's quite noisy.
Kong Ming-dono, get back!
Yes!
Given name Yun Chang.
What's the matter, commander of the volunteer army?
Well surely.
To give justice to those unfaithful beings and bring peace and calm to our people,
The landlord here is righteous and honorable, I've heard.
We thought of having him leave the village if he lost this time but...
It surely becomes peaceful around here.
Not only for Guan Yu-dono and Zhang Fei-dono's bravery but,
Such great strategist like the historical Zhang Liang, who helped Liu Bang, the founder of Han Dynastyhan dynasty, rule the country.
That's right.
Wiping out bandits is so easy.
Since the moon was too beautiful.
what in the world happened?
That huge eating midget Xu Chu, I recalled, was picking lots of edible plants in the mountain.
Enemy attack, enemy attack!- lol ry
You don't have to laugh that much.
It can't be helped since I didn't know this place was the headquarters for the volunteer army.
It's not that I don't understand your ideas but...
Not that but,
that's one way of fighting a war.
Wow, it's really whit-
What was that for!
Come this way if you're angry.
What's funny.
Ling Ling bandits incoming!
Peach flowers bloom greatly.
Well, hmm since you'd have to pass through two or three mountains from here so...
Yes, what is it?
Eat well, sleep well, and play well.
Though it's no match for your beauty, Kannu-dono.
Rinrin, I know how you feel, but you can't go to war in such a condition.
If you say so, I will stay behind and protect the village.
Get well soon.
Rinrin!
Most of them shall come out of the mountain.
Too lenient.
If we kill their leader, all shall be well.
If I remember right, you're from the volunteer army.
However large the number of enemies trying to shoot arrows at the imperial court,
Wow.
I've begin to see a way to change the world.
R-Ryuubi-dono...
It smells weird.
The only ones left are the watchmen and the villagers.
You were a bit too late.
What!?
Koumei-dono is taking command and has gathered the villagers into the landlord's mansion and having a defensive battle but...
Ryuubi-dono, please send reinforcements now to the village!
That's not what I'm talking about!
Oh, hey!
For a friend!
Shunran, take your men and go on a reconnaissance mission.
Yes, immediately!
Put top priority on helping the wounded.
so I shall protect the village no matter what!
What are you waiting for? She's alone. Get her!
My body isn't moving as I want because of the fever...
Even the Black Haired Bandit Hunter is here...
Enemy attack!
What? Sousou's army came?
And at another time, the ambassador of beauty and justice, Kachou Mask.
Sei?
Those who can fight, make pairs and fight a single enemy.
Then I can't be losing here.
They're too strong!
We will be withdrawing now.
Oh! He's the bad guy!
Then...
Hey, wait up!
Kannu-san, he's the culprit who kidnapped my daughter, Riri, and tried to make me perform an assassination.
His words about being Prince Sei of Chuuzan's distant relative is a bloody lie.refer to prev ep
We don't know if his name really is Ryuubi.
Everyone, we are ready for the flower watching!
Since you are, after all, my sister.
That tale is to be told in some other time, some other place.
Let me see...
and the government army wants all available help. I duuno if these are government army or Kan army...
Right!
They say somethings don't get sick, so this isn't a cold!somethings  baka
I'll stay behind as well.
Then we will begin the military conference.
A frontal assault will only lead to meaningless casualties.
If it goes well, we might be able to suppress the uprising without battle.
Yes ma'am.
Now, please drink it.
Bosses.boss and the people,
I went to see just in case but,
Right.
Bachou's unit will be mounted attackers,
According to messengers who arrived just now from the village,
Koumei-dono is taking command and has gathered the villagers into the landlord's mansion and having a defensive battle but...
Oh no.
Bear up!
But, isn't saving the village more important?
Think only about me.
Rather, for justice...
So... please!
Understood.
After that, reinforce the west tower.
Rinrin-chan!
I can't stay in bed when things are like this.
I'm not letting you through!
Those who have a death wish, come out!
Aisha!
All right, fire!
Talk later. Protect the mansion now!
It seems to have gone away after a bit of workout.
I think you probably shouldn't do that.
You will find yourself bound to her bed again.
We will be withdrawing now.
Right!
What!? Kouchuu, why are you here?
Oh shit!
Y-Y-You were watching!?
You knocked him away at the final moment.
I want to know.
Everyone, we are ready for the flower watching!
A participation request by the government army?
Oh yes, it sure is beautiful.
I'm not sick!
Since fools do catch colds, you do have a cold!
But Guan Yu-san...
So, can I ask you to guard the house?
Get well soon.
It can't be helped. Let's fight without Zhang Fei-dono and Kong Ming-dono. hmm when I played the game, I almost always lost wars without Kong Ming participating XD
By lenient you mean?
Please, protect me.
What's the matter?
L-Liu Bei-dono...
I see.
It looks like my chance has finally come.
It's their turn to find out their fort has being taken over when they come back.
Kong Ming-dono is taking command and has gathered the villagers into the landlord's mansion and having a defensive battle but...
Wha-?
Get me through!
Nice shot.
How could someone as great as Guan Yu choose someone like that as her master...
Cao Cao, I have something to tell you, please listen!
Chun Lan, take your men and go on a reconnaissance mission.
You can't be going to battle in such a condition!
Go, go! Press on!
My promise with Ai Sha...
Ai Sha!
Talk later. Protect the mansion now!
It seems like it's finally payback time.
Our boss!
How strange.
and with absolutely no winning chance with the great warriors Guan Yu and Ma Chao out,
Yes.
Guan Yu-san, he's the culprit who kidnapped my daughter, Lili, and tried to make me perform an assassination.
From what I've heard, uprisings are happening everywhere,
they might not be that large of an army.
All right.
If you say so, I will stay behind and protect the village.
Understood!
we can admit mistakes of our previous practices and tell them that all who give up arms will have their punishment reduced.
Most of them shall come out of the mountain.
If we kill their leader, all shall be well.
If I remember right, you're from the volunteer army.
Well done for saying so.
When you admirably get his headneck,
Guan Yu-dono, let's begin the conference for tomorrow's plans...
No, nothing.
Umm...
It's brewed Three-Day Grassrefer to previous ep, very effective in lowering fevers.
you will be hauntedit will be a sin if you don't drink it thankfully.
I see.
Yes, tonight I shall have payback for last time.
Ma Chao's unit will be mounted attackers,
What's the matter?
Liu Bei-dono!
What happened?
their numbers are quite large.
We have to hurry! While we're doing this, our village is...
If we gain achievement in tomorrow's battle, I will become a commander in the government army!
But to fix this chaotic world and save many people, we need to gain a far greater power.
Stop it!
I see. And what do you want me to do?
That's what she gets for choosing a stupid master.
I have no duty to save her.
Hua Lin-sama!
Understood.
Hurry up and depart!
Yes, immediately!
Put top priority on helping the wounded.
After that, reinforce the west tower.
You can't be going to battle in such a condition!
Ai Sha told me to guard the house while she's out,
Damn you!
I, Huang Zhong, will be your opponent in archery.
Black mounted soldiers?
It seems like it's finally payback time.
And at another time, the ambassador of beauty and justice, Kachou Mask.
It was great help.
and work for dominance of this world.
Then...
Not really. I'm just extremely unhappy.
I apologize for eating your bamboo shoots while you went to the toilet. I'm sorry.
Right? Right?
They're my favorite food, so I saved them to eat last.
Bamboo shoots...
I'm okay...
Bamboo shoots...
What's wrong, Shuri? You're in such a panic!
There are travelers here, but one of them is seriously injured.
Thick fog suddenly occurs around here all the time.
Thank you so much.
Sorry for troubling you.
Ah, but I can't even go to the toilet this way.
I'm sorry to trouble you for everything.
Don't mention it. You'd do the same for me if I were in trouble.
Please.
The Master said, "Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application?"
I-I'm not! L-Lin Lin and I aren't mother and child, we're sisters. On top of that, we're sworn sisters.
That child lost her parents when she was small.
I see.
The Master said, "A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful.
I want to become a person who's helpful to others, like sensei.
But to do that, I think I need to study all kinds of things more.
Ah, sorry. Because Suikyou-dono does that from time to time, I couldn't help myself, but...
It's a medical herb that's really effective on this kind of swelling.
It's okay. I've gone there with you many times. I remember the location.
Wh-Why?
Just a little more. Just a bit more...
Okay, Lin Lin-chan.
You'd do the same for me if I were in trouble, so there's no need to thank me.
I'd like to ask you for a favor, then.
Yes.
I want to fulfill that wish.
She can't hear from here.
Good work for the long run, Sei.
Hey, wait a second!
This is my first school day as a transferred student, but I overslept.
I'm sorry ... Kan'u !
I'm sorry. The place, where they sell bread, was crowded more than usual.
So, calm down and take it.
But ...
Aisha is stupid.
There's no such alternatives in this Academy.
And the winner team will become president of student council.
Maybe because she is a fool.
That was too much stupid words from you.
This is kind of rude.
Don't use my sister to press me, I have my own practice.
It'll be shameful, to give up participating. That's why, give it a try ...
But ...
That dog eats too.
What should I ...
Students, prepare yourself for the student council president election.
So, welcome the new era.
Un - deux - trois, you know it ?
Chouun will run with Bachou and Kayuu with Ryofu to the victory.
Why you ...
I thought, I can buy it too, to lower it's stock to reduce her strength.
That so selfish.
In the first round is an aquatic fart elimination series.
Can they make any counter-attack to defeat ...
Iishe, Toshi ...
Are you afraid ?
Eh, that is ...
The finalist are ...
She like to say things without thinking.
How could I sacrifice you to obtain the Victory.
I was wrong ...
Give it back to me !
Why, why you have my eel sandwich ?
Stop it Rinrin ! This is the last one, which Koumei bought.
But, I have decided to eat the eel sandwich as my daily lunch staple food.
I'm sorry, I don't know about that.
Hey, wait !
There is one president with 2 generals and one military adviser makes a 4 squad teams.
And the winner team will become president of student council.
I'm sorry, maybe it's an important time for your team, but I created such a bad atmosphere.
But, what should we do if she doesn't come, we don't have enough people.
I don't want to hear any excuses.
If we're going to compete for the student council president election, we'll lose.
And just because of your sake, I serve you until now.
This will attracts much attention, to have a rare talented member.
Such disobedient tiger that no one cares, not even their baby ...
Actually, at the day they returned to the dormitory, they gone out together.
Be generously.
But ...
The meat package looks very delicious.
Oh, welcome.
I never thought about it.
But, Karin ...
On white trunk, General Kousonsan.
Kan'u team against Toutakus.
Chouun will run with Bachou and Kayuu with Ryofu to the victory.
Let's go, Ryofu !
Chouun and Bachou is marching with one voice.
Ah, it's a problem ! That dog is being bullied.
Let's wait of the jury's evaluation.
The notes, created by the senior general, decide the victory and loss.
Now, let's start it !
Oh, what happens here ...
I thought, I can buy it too, to lower it's stock to reduce her strength.
As we promised, you can eat all eel sandwiches, but give your best later, right ?
Although I don't want any people, other than Karin, to see me like this.
She defeated the Sou Sou team completely.
Kan'us team against Sonkens.
Eh, that is ...
Either with a cry or smile, we reach the final.
Her enemy would be ...
I meant, a hero of justice, the Butterfly Mask.
However, is it fine ? The Butterfly Mask isn't registered as kan'us team member.
Both of them have a good start, but the Butterfly Mask is in advantage.
You deserve it.
But why ...
You and me are in a competition.
Therefore, it's Enshou's team victory.
konkyo nante atashi dake
It would be a paradise if i came.
The reason is because Im the only one.
How about you guys just come out?
Geez, this is the end of the world.
Kids...
They were calling themselves the "Lin Lin Bandit Group."
Right now, she's all by herself.
Today was a big success too!was: It's a big success today as well.
As expected from our boss.
Me too.
Hide under the bed right now. Hurry!
Nah, I didn't call myself that.
The rumor was unreliable.
This is annoying.
I wouldn't be Kan Unchou if I fell for such a trick!
She fell for it.
Fell for it.
Hey!
Really?
Ugly woman, idiot, old woman!
You don't have the right to call me that!
I'll return you the favor ten times over to avenge my friends!
Even though you have such strength, you're just using it to play a bandits' game.
I decided never to let something like that happen again.
This world, in which innocent people are hurt because they get caught up in wars and attacked by robbers? - this whole line is what she meant by "it" in the previous line -guu
Just... Just that I've always, always felt lonely!
H-Hey, what's wrong?
I'm going back, then.
How is the water temperature?
It's just right.
What? What's the matter?
Well, there's a theory like that... or perhaps not...
Somehow, I think a statement like that could lead to a misunderstanding.
Besides, I've never done anything before that would bring me a child...
H-Hey, I haven't accepted yet.
To change this world?
Nope. It's just that none of the people in my bandit group came to see me off.
Hm?
People remember others' faces when they part, until they meet again.
Okay.
At the end of the second century AD, this world is in disarray.
If dedicate my life to someone, I will even go beyond my own boundaries!
Umare izuru tenmei wa kono te ni kiseki o yadoshita
I was only pursuing the truth, but when I realized it, you were there.
Kioku no sumi ni utsurikomu kirihanasenai kanashimi mo
It would be a paradise if i came.
Run away quickly if you dont like it.
gaman shite koi mo nakucha
katte ni mawatteru nante maji
Because thats impossible, isnt it?
Why don't you call me by my mana, "Lin Lin"?
My name is Kan'u. My courtesy name is Unchou.
And this person is...
Kan'u-dono.
Then who's the seme, and who's the uke?
A-Ah well, let's leave that topic till later.
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
The ones with ambition to rule the whole country are all out looking for talent.
I can beat you to a pulp easily.
After hearing about it the other day, I've come up with a plan.
I'll take it on.
I'm sure you couldn't stay quiet even for a single moment.
Piece of cake!
Don't worry. It's not like I'm not inclined that way at all. In fact, I rather prefer it.
I-I know that, but your knee...
All right. Let's get the village girl to serve us sake again.
But there are so many of them.
What rust are you talking about?
Chouun.
Oh, yeah! Grandpa said that if I was lost in the mountains, I should look at a fallen tree.
It's the exit!
Got it!
Aisha!
That was close.
Let's go, Chouun.
In that case, call me Aisha too.
It's strange.
What's the matter?
Gloriously riding on a white horse, "White Horse General Kousonsan is here!"
Kousonsan-dono is definitely not a bad person, but that's all she is.
When I go shopping, it always takes me there and back.
East, south, west, north, anytime and anywhere,
If you wait on it, youre going to lose your love too.
You shouldnt be going around any way you like,
Yes! Yes!
Wait, what do you mean by that?
I suffered an unbearable humiliation because of you two.
It disgusts me that a fool of a feudal lord would act so arrogantly.
Oh. They're already standing at attention outside the gate.
She just meant your hair. She didn't mean anything about your head.
That's right. Aisha's lower part is also moist and slick! wow
But unfortunately I have some minor business to take care of right now.
I was hungry. I couldn't help it.
Now, Kishuu's Number One Martial Arts Tournament is finally about to begin!
Please fully enjoy the matches between the heroes who have gathered here today from across the country.
Now everyone,
Competitor Chouhi stopped a blow from a double-edged axe that ordinary people can't even lift!
You can't defeat me at that level!
Competitor Chouhi has beaten the favorite, competitor Tetsugyuu!
One minute has already passed since it began.
Competitor Bachou just keeps on defending.
Kishuu's Number One Martial Arts Tournament has reached its final match.
What's with her? She's small, yet why is she so strong?
What a feast.
In any case, the match you two put on today was really splendid.
Nah.
Well, simply put, it's something like a guest.
Those two are strong, so they'll definitely strengthen our war potential.
Okay?
We came from horse-riding bandits ourselves, so we're not exactly suited to judge others, but...
Now, the surprise Enshou army aptitude test has begun.
How's that? Behold the power of someone with thirty-four degrees of intelligence!
D-Don't stare at me like that.
I know fluttering clothes like these don't suit me.
But after all, it's...
Didn't I tell you to stay at the inn?
Bachou is...
At this time, at this place, it will become my strength and lead me to tomorrow.
Run away quickly if you dont like it.
You shouldnt be going around any way you like,
Luxurious and gorgeous, theres no arguing about it.
Yeah. I felt the cloudiness from your posture.
Sorry for tossing and turning in bed.
Yeah. But going back shamelessly to get it now is...
Etsu  is also known as Yue in Chinese. It was a country in ancient China, from 600 BC to 334 BC.
Whenever he licked it, it would remind him of his need for revenge.
Karin-sama.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't be so sullen.
A porter's job pays better than I thought.
What's going on?
Wah, it's Sousou!
You aren't with that black-haired girl today?
I see, so that's what happened.
You and Sei go back to the inn together.
Sousou killed my father.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
That was careless of me.
I thank you for saving me from the hand of the assassin.
so look forward to the day when it happens.
Yes, ma'am.
Batou-dono, what do you say?
Even though we demanded that the people who'd been present keep quiet, others had seen it from somewhere else.
But in that case, Sousou-dono...
That's the kind of person she is.
I'm going to take your head off to stir myself up for revenge!
Wh-What's with her?
She doesn't have... any openings at all.
That means what she said was true after all. My dad was...
It's already in the past. Don't worry about it.
Th-There's no need for a kid to know!
the fate that has befallen me fills my hand with miracles.
I was only pursuing the truth, but when I realized it, you were there.
Run away quickly if you dont like it.
Raise your hand when youre comfortable.
Dont be unreasonable, but have some tea instead.
mucha wo sezu demo ne ocha wo shite
daitan futeki ni nerau hitomi ha muteki ni
Yeah
How mean, deceiving me like that.
...2ndgoing to...
No, no, you're exaggerating.
"What're you trying to do by getting me drunk?"
Oh, Kaku, eh?
It's not!
Kaku, you'll die young if you worry so much.
Tied to the arrow was a letter that said,
Yes. We were at our wit's end and tried appealing to the government officials.
W-Was the monster that scary?
Someone else said it had sharp fangs and horns.
These women warriors are so strong that they defeated the scary bandits instantly.
Thank you very much.
When we were having dumplings at the tea house yesterday, did you eat one more than I did?
Just when I started thinking I had no choice but to camp out,
a lukewarm wind, out of place on a spring night, blew in from somewhere.
Watch out!
No, that tickles.
You're not one to judge.
Do you know how worried I was before I found out where you were?
Ah, I see.
Toutaku-sama, that's already in the past.
I'll issue stern orders to the government officials in order to prevent an incident like this from happening again.
You mean... all those dogs?
because there aren't enough soldiers to keep guard, right?
How's that? Isn't it a good idea?
Fine, we'll keep them.
I-I'm telling you, though, this is the only time I'll agree to such an unreasonable request.
Wait, Yue, you can't perform such a dangerous parlor trick!
Uh, you're right.
Wasuretai keshiki ga ari wasuretai kioku mo aru
At this time, at this place, it will become my strength and lead me to tomorrow.
Ima naraba koko de nara tsuyosa ni kawari asu e tsuzuku yo

There are countless things that i want.
katte ni mawatteru nante maji
Yes! Yes!
Yeah.
But that's not the case.
Lin Lin, all because you were too greedy.
Okay, okay. Let's try that way, then.
There's really no end to it. Just kidding!
This is bad. We won't even know if we stray off the path.
Let's go find her.
Besides, it feels good to have your squishy breasts against my back.
Please! Please!
Thick fog suddenly occurs around here all the time.
You can stay here until your foot heals.
My name is Shokatsuryou. My courtesy name is Koumei.
Ah, but I can't even go to the toilet this way.
It tastes good.
Oh? What kind of food can you make?
L-Like rice balls, and nice rice balls.
Um, in that case...
Oh, what's this?
q0She's obedient, smart, and she likes to study. In addition, she helps out with the housework, too.
Nah, Lin Lin isn't at all.
Besides, above all, she cares about her mother a lot.
Where did you get that idea?
She and her older and younger sisters were all separated from each other.
After that, she ended up at my teacher's place for a while, but eventually I took her in.
What's the Saronpa herb?
It's a medical herb that's really effective on this kind of swelling.
I'm sure it grows around here.
Why? I-I just happened to be passing by. Just happened to!
So far up the hill?
You're the one who found it. I'm just helping out.
Um, Chouhi-san.
Lin Lin-chan and I picked it together.
You took such great care of me, but I have no idea how to thank you.
You'd do the same for me if I were in trouble, so there's no need to thank me.
I think it might cause you trouble, but I want you to take Shuri with you on your journey.
Yes. She's said before that she wants to go on a journey and see the world.
Ima naraba koko de nara tsuyosa ni kawari asu e tsuzuku yo
I was only pursuing the truth, but when I realized it, you were there.
dou nan sha pei itsudemo dokodemo
It will be a grand adventure both today and tomorrow.
kyou mo ashita mo daibouken
Raise your hand when youre comfortable.
Luxurious and gorgeous, theres no arguing about it.
Her name was...
It's Chouun.
It was a total disaster.
If you say so...
Koumei-dono said that because of you...
Didn't you go back to your home town of Seiryou?
Yeah. I'm planning to win that and get the prize money.
which taste just okay, each of them can eat.
So now, if you're ready, let's begin!
Is this as far as I can go? Is this as far as I can go?
Now that I think about it, what happened to Kan'u and Chouun?
Eh? You lost sight of Chouun, had a fight with Kan'u, and split up?
Hey!
You're the one from back then.
My name is Bachou. My courtesy name is Mouki. I came from Seiryou.
By now, we should've already paid back the money we borrowed.
I don't care if you're a competitive eater or an anteater,
but you're going to get hurt if you poke your nose into the wrong thing.
Who are you calling shorties?
Damn it, if I'd known that, I would've squashed them for real!
No, please don't do that.
I-It's nothing. Nothing.
Yeah.
But at this rate...
By the way, what happened to Chouhi?
Hey, I'm leaving this with you.
You threw a wet blanket over our fight, just as it was about to get interesting.
That's why I'm asking you what you're thinking.
Show your face!
Lin Lin, Bachou, it's been a while.
Hey! I don't know where you learned my name,
I'll take care of my comrades' misbehavior.
Hey, take the debtor's contract out.
My, my.
What happened to Koumei?
Aisha... why did you turn back?
Wh-What's with her?
Lin Lin, what are you saying?
Koumei-dono said that because of you...
Oh, fine. You're good enough to be my opponent.
Now, now, now, the annual Big Eating Tournament is finally coming to a close.
Next up is the competitor whose tiger hair ornament is not just for decoration!
Last up is competitor Kyocho, whose amazing appetite you won't be able to believe, given her tiny body!
Well then, the final battle will be decided by how many Juumankin buns,
Is this as far as I can go? Is this as far as I can go?
I-I didn't do anything wrong!
You're the first ones who could get that far against me in an eating tournament.
I wasn't praising you.
but you're going to get hurt if you poke your nose into the wrong thing.
What a cruel thing to do!
Kan'u-san, let's turn back now.
If we walk the whole night, we might be able to catch up with Lin Lin-chan somewhere.
Kan'u-san...
Thank you very much.
I'll say this in advance, though: I won't go easy on you this time.
Hmph, you're the one who's going to have a hard time!
Nice spirit. Otherwise it wouldn't be interesting.
Hey, throw down your weapons, or else this kid's gonna get it.
Wait a second. What are you thinking?
You threw a wet blanket over our fight, just as it was about to get interesting.
Now, you guys, hurry up and drop your weapons...
The messenger of beauty and justice, Butterfly Mask, is here!
Speaking of weird people, that weird masked person...
Aisha!
we might be able to meet you.
Why? Obviously, I came to look for you.
Ah, this is tiresome!
Gareki ni umoreta hikari moshi mo sore ni kizuitara
Yeah
dou nan sha pei itsudemo dokodemo
Run away quickly if you dont like it.
Raise your hand when youre comfortable.
Yeah
hoshii mono nante ikura demo aru
You shouldnt be going around any way you like,
Yes! Yes!
You villain, who mistreats the weak, I'm going to punish you right now!
Hey, wait.
Anyway, you guys will serve me, Sonshoukou, the youngest daughter of the Son family that reigns over Koutou here.
Hey, food.
Here, look at this.
When I saw it in the store, it was love at first sight.
Did she miss?
What formidable skill.
In other words, my judgement is always right.
I'm not doubting you or anything, but do you have any proof?
Ah, thank you very much.
Are you here to see the parade tomorrow after all?
You dare say that, after snoring and exposing your stomach?
H-Hey, where are you going?
Thank you for helping my companion the other day.
I like to poke my nose into others' affairs, so I couldn't help but drop in uninvited.
Nevertheless, the heads of the people passing by on the main street look like specks from here.
Don't move.
It seems you can't handle a long weapon as well as you can a bow and arrow.
Lin Lin, you can come in now.
Instead, there was a letter.
If you follow our instructions, we will return her to you unharmed.
What a dirty ploy.
What on earth do you want me to do?
I wonder.
Koumei-dono, what about this drawing?
What she could see from where she's confined...
The criminals know your face. If you go there, your daughter might be in danger.
But...
Kouchuu-san...
What do you want?
So? Is this good enough?
What's wrong?
What did you say?
Please, make it in time.
Ah, a child?
I-It's not like that! What she meant by "pledged" is the pledge of sisterhood. It's not that...
Enshou Digs Up a Treasure.
Repeat after me.
Gareki ni umoreta hikari moshi mo sore ni kizuitara
The reason is because Im the only one.
yappari chakkari sekai no shuyaku wo atashi
Yes!
Hai
hai hai
That's right. It's a treasure map.
Who did you say wastes money?
We've been unkind to Shuuran, leaving her behind to take care of the place all by herself.
Yeah, but I can't let my whole council take a vacation together, can I?
But this is a hot spring!
But now our pleasure trip is ruined.
Hey, since we're looking for it,
Competition?
Then we just need to win.
It's so exceptional that it can find a winter melon buried in the earth, not merely a hot spring.
I don't think we're lost.
Reiha-sama, as far as I can see, Kakouton is the only one among them who is skilled.
What did you say?!
Reiha-sama, please calm down.
And after that, what then?
I'm thirsty. Let's do this after we get a drink of water from that river we passed earlier.
Yes.
But grandpa said it had already turned into a grown-up bear,
As proof, Lan Lan has a tuft of white fur under this armpit...
Let's get it.
I'm the one without a leg to stand on!
q0Yeah. Whatever the circumstances may be, I don't think you should speak the truth so directly.
Reiha-sama, I thought you were dead because you didn't say anything at all, even though I pinched and slapped you.
It's a hot spring.
Toshi, did you hear it?
q0It does indeed suit Enshou's army of battling idiots, who care only about quantity and not quality.
You also have to consider the color, shape... and sensitivity.
Ah! If it's about sensitivity, I'm number one.
That would be most welcome!
There, there!
Did you enjoy this episode of Koihime Musou?
Sonsaku's Life is Threatened.

Dont be unreasonable, but have some tea instead.

You shouldnt be going around any way you like,
Renfa, you don't need to be so formal now.
However, the citizens, the foundation of the country, are exhausted from it all.
Preparations for the banquet are...
my late mother, Sonken, known as the Tiger of Koutou.
Don't worry.
It's ridiculous that she controls policy, completely disregarding us hereditary vassals.
apparently my younger sister has caused you quite a bit of trouble.
Really? Then that's all right.
Books are good.
Shuuyu.
We have no evidence.
When Sonsaku-sama was shot, I had left Kan'u-dono's side to pick up Shoukou-sama's kill.
then you're equally a suspect, because you were alone too.
To say that I plotted to assassinate Sonsaku-sama...
is much stronger than that of a traveling warrior who isn't related to the Son family at all, don't you think?
I'm telling you to drop your sword.
Even though this is a turbulent age, it's still pretty sad.
I see. It's over, eh.
Now, see us off on our trip with a smiling face, okay?
It feels like everything was too perfect to be true, as if we were watching a play...
Rikuson, what do you think of Koumei?
Gah! In that case, let me sing a song instead!
Uzu no you na mayoi o tatezu ni shita o muku PURAIDO
the fate that has befallen me fills my hand with miracles.
Spring, summer, autumn, winter,living in comfort,

I play the leading role in this world no matter what.
Yes!

The reason is because Im the only one.
konkyo nante atashi dake
Stop it!
What? A woman?
Got it!
What happened, Mr. General of the Volunteer Army?
Oh, a volunteer army?
They ended up losing all seven battles.
Hey, open the gate!
You're not in the least inferior to the famous tactician Chouryou,
I just gave a little advice to everyone.
That's right.
I want to improve my reputation by exterminating bandits, and recruit more soldiers.
So that's what you meant by wanting to be with me...
There are more wounded people lately, because of the continuous wars.
It brings on hallucinations. Someone with ordinary nerves would probably have laughed themselves to death.
In war, if the general's killed, everything's over.
Eh? Well, if you think normally, that's how it should be...
This is the failure of my life.
The Lin Lin Bandit Group wasn't the same as those newbies.
All right.
Yes, what is it?
Hey, Ani-chan. What should I do to grow up as big as you?
Wasuretai keshiki ga ari wasuretai kioku mo aru

Raise your hand when youre comfortable.
Be fearless, be unmatched in keeping your eye on it.
Yes!
A punitive force was dispatched against them multiple times,
I don't like the idea of serving under that upstart Kashin, though.
The government forces are seriously short-handed right now.
Even though the supreme general is taking the field herself,
Oh, you're right. It is beautiful.
Since even an idiot can catch a cold, you've caught one.
Sorry about that.
Yes.
Besides, this time the rebellion happened because the local feudal lord imposed excessive taxes.
When the rebels have been starved out, and their morale has crumbled,
If all goes well, we might be able to put down this rebellion without fighting.
The rebel army is just a disorderly crowd after all.
How about it? Is there anyone who will take the vanguard and bring me the enemy commander's head?
No matter how many tens of thousands of enemies rise in revolt against the Imperial Court, I won't be scared.
Ani-chan, I've seen how to change this world. Please look after me.
R-Ryuubi-dono...
It smells strange.
You're a little too late.
This fortress is in the hands of the Volunteer Army now.
But...
For the sake of our brilliant justice,
My ambition is to protect the ones who truly deserve my love to the end!
Lin Lin, Koumei-dono, please be safe!
H-Hey!
Got it.
Sousou...
There's no way I can be the only one sleeping at a time like this.
Aisha asked me to take care of the village, so I'll definitely protect it.
And then I'll go view peach blossoms with the village children.
Aisha!
All right, fire!
Yes, Ma'am!
Geez, you.
You're the same as usual, Sei.
Y-Y-You saw it?!
Dareka ni sasagu inochi nara jibun no kyoukai mo koete
Wasuretai keshiki ga ari wasuretai kioku mo aru
you will definitely be taken a step forwards a new page.
Flower of Bravery!
East, south, west, north, anytime and anywhere,
Peach blossoms, eh?
bring it on!
If only the government officials had gotten off their butts,
This world has become unpleasant.
The Lin Lin Bandit Group is passing through!
Kids...
Wh-What was that about?
When she was small, robbers broke into her house and killed her parents.
After that, she was taken in by her maternal grandfather, who lived in a mountain hut. literally she said "grandfather of her mom's side" but it sounds tedious, so i put "mother's father" -guuwas: a hut on a mountain.
Oh, yeah. The picture we drew on the wall of the village chief's house the other day was erased. wiped out
See you tomorrow! We're going to play bandits again!
When tomorrow comes, I'll be able to see everyone again.
That's amazing.
Did something happen?
This time, he just won't take it anymore.
Only at a time like this do they...
Even though I want to commend you for being clever kids...
Kan Unchou, this is the failure of your life.
Twisting floor-cloth!
Really?
Of course not. I promise you.
I guess.
It seems you just won't listen to me.
Even though you have such strength, you're just using it to play a bandits' game.
H-Hey, what's wrong?
Yeah.
Bye.
I changed my mind.
Hey! Don't jump in!
I... I don't dislike it at all.
If you're an older sister, can I call you onee-chan?
Or should we drop by the hut one more time?
I'm not crying.
At the end of the second century AD, this world is in disarray.
you will definitely be taken a step forwards a new page.

Does your stomach hurt?
Why don't you call me by my mana, "Lin Lin"?
It's normal for close friends to call each other by their mana, so isn't this weird?!
You're right, but we just got to know each other.
I want to call you by your mana, but you haven't told me what it is.
My name is Chouun. My courtesy name is Shiryuu.
My name is Kan'u. My courtesy name is Unchou.
You have quite a big child, considering your age.
Me?
The ones with ambition to rule the whole country are all out looking for talent.
The old royal family of Kan has already lost its power.
To help me rectify the chaos in this country, please lend me your power, at any cost.
Kousonsan-dono...
Well, that's true.
Hm, I see.
Nah, but I...
Oh? So what's the plan?
Listen. While hiding in the load and going to the robbers' hideout, you'd have to hold your breath.
That's not true! I could do it if I wanted to!
Yeah. It's a little cramped, but it can't be helped.
We're going to have a hard time finding the exit.
Damn you, how impudent.
I will make all of you part of the rust on this Seiryuuengetsutou... eh?
Sorry.
If the bandits realize that I've escaped, I don't know what they'll do to the kids.
And, you told her?
Oh, yeah! Grandpa said that if I was lost in the mountains, I should look at a fallen tree.
Lin Lin.
Why?
Just hurry!
It's all over, eh?
Yes. They did a wonderful job discovering the robbers' hideout, but...
But?
I'm sorry.
If dedicate my life to someone, I will even go beyond my own boundaries!

Oh. They're already standing at attention outside the gate.
We can set out as soon as we meet up with them.
I see.
My name is Sousou. We'll meet again if we have the chance.
Welcome back, goshujin-sama.
I was hungry. I couldn't help it.
Go back to the inn and stay there.
In any case, I'm going to earn a lot of money and surprise Aisha.
There are too many complicated words, so I can't read it.
The winner will receive prize money?
Then if I win, I'll get a lot of money.
Now, Kishuu's Number One Martial Arts Tournament is finally about to begin!
Now then, before the contest begins, let me introduce the organizer of this tournament.
The governor-general of Kishuu, head of the super-noble En family, Enshou-sama!
Everyone, welcome to the martial arts tournament that I organized.
You brat...
Sh-She did it!
Oh, this is amazing. Their moves are as quick as lightning.
Then, I'm going to make my move now!
She did it! Competitor Chouhi once again finished her opponent in an instant!
Me!
This match is a tie.
Well then, everyone, the closing address will be given by none other than me, from the noble family
This is delicious.
Therefore, I'd like to discuss something with both of you.
What's a guest general?
Wh-What should we do?
Okay?
Both of you saw the strength of those two yesterday, right?
Yeah.
Then do it like this. Isn't it simple?
Now, the results of the vote count are in!
What are you saying now? It's all or nothing for this match.
It's even a little too much for me.
Wait, you girls.
Bachou Attacks Sousou.
There are scenes I want to forget, and there are also memories I want to forget.

If you have a sense of guilt in your heart, your aura will be cloudy.
You could understand my feelings from seeing my posture,
Nah, no need to apologize.
it's important for us to be pathetic."
I'll wipe you down right away.
Shunran, don't you have something to report to me?
We've also captured the leader. Right now, Kakouen's unit is wiping out the rest.
How about I summon you instead of Keifa to my sleeping quarters tonight?
I see, so that's what happened.
I'm surprised that we're meeting again in such a situation.
I will definitely stroke that beautiful black hair of yours,
so look forward to the day when it happens.
Shunran, hand Bachou over to her.
What you said to yourself just now, could you do that again in front of Bachou?
No way.
Oh? Do you mean to say I made it up?
I'm going to take your head off to stir myself up for revenge!
Nah, don't worry about it.
And... umm...
It's already in the past. Don't worry about it.
Eh?! A swindler?
Umm, Shao, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Ha ha, she called Koumei a kiddie.
q0Umm, if I'm Kiddie Number 2, I think you're probably Kiddie Number 1...
I had enough traveling expenses with me, until I reached the previous city.
Because I wanted it.
Ah, looking at it like this makes me feel, like, enraptured.
You thief!
O-O-O-Ouch!
I'm not doubting you or anything, but do you have any proof?
But if that's the case, why are you traveling without any servants?
Huh? Parade?
Oh, you're not? I was sure that...
Mistress, what parade are you talking about?
This conversation only stays here.
You dare say that, after snoring and exposing your stomach?
What formidable skill.
H-Hey, where are you going?
A guest to see me?
My name is Kan'u.
Nah, I'm thinking that if there's an archer whose skill equals Kyokuchou the God of Archery,split

If you follow our instructions, we will return her to you unharmed.
And then, at the meeting place...
Koumei-dono, what about this drawing?
I think your kidnapped daughter probably drew what she could see from where she's confined.
Could it be the house across from the tea store?
Do you have an idea of where my daughter is?
Kouchuu-san...
Kouchuu-dono, I promise I'll save your daughter, even if it costs my life.
I'm coming in.
That was close. If I'd run out just now...
You swindled me just the other day. What are you saying?
Geez, still not yet? I can't strip any more than this, after all.
Here.
Since things have turned out this way, I have to take a chance.
Really, don't say things that can be misunderstood!

Oh, Kaku, eh?
My, my. What a bothersome governor-general, neglecting her work to take a stroll.
"Have food ready in the temple outside the village tonight.
W-Was the monster that scary?
Someone else said it had sharp fangs and horns.
What's wrong? Did something appear?
O-Okay.
Y-Yeah.
Now that I think about it, it happened on a moonless night, just like tonight.
...a monster.
Be careful. It's her.
The food you made the villagers prepare was to feed the dog?
Um, I'll have fried rice and dumplings.
Y-You do need it, after all.
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but who on earth are you?
I serve under Toutaku-sama, the governor-general here. "here" as in where she's pointing at -guu
No, I understand. She's already apologized about it in person, too.
It would be a great help if you would do that.
By the way, Ei-chan,
Um, that...
Wait, Yue. I didn't say it was okay to keep the dogs!
I-I'm telling you, though, this is the only time I'll agree to such an unreasonable request.

Let's dig in!
I-I appreciate your consideration, but that's kind of...
Ah, do you mean you want a bigger one?
"Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"
q0She's obedient, smart, and she likes to study. In addition, she helps out with the housework, too.
She's energetic and cheerful. I love her.
I see.
The Master said, "Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application?"
It's not scary. It's not scary.
I'm finally here.
I'm sure she'll be scared and give up halfway.
M-More importantly, we need to pick the Saronpa herb.
Welcome back. My, you got pretty dirty.
I feel bad this way.
When I was young, I also traveled around, saw more of the world, and learned a lot of things.
Um, i-is this really my final task?

That was uncalled for!
Anyway, I'm going this way, according to the fortune-telling.
Serves her right!
But I won't lose.
Damn it, I'll be left behind by those two at this rate!
Th-This is bad. I'm reaching my limit after all.
Nah, I'm not as good as that.
I wasn't praising you.
Eh, you're still planning to eat?
By now, we should've already paid back the money we borrowed.
Kiddo, debt comes with interest.
Who? You, you, and this one.
Shut up, shorty!
You said "shorty" again, "shorty..."
We already paid back the money we borrowed,
Indeed!
Who are these people?
Eh, why?
We asked these people to stay over in gratitude for saving you.
Kan'u-san.
What is it, Koumei-dono?
Is this enough?
My.
Wasn't she with you guys?
I was sure she was with you.
You guys took good care of us yesterday. sarcasm -guu
I'll say this in advance, though: I won't go easy on you this time.
You guys are interesting.
Wh-Who are you?
Hey...
You guys know her?
Hey! I don't know where you learned my name,
Are you okay with that?
Hey, take the debtor's contract out.
Speaking of weird people, that weird masked person...
I'm sure it will have more and larger big eating tournaments.
So Koumei-dono suggested that if we waited on the roads near the exits from the city,
Why? Obviously, I came to look for you.
Stop drinking and do the preview!

Hey! What are you doing? Let go of me!
Yeah. That little girl was trying to run away without paying for her meal. That's why...
Ugh, what a complete disaster.
I'll let you be Shao's servants.
Hey!
I had enough traveling expenses with me, until I reached the previous city.
Ah, looking at it like this makes me feel, like, enraptured.
What are you doing?!
Could it have been... accidental?
Maybe her aim was a little off, and it just turned out that way.
But, if she did it on purpose, it really was a superhuman feat.
Are you really the youngest daughter of the Son family?
I'm not doubting you or anything, but do you have any proof?
No matter how you think about it, it's strange for a princess to stroll around alone, showing her belly button.
Hey there, don't whisper like that, I can hear you!
And what's that?
How disturbing.
Exactly. It's a long-awaited ceremonial day. How unpleasant.
Remember, when we entered this city, we were examined closely.
If that's the case, the feudal lord must have arranged plenty of guards for tomorrow too.
A guest to see me?
Gratitude for yesterday?
my young daughter Riri and I lived quietly in a village just a short distance away from this city.
I see. That's why you undertook the assassination unwillingly.
This one?
Could it be the house across from the tea store?
Fine. If that's what you believe, I'll let you search me naked to see whether or not I stole your stuff.
N-Not yet. You've still got your skirt.
All right!
Kan'u-san...
Eh, my, that means...
At this time, at this place, it will become my strength and lead me to tomorrow

Who did you say wastes money?
Well, well. There's a saying that the more money and baby diapers, the merrier.
You're right.
It's true that the more money, the merrier.
Aw, I can't wait for the hot spring!
Only connoisseurs know about this place.
Shunran, don't make such a scary face. I won't leave you out.
We've been unkind to Shuuran, leaving her behind to take care of the place all by herself.
Yeah, but I can't let my whole council take a vacation together, can I?
There's no water.
Why is there a hot spring without any water?
Yes.
If we win this competition, you guys will be my servants.
But, if we win, Kan'u will be mine, okay?
Hey, w-wait, you can't just...
Reiha-sama, please calm down.
I wonder where they're going as a whole group.
No way. I'm a princess, so I hate doing sweaty work like that.
That's why I asked the villagers about legends or experiences like that and marked those places on the map.
Yes.
But grandpa said it had already turned into a grown-up bear,
It was definitely a trap. A trap set by Jun'iku.
Let's feed her squid and onion till she's scared.
Abalone livers would be good too.
You're pretty obsessed with that.
This place is...
Reiha-sama, I thought you were dead because you didn't say anything at all, even though I pinched and slapped you.
Iishe. Toshi.
Because I've found something that's more important than treasure to me.
Hmph. Even though you found it, I'm sure it was by accident.
Oh my. It seems the little girl with tiny breasts said something.
Yeah. She said something that sounded jealous.
Or did all the food you ate go into the fat of your useless breasts,
Linking huge breasts to an inferior brain is an outrageous theory!
You also have to consider the color, shape... and sensitivity.
Nah, no matter how one views your appearance, it can only be Perverted Mask.
You're right.
Did you enjoy this episode of Koihime Musou?

Preparations for the banquet are...
Hi!
Ah, so this is where you are.
Sonsaku-sama...
You're right, Sheren-sama.
I've been thinking about Sonken-sama.
You're right. But that's also to her benefit.
I have such a feeling.
Meirin, you're just thinking too much.
Choushou-dono, since things have turned out this way, let's carry out that plan as soon as possible.
If we let that person become the leader of the Son family,
Close your eyes and don't move.
You still seem to be sleepy.
It'd be a waste to just let her go.
Bow wow!
The poison was sucked out right away, so she managed to escape death.
No way! Nee-sama...
q0At the moment when Nee-sama was shot by the arrow, a traveling warrior of unknown background was up there.
If I remember correctly, one of your subordinates should've been with her at the hunting ground as a guide.
Yes, it's strange.
Kan'u-dono, I'm sorry.
I tried a bit too hard.
Respected Aunt.
Sonken-sama!
I'm glad. Nee-sama, I'm really glad...
Shuuyu, did you plan all this?
I leave that to your imagination.
Geez, it was improper of me, as someone who holds authority, to do that.
We can reach our destination while relaxing like this.
Yeah. It'd be nice if we could relax like this while traveling on land too.
Yes. Was this incident really just an attempted assassination?
Kan'u Encounters Ryuubi.
Gah! In that case, let me sing a song instead!
You don't need to sing. Leave already!
At this time, at this place, it will become my strength and lead me to tomorrow

What's wrong, Kan'u-san? It's so noisy.
O-Okay!
Kan'u-san!
Wh-What is it with these guys?
No matter how many lives we have, they won't be enough to fight them!
Oh, really? So you've returned with a victory.
I'm asking you to help, for the sake of all the people in the land.
While Ryuubi-san leads another unit...
Damn the Volunteer Army for playing such a dirty trick.
Once I get back into my fortress...
You're a little too late.
Ryuubi-dono.
Eh? D-Do you mean...
I tried to look for some too, but I had no idea whatsoever which ones were edible.
I hit the jackpot, in a sense.
Ack, where's the toilet?
It's an enemy raid, enemy raid, enemy raid, enemy raid, enemy raid... Hey, wake up!
But, but, mistaking the patrolling soldiers for an enemy raid...
I think we should consider the real possibility of an enemy assault.
Keeping them to himself...
My, my. The younger sister is jealous that her beloved older sister might be taken away, eh?
It's snow.

Instead of taking the time to starve them out, we'll crush them in one go.
Yes, Ma'am. In response to your expectations, I will definitely return with their commander's head.
I look forward to your success.
I will make you my aide.
Really?
What a weirdo.
Koumei-dono will definitely
and it's irritating to have the bandits steal the funds we saved up in the village.
Just think about me.
I can't believe someone like Kan'u would choose a guy like him as her master.
Stop it...
I'm under no obligation to save her.
There's no way I can be the only one sleeping at a time like this.
And then I'll go view peach blossoms with the village children.
Shuri, I leave the rest to you.
Understood. I wish you luck.
Your head is mine!
Kinbachou and...
You villains!
Geez, you.
Kakouton-dono, thank you very much.
Listen, that man was...
Hey, wait!
Everyone, the preparations for viewing peach blossoms are done.
That story will be told some other time.
But...
The academy is that way.
My pride falters because I cannot stop the swirl of my hesitation.
If you notice the light buried under the rubble,
What if your stinginess causes me to go hungry,
and air leaks from my belly button at a critical time...?
So don't worry about it, Koumei-dono.
As your older sister, I need to correct your selfishness.
But if your younger sister is asking for something,
It's such an important time for your team, but I went and ruined things...
You shouldn't feel responsible, Koumei-dono.
That may be true, but...
We can't afford these miscues right before the Student Council Wars.
But...
This ramen sandwich is good, too.
Me, fight in the Student Council Wars?
Beginners welcome, as long as you're motivated!
Nobody's here anymore.

it's the angel of death, Toutaku!
Dunno what's going on here,
Listen, Ryofu! Step with your outside foot on "one,"
Okay.
This one will be reviewed by the Executive Committee.
The judges' decision is that the teams crossed the goal simultaneously.
Oh, what have we here?
Yes!
It passes!
Isn't it great?
You're sold out?
Rumor has it that conger eel sandwiches are the source of Chouhi's strength.
Nothing is impossible for the noble house of En!

This round will determine the Student Council President.
She might win with the Enshou army, but she still fails at life: Bunshuu!
It's okay. She resembles Chou'un closely enough.
She may wet the bed at night, but she won't let that bring her down!
She... had some adult circumstances to deal with.
Well done.
She's very fast!
Due to her small and childish build, Chouhi incurs less water resistance,

What about after it dissipates, Iishie?
What's that?
Let me see.
That's right.
Yeah. Be ready tomorrow morning. We're going treasure hunting!
Aw, I can't wait for the hot spring!
We've been unkind to Shuuran, leaving her behind to take care of the place all by herself.
I had to leave someone behind, just in case.
What's wrong?
It can't be helped.
Hey, don't make the decision on your own!
Since it's decided, let's charge ahead!
What's wrong, Shunran? Aren't you confident about winning?
This map has worm holes everywhere.
Ah, but I'm sure it's around here... I think.
I'll remove the rock right away.
Do you have to do it now...
I'm going too.
Maybe to the toilet? Don't we always go together too?
One, two, three!
No way. I'm a princess, so I hate doing sweaty work like that.
Before we set out, you asked the villagers various questions and wrote something on the map.
That's why I asked the villagers about legends or experiences like that and marked those places on the map.
Geez, what was that?
It seems those people are also looking for the treasure here.
It might show the location of the treasure clearly.
Yeah.
Hand your map over to me,
I'm the one without a leg to stand on!
Grandmother...
Eh, but what about the treasure?
Listen, I found this hot spring.
making you slow-witted and unable to understand what I said?
There, there!
I wanted to go to the hot spring as well.
Next episode, Koihime Musou, Tenth Feast:
It was just a scratch.
In the end, we wouldn't be able to get our hands on the whole country.
q0No matter how painful it is, we have to fight for the sake of tomorrow.
B-But, Sheren-sama...
Meirin, you'll walk the path beside me until I fulfill my ambition, right?
Yes.
Isn't it astonishing? Isn't it amazing?
Putting that "I'm back" feeling aside, will you be all right, Shoukou?
Geez, what on earth were you thinking?
Yeah. Perhaps it's a tradition in this family or something?
So Shoukou-san wasn't just a silly child or whatever!
If you scold her more than that, she's going to run away from home again.
H-Hey, Lin Lin!
And in addition, my chest feels heavy.
Really? Then that's all right.
Koumei-dono said she wanted to take a look at the library, so Rikuson is showing her the way.
Please, Kannei.
The poison was sucked out right away, so she managed to escape death.
Big catch, big catch.
Kan'u-san, what happened?
Kannei-san, if you're a proud warrior, then so is Kan'u-san!
Sonken-sama!
Did you become impatient from hearing that my condition had improved?
I see. It's over, eh.
Yes, everything went smoothly.
We can reach our destination while relaxing like this.
Ah, what's wrong, Koumei-dono? Are you seasick?
Ah, Rikuson. Have you finished seeing them off?
Hey, I don't care if you're a section chief or a vice chief, the episode is already over.

Megalo! Mega Love! Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
Did you call for me, Mia-sama?
What else? It's about settling the score with our sworn enemy, Koi Koi 7.
For that reason, I have needlessly been depending on you.
I am putting all my cards towards your destruction!
Wonderfuldesu. Just like the babylon towerdesu.
Just kidding.
Let's go.
Otome, what are you doing?
Otome, you're very confusing!
If I do this, Tetsuro-niichan will be pleased too?
Well let's see now.
I'm home.
Onii-chan, is it ok if i get in the bath too?
The island was blown up!
 This Poseidon suit is invincible as the ocean is wide aru.
That is most definitely an incredible suit! Right!
Exactly, exactly. The important one is the superintendent. Not her, it seems.
Sato-san's lingerie figure is purely...
Ful!
Sato-san!
Take this!
Unforgiveable.
Even if it means the destruction of the world?
Prettydesu! So cutedesu!
From what angle do I look like a black panthernyanya?
He is moving.
What lies hidden here is the time-space oscillator archetype.
He's too quick.
The children still do not know their importance in this matter.
Absolutely, entirely unfathomable.
We lost, once againaru.
Even if we know we will lose!
Come to me, my angel.
Raise and spin it higher, the circus of your dreams
That man will certainly come here.

My heart's racing, about to explode.
It's beating so fast! Oh No! It's out of control!
so into your life of mystery a beam will shine.
At that time I fantasized about how wonderful a person he was
Your father was truly an extraordinary person, you know.
He is on the move.
Now then...
Excuse me.
So then, the research is halted?
Infinite Missile!
Are you the one to be saying this?
The truth is the truth, as you say.
Just the two of us?
Everything here hasn't changed in the slightest, eh?
Not good.
An energy surge has been confirmed in the space-time oscillator.
How does he plan to obtain the coordinates?
Hey! Wait, you!
This academy is an genotype pool.
If so, then it's natural the girls would be attracted to Tetsuro-san.
STOP!
Tetsuro-san, I'm sorrydesu.
Is that true, Tetsuro-san?
Tetsuro-san!
That's it for the crucial data.
If we could that would be lavish...
...but most likely.
It might become a little noisy, though.
Give back Yayoi-chan!
Don't get in my way!
Please show me the land in which you were born!
We all discover the first morning through a thousand nights
Yayoi-chan.
Let's make a start!
Come On And Ready go!

Oniichan? Oneechan?
The blue sky stretches forever.
Yamada-san, DON'T!
For me to carry on the legacy of our financial organization;
He hasn't changed a bit.
Systems are blue.
Drill missile: launch!
Wai! The deputy sisters today are so cooldesu. So strongdesu!
Come, its dangerous! Lets go over there with onii-chan!
Particle SF cannon, second assault: preparations ready!
New property venture? Where does it say that?
It seems so I think.
That's bad is what they're saying!
Blast it, what should we do?
Akio.
It's set to the same wavelength as Otome, so maybe it will pick something up.
All the girls started from the same basic body type, see?
Let's hurry and fix Otome-chan up.
We will ambush them on the island with the iron steel of justice!
Hot springs, for real!
Well, it seems Otome was not damaged so...
Y-yayoi-chan!
Its hot!
Confirmed!
Tetsuro-san's mother.
The plan will be:
Begin!
Here I go.
That's what's expected.
Grasp it with your hand.
Are all searching for a shore to land.
Tetsuro-san, RUN!
You must affirm reality.
Tetsuro!
Forever.
Together.
Man! Geez! What is with that, "I don't care pose!"
And again, huh? There's no way we can uplift the children's hearts with that!
That's some incredible powerdesu!
Now for the optimum!
AH! Tanaka-san you already have Asuka's devotion and you're already hitting on other girls!
Aaaaaand?
Hooow do you feeeel about...
Maximum power, Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
The two of them left on a bike.
Roger.
Hurry up and have the recovery team recover my Seydlitz.
So, this is Tanaka Tetsurou who will be studying with us starting today.
You two over there!
Even so, to think that that stupid boy was a transfer student...
We must teach him who is in charge here in this school.
In that case, try it on me.
I-I'm going to scream...
By the way, Yayoi-chan, why are you so kind to me?
Into the deep world of Gokou that no one knows.
Kazamatsuri-san, personal weapons are against the school code.
A good crop again this year.
Miya-sama is the school's real governor.
Now, Tanaka Tetsurou, pledge your obedience to me.
Uh... Um... Higashikazuno-san.
What an insult...
Tetsurou-san's in danger!
That voice... Yayoi-chan?
Even if you don't call us, we will soon arrive!
It's a Robot.
Then this means war!
I ain't going to hold back. I'm going to let rip!
My Gokou Committee Juniors, on this battlefield...
There's no way you can penetrate Bruno's armour with that pea-shooter.
I'm going to crush you!
It's like fireworks!
Hey, where are you looking?! Youko. Jinko.
This fight has only just begun.
A beam barrier?
You can fly, too?
That's why, I will absolutely absolutely protect you.
Yayoi-chan. Why are you here?
Inoukai Hifumi. I'm sure we'll get on.
It's been one hard to follow day...
Raise and spin it higher, the circus of your dreams
Dazzling and brilliant,
Let's make a start!
Megalo! Mega Love! Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
Roger!
Affirmative.
Fire!
Morning, already...?
Good morning.
That was unexpected...
Thanks, you're so thoughtful.
You've only just started, right?
And so you're asking how this fits in with their plans?
Please do not ignore me.
Like I said, a challenge.
Big bouncing breasts.
Okay, here we go!
Your execution is powerless, your style is worthless...
...so I don't know what you're talking about.
We won!
But...
Yayoi-chan.
And what in the world are you lot doing?!
...her attendants with her pride!
Cutting things with your hair.
Together with everyone, I might be able to give it my all here at this school.
In spring, spring flowers bloom,
Although we are but six strong, people call us Koi Koi Seven.
What the... is that?
Created with Higashikazuno's full effort, this gigantic warrior.
Amazing! It's amazing!
Do you like this kind of robot?
Incomprehensible.
Being combined is a combining robot's ultimate form!
It can't be helped.
If you're not going to surrender then we shall use force.
Wha...?
Is there something on my face?
I guess I might be.
If those precious to me are happy, I'm happy too.
It's unfair...
We all discover the first morning through a thousand nights
A heart loving of justice.
It's beating so fast! Oh No! It's out of control!
Super Love, Hyper Girl, the door of dreams
I found a good place, you know!
Tell us...
Myself too...
...to defeat evil for the sake of the weak...
Punishing Squadron...
What's up with you, Akio?
I won't allow it.
It's heavy.
Tanaka Tetsuro and those Koi-Koi Seven outsiders, eh?
Because, someone like me, has to be protected by Yayoi-chan and everyone else.
Say, Tetsuro-san...
Akio-chan?
Akio-chan...
...when I think about having been born again...
Born... again?
That's right.
...to all students: currently, this school is under a state of emergency!
Oh no, they've been captured!
...I've leave Yayoi-san to you!
Akio-chan,
At this rate everyone will be captured!
I missed... what am I going to do?
But even then, I...
Even then...
Ouch...
That's not true! It's not like that!
Really, it's really not like that!!
Thank you!
Tetsuro...
There is an empty swing set
Gently swinging, the pendulum of dreams...

Megalo! Mega Love! Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
What can I do for you?
Satou-san, you were really attached to that dog, weren't you?
Once you've done so, I can explain it.
The formula...
...please memorize it.
...so get in it before you catch a cold.
Ah. That's quite thoughtful of you, Tetsuro.
Of course...
That's right...
Eh... my panties and bra are also soaked.
Fool.
Tetsuro.
...she was a very cute girl.
Why was a middle schooler here at highschool?
Oh, I think that cheating is a bad idea!
Ah... I was just...
No matter how often Miya-sama is absent... no, such behaviour isn't allowed!
...nor does it age.
In that case, is my hand... warm?
You're gentle, aren't you?
Gentle?
A bath definitely warms you up!
Tetsuro... treated me as though I was a normal girl.
Otome-chan, are you alright?!
Are you listening? Hey!
In her own room.
Miyabi will bring Otome to my room.
Damage to the body is less severe than expected, isn't it?
Besides, it needs to grow much bigger before...
Her situation?  jijou 
...all of these memories are lost.
It's incomprehensible!
No... you can't do that...
I'm beginning to feel very good...
Tetsuro...

W-what should we do?
It started moving on its own.
No... my 'things'...!
Punishing Squadron...
U-Uhm...
Otome-chan, could that be...
With efficiency you mean...
Heya, Tetsuro...
It's again time for the Kino Ranger to mobilize!
No... forgive us!
Tanaka Tetsuro and those Koi-Koi Seven outsiders, eh?
We gain more information on them with every encounter.
I-I'm so glad...
Ah... It's good to work out like this once in a while.
Tetsuro-san, thank you.
All I did was crying all the time.
I... don't regret getting this body at all.
...isn't that just wonderful?
...it's good to change.
There's no need to reveal him yet.
Even if you ask me...
...I've leave Yayoi-san to you!
Let me get at least another hit.
Ah... Oh no!
Farewell!!
Uhm...
...could become someone's hero...

Sorry for bothering you, Tetsuro.
And dad was always busy with work, as usual.
Tsukuyomi-san, say "ahhh".
Eek!?
Yeah, "that" gotta be it.
A stupid ass tournament like this...
As I have promised, the winner of this tournament will be awarded...
It can't be helped.
A beauty with a nice body, making her very popular
Hmm?
You don't need to push yourself to participate.
Um, uhhh... yeah.
I didn't mean to... uhh, um.
Hohohoho
Waaa!?
Ahhh...
Say, Satou-san...
He's mine.
I'm a little jealous of you
The ones we are after are Koi Koi 7.
Against high speed underwater motors, can even Koi Koi 7 survive!?
As long as it's fun, anything goes!
It's not very amusing for me...
Gokou 5... evacuation complete.
Ahhh!
I want to be washed away, too!
Wow, it's high
Here we go!
What is this!?
But I will allow it since it's only the first offense!
Favor?
What could that be?
What is that thing!?
Hohohoho
There is no need to worry.
Now, please rest, okay?
You've finally smiled for me, Tsukuyomi-san.
Geez.
I shall crush every single one of you!
My orbital satellite station!
Huh?
We are saved.
Incomprehensible.
Tsukuyomi-san, is your hair alright?
Charming, lovely, a sound overflowing with melody.
Dazzling and brilliant,
But...
No!
Sigh.
Sakuya-san
W..What is it, Ako?
I'll go tell them...
The illustrators were empty handed and were crying to get the layouts back, so...
From now on, submit some finished products.
Keep up the good work, please
Background image: zero.
B..Because there are no films coming to my place.
Sakuya.
It is my policy not to voice myself in front of colorless film.
What the hell are you talking about?
Heh, is that so?
Thank you, Sakuya... san?
Stop turtling around.
Y..Yes!
Paint this color here...
Anime is so fun!
Take a long rest.
I made you wait...
Mind my own...
I'm relieved.
Their...
Emotional.
I mean, it's about scratching my flunked grade.
A Miracle.
There's absolutely no problem!
Strike a pose, Ready To Fight, Let's Go!
It's beating so fast! Oh No! It's out of control!
I knew it.
It hurts...
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
I had no idea that exchanging ribbons was proof of friendship.
Tetsuko-san, your smile is splendid.
Huh?
If we want to attract guests, then there's only one thing:
We've got trouble, trouble!
I'm on my way!
You always need to take good care of your appearance.
Asuka Yayoi!
I wasn't... even allowed to touch you.
Yes.
But she has a heart now.
What do you intend to do?
It's physical exertion.
It's hot.
My boobs got bigger again.
More importantly, where'd you get that ribbon?
Both the giver and the receiver do not take it lightly.
Tetsuro, do you have those feelings?
Well...
I didn't know... that it was so important.
Umm, well...
Higashikazuno-san?
Damn it...
What's going on?
Anyway we're saved.
Just, who was that girl?
Am I not good enough, Tetsuro?

Hey! Don't hog Nee-sama!
It'll be OK OK! They'll never figure it out.
The room's pretty dark, it'll be fine.
DON'T RUN.
I've heard nothing of this.
He insisted that he knew nothing.
Miya-sama seemed to be looking for you,
so I brought her here.
Oh yes, perfect timing.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Asuka Yayoi-chan, right?
I know. You're Tanaka Tetsuro-kun, right?
Kanou-chan, bad timing.
I want to talk to Asuka-san alone.
But your name isn't Yayoi so it's not OK.
Splendid, Miya-sama!

However, Celonius 28 continued to evolve and improve.
It kinda worries me.
Yayoi-chan, wake up Yayoi-chan!
Open this gate! Open it!
She's gone!
Tetsuro!
Touch me here...
Can you release it?
But when the syndicate began to understand what Asuka Yayoi was,
Roger.
Nothing will change by doing this.
Why did you make Celonius 28 go out of control?
Why do you cover her?
Out of the way!
So that will never happen again.
She has nowhere to go back to.
Everyone who wishes to participate in the folk dance, please head to the front of the school.

and even to young women!
Onee-chan, what are you doing?
Hey, can you see something interesting?
I'm making breakfast.
Hey, hey!
I've got a bentou for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Morning.
It's nice outside again today.
Akiyo-chan!
Well? Did you find her?
Is she a relative of yours?
Wanna fight?
Tetsuko-san, every time I think of you, my heart aches...
Tetsuko is so happy! It's like a dream!
I'm so happy too, my Tetsuko-chan!
Impressive! Kazuko changes type faster than anybody.
Do I have to help a tiny little brat like this?
Anyway, she's a thin little kid, isn't she?
How perceptive for a kid!
See, look! Her forehead is so big!
Wait, you brat!
I see.
Do as you like.
No, stay back!
Liar!
Once I relaxed, I got hungry...
You didn't eat either Gantai-chan.
While he still got Asuka-san!
I see.
Yamada-san, that's really...well that?
Anyway Onii-chan, about that lady I told you about, she's really strange...
Everyone, Tetsuro-san and Gantai-chan are back!

From that kind of thing happening...
Don't be like that.
You're doing great, Gantai-chan! I'm counting on you.
On your mark....
Was I wearing this kind of ribbon?
You seem soaked to the core...
Ah... This is... um...
Are you connected, Otome?
I-Is this the uniform you were talking about?
No!!
Ok, cheese!
Hey hey hey!
Your embarassment is just starting!
Shall we move on to the next set of photos?
Go, Horizonto Robo!
No!
Even around the fuddy-duddies this pose is... Too horrible!

Decided? Whatever do you mean?
What could you be dwelling on?
What else? It's about settling the score with our sworn enemy, Koi Koi 7.
What is it, Tetsuko-san?
No matter what angle you view from, it's a desert.
Gantai should be crafted into something other than a wild monkey, don't you think?
That snooty know-it-all! I'm really going to tell her off.
Get back!
Take this, you big oaf!
... thinking you can break through Cattleya Castle's defenses with such a toy!
Let's do whatever.
Excuse me, everyone! Is it really okay, leaving Gantai-chan?
What can I do to make Tetsuro-niichan happy?
As soon as he returns home, run to meet him naked in an apron.
As if... right?
Did you hurt yourself?
Surprisingdesu!

That's ridiculous!
Well, it can't be helped. Higashi Kazuna is the superintendent's granddaughter.
However, I like Tetsuro-san much moredesu!
I know this is annoying but... we ARE inside Cattleya Castle, right?
On the other hand, this isn't the Sky Dominion, but instead is the mountain lands.

The equipment has not deteriorated.
All the toys that I made long ago, just like that.
Yeah! Roger that!
What exactly is he up to?
This is... It can't be!
He has opened the gateway and is integrating our worlds.
We are the guardians.

The rest of you! It is time to realize the extent of our menace!
Drill missile: launch!
She's making some sparks now!
Let me splash her with water!
Why you! How do you plan to make this up?
Well then, everyone. Let's meet again!
This... might be a bit troublesome.
It ran away?
Lets make this today's final battle.
Right?
Is this ok? Should we be leaving Otome and lying around here?
Ooohhh myyyy G---!
Sato-san. For some reason, my body is getting so hot.
What's happening?
Nice idea, Akio-chan.
Mia-sama, they have already lost alot of stamina.
Whats that? The wind stopped.
What?

Eh? But you're not wet at all.
No...
Ah, I have got another one.
Ah... but we're still in highschool!
Is that so?
Okay.
Ah... sorry.

Otome-chan's hand...
Why..? How disappointing...
I'm not wanted?
I don't understand.
Don't tell me...Tetsuro ran away with Otome?
There's no problem.
E-Eh? W-W-What did you... Otome-chan?!
...so I wanted to properly let you know my feelings.
I haven't done anything!
Why?! Tell me, Otome-chan!
Otome-chan...
I... was... very... hap... py...
The next problem is...
So because of that, Sakuya-san has shut herself in her room?
Sakuya-san knows it as well.
Otome...
In this dormitory... holding pets should be forbidden...
You don't have to get that angry...

The first round will be 'Chitty Chitty! Go Go in Swimsuit! Get Tetsuro'.
Tanaka Tetsuro!
We understand, Poophead Kazura-sama.
Against highspeed underwater motors, cam even Koi Koi 7 survive!?
- It's not very amusing for me... - Sorry, then!
C'mon, you girls!!
Tetsuro-san!
Miyabi-chan!
Thank you...
Yay! It's another pool
Everybody is tired of waiting
Again!?
'Click' it goes!
Dost thou craveth for a man, money or fame?
Round 2.
Red vs. White: Tama-ire Competition?
No need for questions!
Favor?
Round 3.
Isn't that cheating?
They'll probably say something like 'all fire at will'.
You've finally smiled for me, Tsukuyomi-san.
Don't mind.
You shouldn't bother about it.
Waaa! That was scary!
Why would somebody use something like that on Yayoi?
Miyabi-chan...
That was Celonius Mk. 28...
Tetsuro... you're kind, aren't you?
Huh, what?
But...
This world isn't so sweet that a selfish doujin author such as you will be easily accepted.
iHardcore Spirit, Demon Sergeant! Production Manager: Sakuya-san
Hmm?
What are we doing?
Aim for Cannes! Aim for Venice!
So we're all empty handed.
Mind your own business.
Really!?
Umm...
I'm pretty sure there isn't anything to animate today, either. So it's more reasonable to do some garden work.
Haha, isn't that obvious?
Really?
I am just speaking out of Miya-sama's policy.
Well, let's forget about Higashikazuno's policy in this case.
We won't make it in time unless we do the audio recording with full color.
Eh?
One week will not be enough for the hapless Kazamatsun-san.
To say something incapable of doing.
Hghh... one week.
Stop turtling around.
Now, hurry and draw!!
Ah, she's snapped!!
Color... and color like crazy!
Paint this color here...
And there, we mix this and that...
I have a date today.
Staying up all night sure is tough.
You see... recent animes are all digital, you know?
I can't eat anymore...
So...
We're barely on the edge.
I'm late...
I mean, it's about scratching my flunked grade.
I guess that's it.
It's ero-ero!
Sorry...
At last it's done... my ideal concert stage!
Get to work!
It hurts...
Hey, Yayoi-chan?
What a beautiful girl!
That's the legendary Mimikani-Bread-Chocolate!
Or their sailor shoulder-collar don't wave is how we do things here.
Now, give me your ribbon too.
Not really...
This is the Higashikazuno-use-only church.
I know!
What should we do?
There you are!
What's that?
28 is at Goukou academy?
Yes, of course.
Well, how to say it...
I just kinda started listening.
That's a proof of friendship at this school.
Well...
I didn't know,
Are you saying you won't accept it?
I'm terribly hurt.
SAVE ME!
This has really gotten out of control!
Surround positioning OK.
Ready to fly!
Cotton Candy, Takoyaki, Curry Bread!
Tetsuro-san?
Tetsuro-san?
Did you write them?
Too... much...
Come with me.
Why do I have to wear it?
Burning Blood Team Kino Ranger is here!
No, let's go to the one over there together!
The room's pretty dark, it'll be fine.
I thought as much.
Forged.
But if there are no indication that Celonius moved on their own...
Welcome!
Yayoi's gonna eat herself to death...
Tetsuko-san, how are you feeling?
Yes, I knew.
You've known me for a long time, eh?
The same name as me, Asuka Yayoi.
Right, right, right!
But anyway Yayoi-chan, I'm amazed you found me here.
Wah! You have the same name as me.
We've been waiting for this!
No way, is she telling her how she kissed me!
I'm not either.
A robot?
The ultimate Asuka Yayoi.
It will. I can change it.
It's interesting, even though she's a robot.
What?
You do know what she did?
Hello.
He's wrong.
Everyone who wishes to participate in the folk dance, please head to the front of the school.
I installed her program into Otome's spare body.
She seems like she's having fun.
to fully grown friends,
Boring.
I'm making breakfast.
Hifumi, good morning.
Boring.
Morning.
She's not here?
This is good. Is it Shibadzuke?
I came.
Even if I do go home... it's boring.
We're not sisters.
Well?
Ryouko?
No I don't know her.
More, more intensely ...
Umm... Miya-sama, well...
We have come here to request your aid in helping this poor girl who wandered into the school.
See, look! Her forehead is so big!
What's wrong?
Gantai-chan!
Are you OK?
That's not true.
Liar.
No, really there's no other meaning to it.
I sit on a bench when nobody's around,
Hi-Hifumi?
Kano-sensei cannot correct this. It's best if we get prepared.
Akio. Gantai. We are counting on you.
Hifumi, wait for us!
Hmm? What's the matter, Tetsuro-kun?
No, don't look!
Mandragora mandrake, a magical radish said to be extremely delicious.
That profiteering vermin!
This is the worst, jeez!
Ok, thank you.
Truthfully though, having the panty line show through is really uncool, don't you think?
... and you never listen to what someone is saying all the way to the end.
I seem so stupid for trusting you two.
Hifumi, wait a bit, okay?
Hifumi, you really couldn't have forgotten about Akio, could you?
Forgotten? About who?
What are you saying? We've come this far. Not just for our unit but for Mia-sama also.
My, what exactly is going on here? Acting childish might seem like being a failure?
Hey, Otome. Can you really get in touch with Gantai?
Exactly!
I never once said it would be our school uniform.
You're terrible! Idabashi-san! Why are you doing this?!
Well, I wonder why too?
They'll say Inokai Hifumi is a cosplay loving freak, don't you think?
Hifumi!
Shall we move on to the next set of photos?
This is great!
Even around the fuddy-duddies this pose is...
I don't want it raw!
Positively. In the end, Hifumi is best when she's being Hifumi.
Forgetting? What would that be?
This is so fun!
It's just as you say.
The terms are pretty good.
It's just an hour by car.
I guess so.
Huh...
Huh? Well, yeah...
Well, I heard they do plays here.
i1q2What's the decisive factor that caused us to break up?
You're not used to those boots, are you?
What do you say about holding hands for a bit?
i1Yoji is always like this.
an8What do you mean?
Hey, wait!
an8Come on, let's hurry.
Wow!
an8Apparently it goes way back.
an8What's wrong, Chiaki?
i1I couldn't say them.
Yoji...
Come on, it's just a souvenir.
Thank you for always doing this.
Shiori hasn't even told me, her best friend!
There's a frog here!
It seems that I like...
q2The kokiriko dance originates from traditional dengaku dance, and is a form of harvest dance.
The lyrics were originally improvised.
Isn't this cute?
Aoi, I mean.
So I thought it was best not to tell him.
Maybe it really was better not to tell him.
Pretend you didn't hear anything!
I'm so embarrassed.
Who cares if they hear?
I mean, I...
...less than I expected.
i1for us new to skiing.
Um...
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
q2By the way, when you get on a gondola here, make sure you sit on the ski slope side.
There's something amazing to see there,
Oh right, the vending machine.
Yup. My 130 yen.
Oh, please.
Not at all!
They're more than that to me.
It's amazing how many camellias they have.
I just happened to...
Hang on, I'll wrap up the remaining work real quick.
i1He's a big fan of nature.
i1And not just nature,
This is so great.

Wait!
You're going too fast, Matsuri-chan.
Yakumo's going to be happy.
Hey, come on!
Well? Give up yet?
an8Good morning!
an8I did it because Yuuki showed me something weird.
Impossible!
Oh no!
Good morning, Oojima.
You're here early today.
No, it's a sky-blue thong
Like hell I'll tell you!
Non-chan left the switch on her latest invention,
So what do you think, Yuuki-senpai?
Let us begin with number one, as usual.
The former public safety commissioner who appointed Oosawa as his replacement
was you, Student Council President Mouri.
Forgive my tardiness. I was looking into something.
Th-That's...
and report the settlement.
The manifesto she presented for her election campaign
an8So that's why your nickname is Garage.
an8Indeed.
an8Actually, forget about it.
We could!
If the Food Club's gone,
q3Public safety is a no-go since President Oosawa lost his position from that scandal.
Please lend me, Tatsumi Moheiji, your support in the upcoming election.
Did she drop this?
I agree.
If there's no other candidate, why don't you guys run?
There's no point. Even if we did, we can't possibly win
I will do whatever it takes to protect this place.
Soon,
the election will begin.
Sounds professional.
Why me?!
Don't even try to back out now, Ooshima.
Right? Don't you agree, Morishita-san?
So when the love between you ripens...
It's there. You just have to reach out. Try it!
Oh, it's right there at the top of the list.
He said that he's quitting the Food Club.
Oh, Ayumu-san!
Okay.
Well, that's because...
I picked it up after we bumped into each other.
This is the key to my house.
You came here for this even though it's Sunday?
You should hurry!
Non-chan will die without Yuu-chan!
I set the photo we took together as my wallpaper.
Oh, another one!
Answer me!
It's not Ooshima. It's Oojima!
Excuse me, Oojima-kun, your Food Research Club was on the list of clubs to disband,
You've misunderstood. What I was referring to was...
leaving only two likely candidates.
You have my support.
You're making it sound like we broke up.
I can't really eat it.
Hey, how about working on achievements now so we won't have to disband?
It's unreasonable, to say the least.
And? Are you going to run?
Then here's a question for you.
I'd call them... "the strongest horses," I guess.
The probability of someone who doesn't enter the race not winning is 100.
Oojima's here.
q3as you think about the person who would have the best chance.
Someone that all of us would want to support.
Hooray!
It earned Non-chan's endorsement too!
I-I dug my own grave!
Yeah.
Next time, Episode 3: "Strategy."
Starting today, the club room is our campaign headquarters,
The problem is that we don't have any know-how on campaigning.
Wow! Yakkun long time no see!
Obviously!
Yes. Yakkun was in my class during freshman year.
I am.
from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, already belongs to me.
That's correct.
Our offer to help stems from a selfish reason.
So, if an independent like Yuuki is elected president,
Yes.
The students in clubs that would receive budget cuts are against her now.
they'd be the ones getting those votes.
They would also release their manifesto to attack Shinonome's weaker stands, too.
Then it's another 200 votes...
I don't mind that you're enjoying yourselves,
That being the case, we can't lend you any of our members.
Isn't that fascinating?
Nevertheless, I understand that it's difficult for you to trust me so suddenly.
And if you begin to trust us somewhere down the line, we'll extend the contract.
Morishita-san... right?
It is not necessary for you to place first in the primaries.
He's a pro. An campaign pro.
No one else wants to,
We'll be fighting against people that have the support of
the Finance Commission and the General Affairs Commission.
T-That could pose a problem.
Still, this is a lot to be responsible for.
Chisato, we'll help under one condition.
I don't have time to deal with your foolishness.
I'm not responsible for that. Talk to General Affairs.
I'm a teacher, so I'll support you without letting my private life influence me, too.
an8We're taking a break, right? Get me some coffee.
Jeez... Treat me preciously if I'm your property.
Well, there was this thing with her bike...
There should be some pepper left.
That's something only a person who regularly cooks should say.
She's not my girlfriend.
You're welcome.
Well, see you later, Yuu-kun.
You know how there are both sweet, sugary snacks
like the salty crackers with sugar on top or candies with salt on them.
You're going to be the Student Council President.
You have my support!
Maintenance for the school.
I see.
A-Aomi-san?
Oh, no, never mind.
Thank you very much, Senpai!
What?
Nothing.
q2We'd have 40,000 yen if each of us contributed 5,000 yen.
Why are you still calling me Ooshima even though you can say "Oojima Roll"?
I can't make that many!
Shaking hands and taking pictures wouldn't cost us money!
Notice how all these goods have my name and picture on them?
You heard that?
It doesn't look much like a pamphlet.
Seriously?
Yeah. Okay. Got it.
People might take it the wrong way if they fall off, so we have to stick them on firmly.
It's all settled.
hydraulic suspension-linked, posture control and alignment system-equipped,
He went out to buy ingredients for 20 Oojima Rolls, so he'll take a while.
an8You've got some nerve, picking a fight with the Air Sumo Club!
Wh-What?
Hey, bring salt!
In order to reduce these wasted resources,
I still have work to do.
Reform of the financial aid system?
Sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'm flattered, Yuu-kun,
President, please tell me!bg
an8A favor?
When I transferred to this school after being held back for a year due to surgery,
It was both stressful and painful.
That's awe-Samantha, Tabitha!
And that makes six done.
No. My last name is Oojima.
Lastly, do you have a message for the voters?
That's all for the interview.
You misunderstood me!
Okay. Hang in there.
Yes, I am.
Oh, I almost forgot!
That again?
Don't worry. I'm looking right at her in my own way.
an8Everyone, it's a pleasure to be working with you!
an8But man, we're lucky to have landed a spot right next to the event stage.
We're back!
This looks ridiculous!
Wait, you didn't know?
I need to go over it at least one more time before the speech!
I have the file, so I'll go print another copy.
You can count on me.
All right, guys. Let's do this!
Oojima...
It's 300 yen per slice!
That makes it worth 300 yen?
Starting at 500 yen each!
I came up with the cosplay idea!
He's kind of cute!
What the hell is this?
Anyway, open up!
If I'm not mistaken, your Food Club manifesto
aims to preserve the freedom that club activities currently have.
I see! My policies and your platform are in perfect alignment.
I'd appreciate your support after the primaries.
You should follow the path that you believe in.
Please support me when that time comes.
That bastard...
Good work!
A bag of potato chips has as many calories as a bowl of soba noodles, for instance!
However, you might find yourself at a dead end.
an8The same goes for our garage kits!
an8Kiba-senpai, what's wrong?
an8The speech she wrote is about to be read aloud in public, after all.
You see, everyone, there is a great deal of frivolous spending in the current academy budget.
was there ever a dispute regarding the budget planning?
Yeah, let's do our best.
both the school and student body,it's a 3 liner this should be shortened there isn't any pause in his speech so it'd look awkward to split
Yuu-kun, wait for me!
Lend me your support!
Giving a speech next is Oojima Yuuki, an independent candidate.
My name is Oojima Yuuki!
Otherwise, your vote won't count!
If you have not cast your vote, we ask that you do so promptly.
an8What the hell did I talk about?
You went through so much trouble to get me the script, but I was too nervous to read it over
Oh, we already have candidates projected to qualify!
What?
Well, I tried to give proper answers, but she...
The counting just started.
But...
That means there will be about 60 more updates.
The swing votes will scatter between you and her.
I see.
The minimum pass line is 604 votes, so you only need 33 more votes!
20 of 140 votes, huh?
An update!
Or at least I'd like to.
That fourth person is still getting votes.
Thanks so much, you two!
That's right! Don't let what's to come scare you!
Hooray.
Hooray!
Yes, it was a sabotage attempt by the Katahira Faction.
We've gotta psych ourselves up with the camp tomorrow!
Yep.
Yeah.
an8Thank you!
And these are the votes received by the other two candidates, Shinonome and Tatsumi.
I think there are a lot of people who gave him the vote just for fun, though.
In the end, the Finance and General Affairs Commissions are parts of the Student Council.
In other words, their competition may look like infighting to some people.
This might work pretty well against Shinonome-san.
q0What would happen if you also called yourself a revolutionary and competed against her?
Between a revolution led by a member of the old order
Wh-What are you doing?
Stopping the bleeding.
Oh no, that's my job, too.
Yuu-kun, you take a break, too.
Okay, then. Thank you very much!
Whoa!
Why are you acting so weird?
Well, yeah.
W-Wait a second!
What's your problem with the family?
Oh, you two are pretty close, aren't you?
U-Um...
an8I might not be able to wake up, so I'm counting on you if that happens.
You feel so nice!
Huh?
Hey, let's kiss!
Hold it!
No, I don't know anything about this.
Many of the girls are asleep.
For now, go around and tell everyone to lock their doors.
Where did he go?
You can come out now.
q0Knowing you, I'm sure you have your reasons for being here.
What is it?
You still could've called a girl in the club and avoided this entire mess.
q0I'm starting to believe that the two of you have a special relationship.
Is that strange?
It is!
I see. I get it now, more or less.
You do?
Yes. I understand why you care about her more than a normal student would.
But what should I...
But they're so high in calories.
You're so hard.
Don't you want to?
I mean, I'm so defenseless right now.
It's too much.
Hey, did you find him?
an8Third, play some more shogi and wait a little longer.
Are you sure about that?
But you two kissed, right?
You make the first move this time.
What is it?
Did you ever hear the reason my sister left home?
My sister kept quiet and wouldn't tell me anything.
It seems like my sister is open with you,
Now's your chance.
Could we hang out again sometime?
Well?
Wai
He caused a ruckus and kept a few girls up all night.
What about you, Morishita-san?
Recreation?
Test of courage?
It was developed secretly in the event that it would be needed!
It's the "Freaky, destruction feature-equipped,
Hazuki-sensei?
That one was Aomi-san.
Well, if they're screaming, of course I'd get worried.
I know it was you!
You don't need act that way. You know I won't leave you.
Looks like we caught up to you.
Hey, wait!
an8Then Shinonome-san saved me
an8Sensei.
Did Satsuki ask you to find out?
You never sincerely confessed anything to me.
I was holding back since I'm an adult and should know better.
Please don't talk about my mother.
Sensei...
Pawn to 2F!
Still think you can win?
Silver to 6G.thus taking the piece
It was bad enough for people to say that I might need a blood transfusion.
My mother is Rh negative.
With her body as weak as it was, she eventually succumbed to her illness.
That's the way it has been and always will be.

Daiki, wake up. Come on.
q0From the Finance Commission, we have Shinonome Satsuki,
I'm completely fine.
an8Maybe you've heard of me.
q0Don't blame me just because you didn't notice sooner.
You should analyze your opponent better next time.
Good morning, Sneakyjima-kun.
q0So what's the matter this time? I thought you made up with Sensei.
What are you guys talking about?
q0We were having a conversation concerning private matters.
Huh?
Waking up early was worth it!
Mii-chan!
Onee-chan, that's no fair!
Sure it is!
Chisato?
Th-Thanks.
an8wants your vote.
i1Aomi-san!i0
Stop it! Please!
You got a problem with us?
We saw everything.
They all match with their owners.
One time, a financial aid student in my class
and holds a concurrent post as Student Council President.
What you saw earlier is a rarity.
You flatter me...
assigned by the school.
They can't join clubs, either.
I want to end the discrimination against financial aid students here at Takafuji Academy!
I feel like I'm an executive who was just discharged from prison or something.
while the Food Club is getting shut down?
They shouldn't be forced to disband or cut their budgets!
Not that! I'm talking about adding the financial aid student issue to your manifesto.
q0We need a manifesto that gets as many students as possible to side with us.
So? Do you think he'll side with us?
I'm wondering if he'll listen to me.
We're only cooperating with him to help him get elected.
You should know better than to team up with shady people, Senpai.
The new approval ratings are out!
It's Yuuki we're talking about!
That's an indirect kiss.
No!
By the way, what's the name of the character on this package?
no matter what.
op
an8He had me so worried. I was prepared for the worst!
You promised me.
Please eat it.
Yuuki...
The other half...
an8S-Sorry!
an8I'm so sorry! Did it hurt?
an8I see.
Hey, it's not that big of a deal.
I am a member of the Public Safety Commission.
I understand that.
This was a legitimate deal!
Enough.
However, there's no going back once you hear it.
Less than admirable?
Spies?!
What about the kind of snacks you dislike?
So you're fine with anything edible. Got it.
an8Katahira Faction?
an8One of the conditions for admitting her into the hospital
So you're saying I should have just watched as she died?
The same way you heartlessly refused to eat her chocolate.
You used Daiki-kun as an excuse to hide from your own feelings.
For me, who might lose someone important...
Chocolate?
Yuuki.
Chisato, aren't you in love with Yuu-kun?
Why don't you just ask him out?
I was at the gates of Hell itself.
But then I met you.
If you could see things my way...
Yuuki ate my chocolate.
So it hurts me when you're suffering, too.
Stop...
Mifuyu!
Mifuyu!
That's all I can tell you.
Kana is in Hatsushiba General Hospital! Hurry!
What's the meaning of this?
To give a shot.
It's me. This is urgent.
I wanted to see you.
I was so lonely without you.
an8The debate was a huge success!
an8We're hitting 'em with one last speech before they start punching those ballots!
Huh?
And 100 of people regret eating them after the fact.
op
Huh?
Where's Chisato?
Hello?
We'll return the girl eventually.
Hello?!
Kana-chan?
an8Don't worry about your job right now.
an8Coming in!
Yuu-kun, where are you right now?
I can't get through. I think he turned off his phone.
Oh, no. Look how late it is.
Take care.
What place did we get?
so that I could collect news anywhere.
What the heck
so you decided to sabotage me directly.
What happened to you?
Her friend saw Yuu-kun alone with his clothes all torn up.
Someone must be obstructing him from attending the election.
Please locate those two.
Excuse me.
Your smartphone, Kana?
q3I'll tell you where the girl is once we confirm you're there.
Sumiyoshi-san is being held in the storage vault of the Lock Gate.
The images taken by the camera that night were set to transfer here automatically.
Chisato! Chisato!RIP in peace, Chisato
You belong to more than just me, too!so we can have a threeway
It's too late to give up!
This completes the speeches for all candidates.
You're out of time!
You don't have to listen,
but there's something I've got to say, so...
Huh?
I learned what it takes to win an election.
q3using political strategies, making connections with the right people,
Not once did I hear the word "justice."
q0when I've been elected with votes I won through lies.
I can tell from how you're all listening to me talk to myself without leaving!
It's even more fun to watch this change color!
an8Is this leftovers-on-rice flavor?
an8Oh, really?
But he earned the voters' trust that he'd do his job.
Hey, wait up!
You seriously gotta wake up
What did you say?!
Yuu-kun, I'm flattered,
Impossible!
You should've noticed your feelings for her earlier.
Normal.
Normal.
Right, completely norm
Pink? Chisato, you're wearing pink today?
People's names are important!
the self-sustaining, super high-speed, starch saccharification and solidification device,
Nice one.
About what?
Well, how should I put this?
Let us begin with number one, as usual.
Let's have a taste.
This is white chocolate-flavored.
Don't worry, it's just me being picky.
You don't seem all that sympathetic.
What?
Disbanded?!
That's it?! Take some responsibility!
q3specifically, Public Safety Commissioner Oosawa's exuberant interrogation of the suspect
i1She must have done that before coming here.
Well, these aren't really unaccounted!
an8So that's why your nickname is Garage.
an8They all cost a lot.
She's like, so organized and perfect, you know?
What mask?
Look.
He's not wearing a mask.
Please lend me, Tatsumi Moheiji, your support in the upcoming election.
I have not said anything to that imply that!
It's just a sign of my appreciation.
Ah...
It's either waiting for the Food Club to be disbanded
Non-chan concurs! The Food Club must go on!
I'm in too!
I will do whatever it takes to protect this place.
Well...
I'll take the bottom.
Yeah!
Who's going to run?
Why me?!
Normal.
The club president orders you, Oojima Yuuki!
Congratulations on your marriage!
Yes, of course!
I should be asking you that.
What's your problem?!
We need to prepare for the election too!
There's no way someone like me would get elected
Really, I'm so sorry.
Oh, this!
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you stop him?
Oh, we met yesterday!
You saved me the trouble of replacing the lock.
Do you have a club meeting, too?
I'm Aomi Isara, a first-year.
Stay put!
Understood.
I just have people around me telling me to.
You have my support.
There is little doubt that the Finance Commissioner will
The club will disband if I don't run, huh?
Is there something wrong with my reasoning?
Shinonome-san...
I should get going now. Later.
Oojima's here.
and I decided to fight for the Food Club!
I'm up for it.
When we're actually voting...
I see, I see.
I-I dug my own grave!
Yeah, you're right.
I can see how that came about,
My candidacy form has been filed!
Well? What should I do next?
an8They're the weak candidates.
We need something that can easily attract anyone.
so how about making snacks free?
We don't know anyone like that.
It's been a while, Non-chan.
It's only natural that I'd grow.
Yeah... I guess.
If you're after his body, you're too late.
How did that happen?
...which is 25 votes from each of us?
only if you cooperate with us.
We know that we can't do this on our own.
Don't be ignorant, Yuuki.
The President isn't doing this out of kindness of his heart.
And if you begin to trust us somewhere down the line, we'll extend the contract.
Same here. I look forward to it.
Sure.
I don't know what you're up to,
No one would look at the manifesto of a bubbly candidate.
"Protecting the clubs," right?
A female club member?
He's a pro. An campaign pro.
There must be at least a hundred of those clubs, right?
There you have it.
They're gone.
However, we don't have that kind of support for ourselves.
That's why we need an election committee.
It shouldn't appear as though the committee was forcibly formed.
We're begging you, Ariake, Garage.
Make this part more concise and easier to read.
Are you disbanding the Food Research Club to annoy me?
an8I never thought that talking to strangers could take so much out of you.
Oh, Shinonome-san.
I thought your name started with "P,"
Right. I don't plan on losing, though.
Ayumu-san.
It's so good! I haven't tasted your cooking in two weeks.
Chisato?
It must be hard having a such a jealous girlfriend.
Please don't make jokes like that.
But I still don't get why I did something like that.
I'd be very grateful for that.
Please don't just try to console me. Tell me the truth!
W-Well?
Not at all! In fact...
We need to find funding.
for 6,000 people, it would cost 60,000 yen!
Then you'll have to go with the second option.
Yuu-chan's specialty roll cake that can only be found at the Food club!
Fluffy sponge and fluffy cream in complete harmony!
If we sold it at 100 yen per slice, the profit would be 60 yen each.
Wouldn't it be considered bribery to hand things out for free?
Why don't we hand out the snacks we've stocked up in here?
All the Yaoi Sticks we need.
At least 2,000. If possible, 3,000!
So, Hazuki, mind lending us campaign funds?
She thought this might happen and developed this helper machine, Harihari-kun!
That machine is going to put on the labels for us?
multi-hand massage manipulator!
all of this will take ten hours for one person.
I should've brought Yume with me or something.
an8Hey, hey, hey! What do you mean by "cutting our club funds"?
an8You've got some nerve, picking a fight with the Air Sumo Club!
We've found some suspicious entries in your club expenditures.
but is that much stew a necessity for air sumo?
Curse you!
Never come back again! Go! Go!
How many more?
Have you thoroughly gone through my manifesto?
The club reform isn't solely for budget reduction.
I still have work to do.
Yeah, I don't want to see another Yaoi Stick for a while.
No. Really, I'm fine.
Really.
Were you trying to show off that you know an upperclassman? Huh?
i1I bet you gave him the eye.
Okay! That's all 3,600 Yaoi Stick-pamphlets!
but I'm in love with someone else.
What do you mean?
an8I can afford to skip a few classes,
an8but isn't your attendance at risk of being too low?
They used respectful language and treated me like I was special.
I'm a year older than you, remember?
Excuse me.
Correct my name first.
So that's the most important.
Thank you very much for your time.
"Please support my campaign."
Yeah, I just finished...
That'd be the one loved by everyone, Non-chan!
I'm busy right now, so please come back when I'm done.
I'm lonely!JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST SHE WANTS THE DICK
I don't want you to get distracted.
A financial aid student is assigned to each candidate for errands and the like.
That's...
Right! I'll be giving it my all!
an8It's starting soon!
Takafuji Private Academy's primary election begins now!
So obvious...
I'll be selling figures and garage kits,
Crap, I left the script at home!
What, you haven't memorized it?
Sorry about this. You're a lifesaver, Mii-chan.
Don't forget to vote for Oojima Yuuki!
Oojima...
"Yuuki gently embraced Mifuyu,
It's 300 yen per slice!
I came up with the cosplay idea!
you're up next!
Like this, please!
That looks like you and me.
Guess we have no choice.
Do it!
Yuu-kun!
Here you go.
Oh, I mean, I'm in love with someone else.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
If I'm not mistaken, your Food Club manifesto
Huh?
I entered this race to win.
Please support Oojima Yuuki!bg
There are low calorie snacks that can help!
Next time, Episode 6: Results.
But I don't have the script yet.
an8What am I going to do? What am I going to do?
an8I'm sure you did a perfect job as usual!
I need to get this to Yuu-kun!
Mifuyu?
However, I urge you to consider the following:
was there ever a dispute regarding the budget planning?
He even planted sympathizers in the crowd!
Thank you for you listening.
Please give your vote to the candid candidate, Tatsumi Moheiji.
Huh?
Satsuki!
Hey, you're back.
i1"Yuu-kun, you have someone important to you."
i1"Nothing would please me more than to see you two happy."
I'll have to give the speech while reading from it.
Wait! Wait, Yuu-kun!
Please, let me through!
We can't!
I just have one thing to tell you guys today!
Elect me, and I'll put an end to the club reform measures!
I'm sure you're all in the same boat, so please...
Really?
The webcast of the election special is about to begin.
Good afternoon. I'm your host for this ASP election special, Haratachi.
They're in a different league.
His key policy is "name correction."
Yes. I am at Mr. Oojima's campaign office.
How is the general mood over there?
Why are we getting nervous over a webcast?
Sacchan has such a huge lead!
Tatsumi is in second, unsurprisingly.
If that happens,
I see.
With 94.4 percent of the votes counted,
Ooshima-shi got 608 votes!
All right!
That's right! Don't let what's to come scare you!
Hooray.
It seems she received some of the Public Safety Commission votes.
What's so scary about that?
Same here.
Good job today!
Sure.
Yep.
an8Thank you!
q0First, Oojima-kun received a little over 600 votes in the primaries.
You can easily get those 3,000 votes if you sway the voters.
Sway them?
Yuuki's different in that respect.
We should come up with a really catchy slogan.
Th-Thanks.
Yeah, I will.
Don't worry. You should get going.
Yuuki!
When we were little, yeah. Things are different now.
Well, yeah.
"No reason"?
Tell me.
Then I'm coming in.
What's wrong?
Dummy.
What's your problem with the family?
But I won't let you flirt with other girls.
You already kissed me, after all!
an8You know what to do when someone won't wake up.
Shh!
No, I don't know anything about this.
Many of the girls are asleep.
Okay, we will!
Outlawjima-kun.
You were guilty the moment you stepped into the girls' campsite, with its strict no-men policy.
Huh?
With so many spices and fruits that aren't used in Japanese sweets!
You called?
Please don't give me any unlucky nicknames.
How did he just disappear?
And if it doesn't work out, I'll go with the second one.
She also stopped interacting with the entire family.
q3I asked my parents why, but they weren't of any help.
It still depresses her, even now.
Now's your chance.
Wai
That excuse won't work on me.
So a hand should emerge from inside...
What? Last night?
Really?
You don't need act that way. You know I won't leave you.
Then do you hate your family?
Why did you leave them without
I knew booze was the only thing I could trust.
Now, what's your response?
I'm surprised you agreed to this so easily.
You must still be drunk.
Huh?
Good for you, Satsuki.
You got to be born after they tied the knot.
Knight to 6G, check.
Silver to 6G.thus taking the piece
All right, then... Oh yeah.
One time, I hurt my head, and it left a mark.
Right here. Can you see it?
It was bad enough for people to say that I might need a blood transfusion.
They were worried that there might not be enough blood for a transfusion.
That's just...
I didn't know how to face my own family anymore.
I'm so sorry.
I'll give you my half, too, so wake up.
Get up already, Yuuki.
However,
Are you okay?
an8Maybe you've heard of me.
an8q0No one knows about you because you're not working hard enough.
That was a dirty trick!
and someone might pull the rug out from under your feet.
She tricked me.
That's not what I'm talking about!
What are you guys talking about?
Hurry up before the other students start showing up!
Catch me!
The ASP assigned me to report on you throughout the election!
I'm ready any time!
I have a very special job, just for you two!
We have a very influential ally this year.
an8I'll stop the club reforms!
Don't do anything violent!
They all match with their owners.
We haven't done anything violent!
What's the matter?
The Public Safety Commission?
was taken away by the Public Safety Commission,
It was so bad that she stopped coming to school.
Eventually, it grew too much for her, and she stopped coming to school altogether.
but the Public Safety Commission has never really cracked down on financial aid student harassment.
What you saw earlier is a rarity.
That's not true. You came to help me, and that's more than enough.
You were really cool.
Wasn't the financial aid system
I feel like I'm an executive who was just discharged from prison or something.
q0It must have been so much trouble having to manage two posts while I was away.
Let me hear your story later.
while the Food Club is getting shut down?
We have to win the election!
That means your policy might make that majority turn their backs on you!Chisato knows politics.
Because you want to compete with the Finance Commissioner?Chisato is on pm
Chisato...
Why? Why are you leaving me behind?
We're not drifting apart.
Just kidding!
According to ASP's survey, although it's only by a narrow margin from Shinonome,
Let me see!
Huh?
Like what?
Wait!
Yaoi Sticks taste good.
Normal...
Eat it.
I'll give you chocolate!
I'm not lying!
Eat it.
Wh-Where is everyone?
Not here.
Things are looking pretty good for us!
She gave it to me.
She went missing?
I nearly lost my balance and tripped at the entrance.
That's so...
I'll protect the Takafuji tradition.
an8so I'm here to see an ophthalmologist.
I was in a small car accident.
Where?
I am a member of the Public Safety Commission.
It has nothing to do with me!
Good-bye.
P-President...What the fuck?
We, the Public Safety Commission, maintain security on campus,

in the background, the old boys are holding power struggles of their own.

The President insists on putting Oojima Yuuki on the throne.
an8Katahira Faction?
an8was appointing Oosawa Yuina as Public Safety Commissioner.
It's actually pretty funny.
What'd you say?!
You think I didn't know?
What are you
Stop!
I was at the gates of Hell itself.
If you were elected President...
If you could see things my way...
you talked to me without minding it in the least.
Mifuyu!
Why not?!
I understand.
Right away.
an8We're hitting 'em with one last speech before they start punching those ballots!
an8Wow, maybe you're not cut out to be a presidential candidate.
What?! You can't make it?!
Excuse me, you two!
That's perfect!
We did this before when we were kids.
We have Sumiyoshi Chisato.
Understood?
Otherwise, you'll regret it.
What are you planning to
Hey, wait! Hello?
an8Coming in!
Oosawa-kun!
q0The Student Council President, of all people, can't be late for that!
Can you hear me, Yuu-kun?
Look under the telephone.
This is Chisato's...
q3Things are looking bad. The drawing to decide the speech order will begin soon.
You can trust us, you know.
Oh, I already heard about that.
Sorry, but I have important business to attend to.
The speech will last for thirty minutes from 11:30 to 12:00.
If this keeps up, he'll lose the election!
You're part of the Katahira Faction, aren't you?
What happened to you?
Her friend saw Yuu-kun alone with his clothes all torn up.
Oojima-kun and Sumiyoshi-san are missing,
Excuse me.
The next one will be the last.
So that the election isn't declared null and void due to the incident?
q3If you defy my orders, more people around you will be hurt.
She called me earlier and asked me to check the data in it.
q3We found pictures of a Public Safety Commission member in the Katahira Faction
q3and a General Affairs Commission officer engaging in a backroom deal.
So you were dealing with them all along.
And of course, everything will remain the same.
You're more important to me.
You belong to more than just yourself right now.
But it's too late.
How did you two get up here?!
Thank you for your patience.
Everyone!
Please wait.
Shinonome-san!
Not once did I hear the word "justice."
q0the weaknesses of my rivals than to develop my own policies.
q0when I've been elected with votes I won through lies.
And that's...
I'm sure being a Vice President is a lot of work.
You can't even make a proper rice ball. You definitely can't bake a cake.
So I want to make something for the party!
Hello!
He's already booked for the day!
He and I are making sweets for the party tomorrow! Just the two of us!
he has to cut expenses, secure new sources of revenue, and solve various other problems.
I'm not just a member of your club. I'm also the student council vice president!
Ayu-chan!
So what brings you here today?
I can lend you a hand if you need it.
I will!
Oh, really?
By the way, Sacchin, have these grown even bigger?
S-Stop!
Hey, don't just eyeball it!
Okay, now take the hotcake mix and...
It'll be really hard to mix!
Well...
That depends on how much effort you're willing to put into this.
Yep!
I think I'm... getting the hang of this.
Knead it to death, yay!
Now all that's left is decorating!
If only Onii-chan were here! He could've seen you in this adorable girls' uniform!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
G-Good luck!
Sacchin and her cake will go first!
Let the judging begin!
I bet the other Food Club members will love these cookies, too!
OoshimaI mean,
I never knew this and tried to disband the Food Club for its lack of conspicuous achievements.
Thanks for today.
This layer cake is delicious!
No. I was kinda scared.
Wait!
Judging from the thickness, it's around two million yen.
Cheer up. I'm sure someday you'll find
Good morning, Morishita-san.
You never learn, do you, Ooshima?
Yeah, yeah.
Nice one.
Sure is.
Wow, that looked just like a TV commercial.
Normal.Yeah it's different from the earlier translation. If anyone can get both lines parallel and have neither instance sound odd, then by all means
Yuuki-senpai putting my Yaoi Stick in his mouth.
Wh-What are you doing?
I'm sorry. It slipped my mind.
Don't worry, it's just me being picky.
Let me get a quick drink first.
q3specifically, Public Safety Commissioner Oosawa's exuberant interrogation of the suspect
if the student council president were to resign immediately?
W-Well, I believe the vice president would be acting president until the next election.
The future of the school management is more important than the past!
q3concerns the restructuring of the needlessly ample amount of clubs.
an8I've been meaning to ask you something.
an8dawn pink, coating paper and stamping, flyleaf and weaving, and et cetera.
We could!
And even if she got elected, that doesn't mean she would follow up on her manifesto, right?
Hazuki-sensei, do you know the finance commissioner?
What?
General affairs commission...
..."thing"?retime
Is that what we were talking about yesterday?
Whoa!
Please lend me, Tatsumi Moheiji, your support in the upcoming election.
Ouch...
No, it's not a big deal.
Eh?
Did she drop this?
A candidate who uses dirty tricks is unacceptable!fotc
We'll run against the finance commissioner.
I will do whatever it takes to protect this place.
Well...
are just melted and reshaped chocolate bars?
an8Mifuyu!
an8Good morning.
It doesn't really matter, Ooshima.
Yes, I proudly present these Umachin-brand snacks.the "Yes," is a little before this line appears. Not sure if it matters much to you guys
You're so lucky.
Well, how should I put this?
Ready, go!
Sure is.
Nothing better than a morning round!
Tatsumi Moheiji-kun.
q3specifically, Public Safety Commissioner Oosawa's exuberant interrogation of the suspect
harassment towards financial aid students.
but have yet to fulfill that duty.
Objection!
q3I have a question for the general affairs commissioner.
if the student council president were to resign immediately?
W-Well, I believe the vice president would be acting president until the next election.
q3B-But the public safety commission, with which the president is affiliated,
According to this,
an8So that's why your nickname is Garage.
an8Indeed.
And we just eat them without achieving a single thing.
Hazuki-sensei, do you know the finance commissioner?
The boobs say it all.
q3He definitely isn't handsome, but calling it a "mask" is going too far.
Yuuki!
No, it's not a big deal.
Thank you very much!
Of course!
Sounds professional.
Don't even try to back out now, Ooshima.
Non-chan will support you in every way she can!
I'm here for you too, Yuuki-senpai.
Yeah. You'll understand it when you grow up a little more.
I still don't know.
What's your problem?!
q3Reality is too tough, so I'll settle on finding nice girls in the world of dreams.
I ain't going to no club.
What?!
Huh?
Oh, this!
This is important, so one more time.
Ji-ma, right? I got it.
You know...
You're...
Where did you find it?
I picked it up after we bumped into each other.
Which club?
Who are you?
Forgive us for the violent treatment.
I read the list in Candidate Shinonome's manifesto, and Ooshima-kun...
Excuse me, Oojima-kun, your Food Research Club was on the list of clubs to disband,
There's no way someone like me would get elected.
I suppose that'd be fine, too.
That's mean!
Jeez, what's Yuuki thinking? How could he disobey me, the club president?
You like blueberry flavor?
She went and pressed it.
The club will disband if I don't run, huh?
But I gotta win too.
q3an8You seemed to consider the "jima" part important,
an8You kept bowing the whole time, so I thought it would fit.
Thank you.
I don't think it's unreasonable.
Not you too, Shinonome-san.
How is that a club activity?
They're the horses that entered the derbie.
But I think horses that don't enter derbies never have a shot at winning one.
Yep! It's fair, simple, and reasonable.
and we would laugh and mess around. It was really fun.
So is courage.
Wow, I never thought I'd be moved by a speech from Ooshima.
No grumbling!
That's good.
and I will be acting as Campaign President.
Non-chan is very excited!
Well then, let's get into campaign mode!
an8They have neither popularity nor budget, and their policies are inadequate.
an8Even if they ran, they'd pop like bubbles.
an8You need at least 10 percent of the vote to pass the primaries.
That's 10 percent of 6,000 students,
By...
Non-chan thinks a snack allowance would make everyone happy!
Wow! Yakkun long time no see!
Yeah... I guess.
Let me be frank.
What?
I am.
from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, already belongs to me.
A selfish reason?
Yes.
Once the regime is handed over, it is difficult to get it back.
Yes.
The other day, Shinonome's manifesto was disclosed,
Then it's another 200 votes...
Non-chan can get us lots of votes.
We understand.
What are you saying? We don't have to ask, right?
We don't need to make any rash promises.
It's possible that
We won't let you down.
Sure.
Let's go win!
Yes, me too.
They're all very good kids.
To do that, you should appeal the most salient policy in your campaign.
Well then, can someone else handle obtaining signatures?
President and...
Still, this is a lot to be responsible for.
Are you disbanding the Food Research Club to annoy me?
Oh, how you've grown.
I must surpass you.
Oh, really? If you hate me that much,
At this school, teachers are pretty much hired by the students.
I thought your name started with "P,"
Crap.
No, it's not what it looks like!
Well, there was this thing with her bike...
Yeah, yeah.
S-Stop that!
By the way, what were you doing?
It's fine!
Um, do I really stink?
Not at all! In fact...
That's a relief.
How about covering it with the Food Club's funds?
You can't.
Self-funding, huh?
Oh? It does sound appetizing.
What? You can't?
To raise 30,000 yen...
Shaking hands and taking pictures wouldn't cost us money!
Oh, I've got something.
but I see the general direction of where this could go.
Wouldn't it be considered bribery to hand things out for free?
Yeah, that'd be great, Dad.
All right!
So we're in the clear?
"Harihari-kun" is short for
If it takes ten seconds to affix one label,
We've found some suspicious entries in your club expenditures.
If you intend to practice air sumo, why not eat air sumo stew as well?
She was too much for me to handle!
Normal.
The presidential election and my work are unrelated.
so most of the administrative authorities rest upon the student body.
the academy is severe enough to require so many budget cuts.
Huh?
Oojima-senpai is amazing.
Aomi-san,
are you looking for something?
I'm fine!
Sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Pl-Please stop!
Take some bread crust, deep fry it, and sprinkle on some sugar. It's delicious and cheap!
i1Oojima Yuuki decided to take part in the election.
Yuuki, make sure you get those Oojima Rolls baked by the end of the day.
Thank you, Mifuyu!
Too bad!
Oh no!
an8It's all right.
Need a hand?
so she's able to talk casually with anyone.
That's awe-Samantha, Tabitha!
Um... What?
I don't get it.
So it's Ooshima...
No need to repeat yourself.
How are you holding up, Mii-chan?
i1The two were there, together in peace.
O-Okay! I'll give you the ends, so please don't!
You're giving Non-chan the ends from all 20 rolls?
I'm busy right now, so please come back when I'm done.
Yes! I'll be helping you from now until the end of your campaign!
Takafuji Private Academy's primary election begins now!
So whose goods did you get?
I'll be selling figures and garage kits,
Crap, I left the script at home!
There's no way I could memorize a script that long!
Snakes and crabs, two each.
It was the right choice to have those two sell goods.
It's 500 yen with the photo ticket?
Hey, I could see your underwear!
Coming!
I'm counting on you guys!
Those interested should come to the EAC office located below the stage.
But I don't have the script yet.
Huh?
O-Okay.
Mr. Tatsumi, you're up next.
Are you feeling all right?
an8The speech she wrote is about to be read aloud in public, after all.
an8It'll go great! There's nothing to worry about!
I need to get this to Yuu-kun!
and cut all the frivolities!
Her straightfoward personality makes her words even more convincing.
i1"You have Chisato."
People, you're supposed to laugh!
while others face reorganization and mergers!
an7With the voter turnout at 98.4 percent,
They are the Finance Commission-endorsed candidate, Shinonome Satsuki,
What?
Now reporting live from the Food Club room, Mr. Oojima's campaign office,
There were some smiles before the votes began to be counted,
Sacchan has such a huge lead!
Where her support and votes are coming from is a mystery.
there's no chance you'll win against the other two, who have a secured group of voters, in the actual vote.
With 94.4 percent of the votes counted,
The minimum pass line is 604 votes, so you only need 33 more votes!
Candidate Oojima is projected to pass.
Yes, it would seem they are waiting to see if a fourth candidate will pass the primaries.
You're not just projected! You exceeded the requirment!
Shirakawa Ayame received...
Well, the rumors did say this would happen.
Our future depends on it!
Then why don't we cheer one more time?
Hooray!
Yes, sir!
all have as many calories as 100 grams of sugar.
Next time, Episode 7: Camp!
But we haven't won the election yet!
Hey, Yuuki...
Something really good happened today, so...
Yeah.
an8First and foremost, Oojima-kun, congratulations on qualifying for the real election.
an8Thank you!
"Iron votes"?
And rather dramatically, no less.
Sway them?
Shirakawa Ayame...
I need to really get it out there that I'm not a part of any of the three commissions!
In the end, the Finance and General Affairs Commissions are parts of the Student Council.
He's a complete outsider.
He's the real deal!
Yeah! I hope I can cook with my husband when I get married.
I cut my finger!
S-Stopping bleeding, huh?
Really? I do this for my little brothers all the time.
Huh?
q0I never knew the campgrounds had an open-air bath!
Only because you didn't like it.
Well, I...
Why won't you go?
Because I don't need to go.
Don't talk about your own mother that way!
Sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
an8Man, relax. I was just joking.
It's no use.
Now where should I sleep tonight?
Cheap-ass. Wanna drink together, then?
You don't even have anything left.
You can get back inside on your own, right?
Yuu-kun, where are you touching?
Wait!
Excuse us. A pervert may be hiding somewhere around here.
Did you see anyone?
Then you might want to keep it down.
For now, go around and tell everyone to lock their doors.
What is it?
q0A student normally wouldn't carry a drunk teacher all the way to her room.
Then let me ask you another question.
I see. I get it now, more or less.
q0Then how about you do something for me in return?
Don't you want to?
Just kidding.
Please don't give me any unlucky nicknames.
Wanna go another round?
This is so weird.
It's creepy.
What would my big sister think if she found out?
I told you that it was an accident!
Kissjima-kun!
She just holed up at home one day.
It seems like my sister is open with you,
Of course. I'd love to.
If I were to force myself on you with a kiss,
Um...
Well?
Hey, Yuu-kun, you want some?
Recreation?
It was developed secretly in the event that it would be needed!
What excuse?
The hell is that?
You were so worried about Hazuki and Isara earlier.
Wh-What are you talking about?
But she got so drunk that she passed out, so I took her to her camp dorm.
Did Satsuki ask you to find out?
Now, what's your response?
Come on. Answer me already.
It's hard for me to respond to your feelings so suddenly,
I'm just not loose like you.
She was my father's mistress,
Good for you, Satsuki.
Sh-Shinonome-san...
You're still going?
What about you? Don't run.
Silver to 6G.thus taking the piece
What's going on here?
Of course not!
A story?
It was bad enough for people to say that I might need a blood transfusion.
I got stitches and turned out fine.
q3Th-Then you and Shinonome-san are blood-related and share the same two parents?
had her uterus removed due to an illness.
When my late mother became unable to bear children,
I found out by accident when a drunk relative let it slip.
It was more than just shocking.
What does that make my late mother?
We would have an authentic, blood-related family.
It'd be as though my late mother never existed in the first place.
it would... it would really be like she never mattered.
That goes double for the enemies closest to us.
so the insulin secreted can decrease blood sugar levels too much
I've got your favorite chocolate.
Our campaign for the main election starts today.
an8Maybe you've heard of me.
I have to get along with the voters.
So it's not just because she's a girl?
You don't like it?
Nothing.
That's why I'm angry!
Satsuki and I managed to resolve the bad blood between us.
You're too kind.
Switch on!
Most of the students will see us as they're coming to school.
The ASP assigned me to report on you throughout the election!
Same here. Let's do our best!
an8Please give it back!
Please!
Stop it, Yuuki! You're campaigning!
One time, a financial aid student in my class
Thank you so much for coming to save me earlier.
Gained what?weightfuck buddies
It was easier than dealing with me, since I sympathize with the Katahira faction.
Or is it because Isara is a financial aid student?
Don't leave me behind.
Why are we drifting apart, when we were so close?
He's amiable and enjoys interacting
So he won't be our puppet!
They're likely to slit your throat while you sleep.this isn't very idiomatic I think, but she does the 'cutting head' motion so idk
I'm sure they found Yuu-kun charming.
Um, can I see it?
Yuuki, what are you doing?!
Huh?
It's like...
but strange.
Here!
I'll give you chocolate!
q3I'm so relieved that it wasn't anything serious.
Oh, if it isn't Sacchan.
an8He really needs to take care of himself. The election's in full swing, after all.
Liar.
Liar, liar, liar, liar...
You mentioned how you felt so far away from me.
I feel the same way.
Not as Daiki-kun, but as Oojima Yuuki!
Wh-Where is everyone?
Things are looking pretty good for us!
is pretty personal.
Oojima, you knew how to fix it?
What was that song?
I don't know.
So she's a student here.
Are we clear, Oojima-kun?
I am a member of the Public Safety Commission.
i1Kana...i0
She owns the harmonica that Morishita-san carries around.
What is this about?
However, there's no going back once you hear it.
So we use less than admirable methods.
Spies?!
The other one was...
Would you like me to continue?
Normal.
Kana-san and Morishita-san are spies?!
run by a former member of the Public Safety Commission.
an8How... How can you use that to decide who to appoint to such an important role?!
It's fine. Yuuki won't mind something like that.
I think Yuuki's into you just as much.
I'm sorry.
I have not.
And finally, I have one last thing to say.
Did you want her to search for Kana-san forever?
Find Morishita Michiru immediately.
I looked everywhere for you.
Then what's with these numbers?
What would you like to do?
an8Wow, maybe you're not cut out to be a presidential candidate.
That's perfect!
Yeah.
Together.
Huh?
50 of people surveyed are worried about their diets when they eat sweets,
and the other 50 have given up and just eat them.
op
ed
Kana-san and Morishita-san are spies?!
Chisato...
an8Internal strife.
an8How... How can you use that to decide who to appoint to such an important role?!
This is what went through your head.
If, one day, Sumiyoshi-san came to terms with Daiki-kun's death,
It's actually pretty funny.
Let's get you changed first.
Chocolate?
We will soon lose our position as ruling party.
I was at the gates of Hell itself.
I wanted someone to forgive me.
So much.
When I was suffering and needed help...
How do I look?
I'm so sorry!
But...
we don't need your partnership anymore.
Not about the election, and not about Morishita-san!
an8We're hitting 'em with one last speech before they start punching those ballots!
an8I think I might have a heart attack.
I know this is sudden, but could you two do me a favor?
People were watching back there.
According to a recent poll, 50 of people surveyed like Western sweets,
and the other 50 have given up and just eat them.
Hello?
q3Now come to the phone booth by the Seaside Park entrance by 7:30 A.M. sharp.
Not even after the election is over.
Good morning, Michiru.
Bad news!
What is this?!
Of course not!
Yuu-kun, where are you right now?
Can you hear me, Yuu-kun?
Yes.
There are?
I'll be going back now.
He needs to get here by then, or he's disqualified!
They were able to request more club funds this way.
Dammit!
Did you get into a fight or something?
It's nothing.
Yeah, should you even be here right now?
q0And there's only one candidate who can make that happen!
Oojima-kun and Sumiyoshi-san are missing,
You won't be able to track them down with GPS!
Do you have my smartphone?
Oosawa Yuina, pattern black. Be careful.
Hey, are you listening, Oojima Yuuki?
You're too much of a perfectionist.
You're more important to me.
Well, I'm not!
But... I came here for you...
Sorry for being late!
Yuu-kun!
I repeat...
q3I'd regret seeing a potential topic for debate left out due to a time constraint.
And that's...
q0So, to stop all those conflicts, to see everyone join hands, I decided to hang in there and win.
That's enough for me.
q3I'm so busy fixing the holes in the President's sloppy policies.
Did you get to talk to Daiki-kun?
Me, too. I told him everything.
Yuuki.
Hm?
This chocolate is delicious.
Hey, hold on!
Kana-chan?
an8Oh, I almost forgot.
Did you approach us to write this article?
Yuu-kun, where are you right now?
An awful rumor is being spread online.
Yeah, I bet.
Will you tell me?
q3I mean, they were actually saved on the memory card,
If this keeps up, he'll lose the election!
If Oojima-senpai never shows up...
See you.
Someone must be obstructing him from attending the election.
Their cell phones are turned off!
You won't be able to track them down with GPS!
However, he has yet to arrive.
The campus was kept safe the entire time, wasn't it?
Chisato! Chisato!RIP in peace, Chisato
But... I came here for you...
You belong to more than just yourself right now.
You have to believe in yourself!
Don't concern yourself with that.
Yuu-kun!
You're out of time!
Please give me just a little bit of time!
No! You'll be disqualified!
Please wait.
Shinonome-san!
q3I'd regret seeing a potential topic for debate left out due to a time constraint.
Don't you feel the same way, Mr. Tatsumi?
Give him time.
q3was in a partnership with President Mouri of the Public Safety Commission!
I only figured out how an election worked after I entered the race.
an8Is this leftovers-on-rice flavor?
an8Normal...
q0an8It was a very unusual approach to an election campaign.
Me, too. I told him everything.
This chocolate is delicious.
I'm off.
Hello, thank you for call
I'm very busy.
Um, I'd like a ride in Alicia-san's gondola please.
I know. From now on, I'm your friend.
Stuff like that.
It's inconvenient.
and I even have to maintain this gondola.
Uh, no...
So she's a freeloader?
But after coming all this way, I was hoping she'd go home liking Neo-Venezia.
This city is made of miracles, isn't it?
Ah!
Not really.
Yeah!
It tasted really good!
All right then, I'm taking us out!
A little to the left!
...but I couldn't.
They were discovering all the little ways that they irritated each other on that trip.
I thought it was this way, but...
I'm lost...
Hello? Excuse me!
I saw your gondola on the beach, so I figured I'd head this way.
I wonder who's behind all this.
All right! Everyone, forward!
Neo-Venezia doesn't have any places like this, does it!
No sappy lines allowed!
And then much more where that came from!
I understand. Also, my name is Alice.
Is Athena-san your instructor, Alice-chan?
First, change into your swimsuits!
That was to exercise your hips and legs!
It doesn't have to be all training! I want to play too!
This place isn't Neverland. It feels more like Never Give Up Land!
This... is... really... hard!
Aika! No clumsiness allowed either!
You're not making any headway at all!
Aika, what happened to your smile?
Behold, the willpower of a single of a Single!
Did you see that?
Right!
Maybe it's about time we show them what the pros can do?
How do I put it?
And now, you're going to say something sappy.
I'm pre-forbidding it.
My, my, thank you.
I hope it really feels like the ocean of Neverland to you, Akari-chan.
I'll enjoy the ocean as much as I can!
I thought our special training was finished!
The Neo-Adriatic Sea has a lot of islands.
That's why there are still so many wonderful little undiscovered places to find.
Yeah!
Well then, shall we jump together?
My skin's rough and my body's aching.
hThis has happened once before. When was it...?
It was when I went to the pool with my family.
Oh yeah, mum said she'd buy me a new one.
Isn't it ready yet?
All right! It's just about ready!
Would you like some corn?
It's the best!
Yeah. That's a good way to put it.
Maybe this island really is Neverland.
Not with sadness, but with the feeling that everything was just so wonderful.
Subtle acts of kindness aren't always easy to spot.
Did something happen?
I've noticed lately just how clumsy my left hand is.
And, um... that's a problem somehow?
It's dead weight for the right hand to carry.
Not only that, it acts like that's the natural thing in the world,
I found her abandoned three days ago.
Oh, and this is Aria, our President.
There's no ketchup.
Athena-senpai, you poured all the gomme syrup into your drink again, didn't you?
She forgets the most important details.
Neither of them are bothered by it at all.
You need some help, don't you?
Oh?
Maa-kun, dinnertime.
Yes?
And Maa-kun reminds me so much of him.
Punishment.
Maa-kun?
Maa-kun!
Maybe Athena-senpai found her and told the company?
What?
Maa-kun!
Not only that...
Whenever I couldn't sleep, you always sang...
Akari-san, about the buttered baked potato.
I just left it in the kitchen, and before I knew it, my dad had eaten it.
Huh?!Eh?!
Are you sure this is okay, Alice-chan?
This is my room.
Mr. President!
Athena-senpai, didn't I ask you to knock before coming in?
Ah, that startled me!
OhEh? What's wrong?
Yes?
Wouldn't it be best to tell Athena-senpai about Maa-kun being here?
It was lucky Athena-senpai started singing like that.
...and they accomplished so much in that time.
Maa-kun!
Maa-kun!
Where could Maa-kun have gone?
That couldn't be. There's no use in assuming the worst.
Athena-senpai knew about Maa-kun.
Athena-senpai...
Maa-kun looks relieved.
Wait, were you singing just now to try and find Maa-kun?
Whenever I couldn't sleep, you always sang...
This little one is now Orange Planet's new president.
Isn't that great news, Alice-chan?
I'm going start a campaign right now, to start thanking the left hand more.
Next time, Doing That Wonderful Job...
Have a good trip. Take care.
No, you are Sideburns,
as long as you have those sideburns.
It's a new world!
She's booked solid. I'm sorry.
If only I was qualified.
Uh, um...
Yeah, I guess.
Um... Well...
Right...
You can't get that feeling on Manhome, right?
Is this an interrogation?
So she's a freeloader?
C'mon, hurry up and get off.
Which one of us? That'd be me.
Then would you row, please?
Oh.
Besides, a freeloader shouldn't get that much service.
This city is made of miracles, isn't it?
A wonderful miracle.
HuhEh?!
Yeah!
He's gone.
We have to hurry!
That was so cool!
She's, um...
Well then, I hope I can be your friend too!
Well, see you later, Ai-chan.
You see, before I came here, I hated Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
Maybe she was just trying to tell you about Aqua.
Maybe hate turning into love is a miracle too.
Is there any way we can make this up to you?
hurry up and become a professional Undine, okay?
Ah! I'll do my best.
Alicia-san, today was a wonderful day!
No sappy lines allowed!
President Aria.
When you hear all these little sounds,
it really feels like the day's getting started, doesn't it?
Please take care of things, Akari-chan.
Twenty months have flown by since the day I first arrived on Aqua.
My second summer is just around the corner!
Um, so this is something I thought up to practice how to row without rocking the gondola.
It doesn't seem like it. They're kinda slow.
How do you like Neo-Venezia?
Still, it makes me happy to know I can do all that on my own.
She just came from Manhome
Miracles?
Yeah. On a world without water or air,
A wonderful miracle.
The potato's so big.
Oh, you think so? Thank you.
Mr. President? We're leaving.
Shouldn't the one who's better do the rowing?
All right then, I'm taking us out!
Akari learned to row backwards on Manhome by mistake.
A little to the left!
She's, um...
My, my!
Well, see you later, Ai-chan.
After she came back from her trip, all she talked about were stories from Aqua.
I can't say I really blame you.
I thought I might like it if I came here myself, so I asked my mom and dad.Extra lead in works with visuals, though down to personal preference.
I'm sorry.
After all, don't you want to talk about the things you like?
I was just thinking, about how much I want to tell my sister about today.
That's what you mean, right?
No, I didn't mind at all! It was a lot of fun for me too!
Really? I promise I really will!
Because the next time I come here,
Heh, heh.Ehehe
Wha...?
Alicia-san! Alicia-san! We've got a problem!
Uh-huh? You're not surprised?
Akari-chan?
Whoa...
Hm, now what?
Okay, pop quiz!
Here you go.
Thank you.
You can exercise or practice your singing.
Right...
At least Alicia-san wouldn't yell at me without letting me explain!
Why should I? I didn't do anything wrong.
Shouldn't you go too?
You're quite the cook, aren't you, Aika-chan?
On one side Akira-chan can be a bit strict, but the truth is she's actually really kind.A keyframe snap works with visuals but to be safe.
I ran away like I did today, but I had no place to go.
Swap with me, Akari!
I'm serious.
Yikes!
Quiet! Knock it off!
you went and got promoted to Prima before me!
My, my!
My, my! Hee-hee!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
That's what she said.
Okay, go!
Aika-chan, wait.
What?
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
She idolizes you so much that she might really try to win.
Huh?
What with all those naps you take.
I think I'll probably be back by nightfall.
I'm off.
Well then, let's go!
Whoa...
splishity-splash!
Splish, splash,
Oh, Akira-san!
You think her coddling would help an amateur like you become a professional Undine?
We can practice together! We'll do Hindu squats!
Sorry for the wait.
Hey! Quit shoveling your food down! It's bad manners!
Huh?
they're called the Three Great Water Fairies, but you never see them all together, do you?
Really?
I ran away like I did today, but I had no place to go.
I'm afraid it's soaked.
There, all done!
She's here 'cause this is Aria Company!
No hee-hee-hee's allowed either!
My, my. Hee-hee!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
My, my! Hee-hee!
If Aika loses, she goes home without another word.Keyframe snap can work here to go with visuals
Didn't I say that wasn't allowed?
All the staff are so formal, calling me Miss and all that.
She idolizes you so much that she might really try to win.
We quit the race.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together!
So then, my mum said, No matter what you're doing, you take too long to do it.
Thank you for asking for me by name.
C'mon!
They're adorable! I definitely want them to come with us!
From my left, they're Undines from Orange Planet, Aria Company, and Himeya Company.
Would you like to see an opera as a momento of your trip?
In a streetcar on Manhome.
I see.
Neo-Venezia is filled with many inconspicuous yet wonderful things which soothe the spirit.
Perhaps it's like your husband, in a way.
I'm terribly sorry, but I have to give these girls on-site training this afternoon.
Hang on a second! Why should we?
Which will be nothing but boring!
Akari Mizunashi, moving out!
Please do your best!
Akari?
Now then, sir and madam, please look to your right.
This building is a replica of the home of Marco Polo.
You keep going to fast.
Next.
Alicia-san!
Eh?No, no. It's just because she was on the front cover of that magazine.
The photo of Alicia-san on the cover... Anyone who sees it would stare at it!
UhAh, Aika-chan, it doesn't look like we can get through this way either.
Yeah.
President Aria's gonna eat it all!
Aren't you mad?
And before you know it, they begin to glow within you.
We're both great Singles now!
Fourteen.
There's no way I'm going to let her beat us now!
Can you take us around?
Welcome to Orange Planet!
Is this your first time in Neo-Venezia?
She's the girl that Orange Planet scouted from the middle school's gondola club.
Anna, we're going!
Smile?
Do you have the day off from your job as a Salamander?
Oh, is that what this is?
Alice-chan, why don't you come too?
Please turn to your right.
Oh, thanks!
But they're not sideburns...
Right, right.
Okay, but it's something I kinda specialize in.
Yes?
Using the water as best you can.
I'm glad we made it in time.
We still have a bit of time before the last ride down."some time" reads like "sometime"
I'll join you.
Since I just got some money, it's my treat.
It really is.
It would probably feel niceh to become one with the wind.
and before I know it, I'm dripping with sweat
Quiet, you.
Whaat?!
I'm Alice from Orange Planet.
then I'd spread this scent all over Neo-Venezia.
They're gonna hold onto it too.
Hey, Aika-chan, Aika-chan?
OhAh, good morning.
Can you take us around?
The new issue's out, huh?
Um, Alice-san?
Have you forgotten? He was my first customer.
But I can't take any customers without an instructor on board!
Um, Akatsuki-san?
Sideburns was only about to show me around.
You're becoming quite good at this, Sideburns.
But they're not sideburns...
Truly, we are guardian angels, the embodiment of justice!
It must be hard balancing all this with school-work.
The best way to kill time at times like this is to people-watch!
RReally?
Okay, but it's something I kinda specialize in.
Akatsuki-san's older brother?
Still, I'm amazed a guy as short-tempered as you could wait this long for me!
Looks like you're a fine Undine on the land as well, miss.
brought the cultures of many nations with them, and founded various cities...
Don't fight the current.
We still have a bit of time before the last ride down."some time" reads like "sometime"
Just say thanks and eat.
It's amazing.
Why are you so happy?
Let's spend a wonderful moment together!
That's really cool.
Woody-san, are you done with work for the day?
No sappy lines allowed!
Sure.
Are you okay?
That's one of the wonderful things about this city.
I'll look into it when I get back to the post office.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Huh? No, I'm fine.
Yeah. No luck unfortunately.
What does that mean?
One of them had the same name that's written on the letter.
I did find the general location where it was.
no matter how many hours it takes.
I just know there's someone out there waiting for this letter.
Is your water bottle filled?
You okay, Akari-chan?
It really is a long way away, isn't it?
UmAh, not really, no.Alt: "Um, that's not it."
I just think that's kind of wonderful.
and it became a lost letter when its destination was lost as well.
Oh. Coming!
It's the same name.
And the year he died is the same as the cancel stamp on the letter.
If I only I could...
I'm glad.
Aika-chan, Alice-chan, let's go on an adventure!
That's the job of the postmen and Sylphs.
Wha? Are you two just teasing me?
Woody-san, are you done with work for the day?
See you around!
Yes?
President Aria!
But the name and address are too smudged that I can't read it.
Oh, there's a data card inside.
Is it really that old?
I want it delivered so badly.
Yeah. No luck unfortunately.
A pioneer base?
One of them had the same name that's written on the letter.
I did find the general location where it was.
But it's not somewhere you can get to in a gondola.
But since I promised, I have to go,
Anyway, I'm sorry about this, Alicia-san.
Yeah, I have it.
Fish?
I'm sure saury and mackerel feel like this when they swim too!
Accidents like that happened all the time.
If that's true, the person it's addressed to is...
Oh. Coming!
It's the same name.
Let's deliver that letter, then.Alt: Let's deliver it thenthe letter.
Even though there are a lot of tough times right now,
And also
But that's impossible.
Ai-chan, after we got back to Neo-Venezia, I tried to find that canal again,
Aw, are you leaving me behind?
Hello.
HuhEh? What do you mean, hello?
so I figured it was one of my seniors at the company playing a trick on me.
I was hoping to sip a glass of iced tea on a seaside terrace!
No one's ever held a grudge against me, unlike you.
Of course.
Wait up!
The beach so bright, it really is sparkling!
But, doesn't running barefoot on the sand, somehow, feel sort of nice.
Got it? Don't be scared of falling in the water!
This is... really hard!
Aika, what happened to your smile?
Did you see that?
We're going to show you how it's done now.
I wish we were that good.
What does?
I'm pre-forbidding it.
At least, that's what Alicia says.
That's why there are still so many wonderful little undiscovered places to find.
HuhEh?
Has anyone seen Alice?
Let's go, Akari!
The waves sound so peaceful, don't they?
That's right. And so we stopped looking for it.
I wonder what happened to the other ribbon in that pair?
Who are you saying cooks like a man?!
My, my, my, my.
Where could anyone ever find a more ladylike lady than you?
You're really sexy dynamite!
Can't sleep?
The sea helped me to remember.
That might be true.
You'd never think this landscape was created by people.
It's an unreal world.
Handling an oar is really more important than singing!
Wondrous things.
But before you know it, that certainty turns into a wish that they be real.
You still really seem to have a lot of faith in them, Akari-senpai.
They lured us out here in the hopes of showing us our dreams, and then crushing them.
No one's ever held a grudge against me, unlike you.
Of course.
I knew it!
Then more after that!BD: "Then more training after that." Not enough onscreen time.
Akari-chan, you don't have to be so tense.
But I want to turn professional as soon as I can!
Quite.
This place isn't Neverland. It feels more like Never Give Up Land!
Got it? Don't be scared of falling in the water!
Akari, no slouching allowed!
My legs... no, my whole body is stiff.
I've got blisters all over my hands... poor me.
Good question. For the afternoon...
It's the best!
My, my!
It almost feels like a paradise, doesn't it?
No sappy lines allowed!
But still...
Hm?
What?
Isn't it ready yet?
You're really sexy dynamite!
We forget so much in our lives. It's sorta sad.
Yeah. That's a good way to put it.
The sea helped me to remember.
You'd never think this landscape was created by people.
What is it?
Huh?!Eh?!
Since Aika-chan's on a company vacation, today it's just Alice-chan and myself training.
Huh?
Huh?Eh?
The problem is that they don't allow pets.
This is my room.
Oh, so this is the Athena-senpai I've heard so much about!
OhAh, there it is.
Athena-senpai, you poured all the gomme syrup into your drink again, didn't you?
Neither of them are bothered by it at all.
Mr. President, we're back.
Oh, Senpai, would you be able to take your bath first, please?
Say, Alice-chan.
No, not at all.
Yeah.
My name's Alice Carroll, and
Maa-kun?
Maa-kun!
Where could Maa-kun have gone?
Alice-chan!
We opened the closet.
Not only that,
That's because, songs are made for others to hear.
Akari-san, about the buttered baked potato.
Not bad. Looking forward to your next try. he said.
I wanted to make something yummy for my mom and dad to eat.
Won't you?
Left hand campaign?
This is my roommate, Athena-senpai.
Oh, and this is Aria, our President.
Huh? Say, Alice-chan.
Huh?!Ehhhhh?!
I think we should be okay for now.
Wow, it's like a stylish restaurant.
There's no ketchup.
She'll trip on a surface that's totally flat.
Oh, Athena-senpai?
Oh?
It wouldn't matter. They can't change the rules, even for her.
Maa-kun is crying.
Thank goodness.
Alice-chan?
We heard a cat crying in your room.
Wait, were you singing just now to try and find Maa-kun?
Athena-senpai.
But still, thanks to that, I stopped feeling so bad and felt warm inside.
It's really exciting, isn't it!
Next time, Doing That Wonderful Job...
Even as a pro, entertaining tourists is a lot of work, isn't it?h
Akari-san, listen to this.
an8Sorry.
Understand? When your passengers board, have them get on one at a time, slowly.
All right!
Extremely popular with female customers.
Incidentally, that is President Hime of Himeya Company.
And this is President Maa of Orange Planet.
Oh, I see.
Sir, how about enjoying Neo-Venezia with your own eyes for a bit?
In a streetcar on Manhome.
Gondola, coming through!
Um...
Huh?!
In the role of customers.
Because this way we get to see the Undines being trained firsthand!
To be an Undine, you just paddle a boat and act nice. Anyone could do it!
All right! All right!
Akari-chan, hey!
hhUm, well, I was just really happy to see him...
Well, there's more where that came from.
Aika! I've told you time and again.
Gondola, coming through.
Wait, you mean Alicia-san of the Three Great Water Fairies?
What did you come out here for, Alicia?
Here you go.
anyone who sees it would stare at it!
As the tide comes in, the water level rises,
Any mistake you make, you have to follow up on.
I wonder if we'll just have to wait for the water level to go down.
When will the tide start to recede?
It seems to flowing to the other side of that door.
I'm worrying enough for all of us.
We did it!
Thank goodness! Thank goodness!
HuhEh?
Yeah.Alt: "That's right"
It's true that Akira-san is strict,
but as often as she gets mad, she also acknowledges when you do well.
I hear it all the time. Becoming a pro takes strict training!
Aika-chan, you should be grateful to Akira-san for training you so hard, then.
Akari-san, listen to this.
an8Sorry.
an8Okay, now that everyone's here, let's begin your combined training.
I'm sorry.
Wow, so lucky!
Yes, and we decided we just had to come here to Aqua for it!
It means phoenix.
Neo-Venezia is filled with many inconspicuous yet wonderful things which soothe the spirit.
We'll join in the training too!
So you think sculling and being pleasant are simple things anyone could do?
I'm kind of scared.
Please do your best!
This building is a replica of the home of Marco Polo.
Next.
Looks like Undines have it pretty rough.
Yeah, your rowing is pretty good.
Alicia-san!
No, no. It's just because she was on the front cover of that magazine.
Yes!
That way's really a dead end too!
Whwhwhwhat'll we do?
Don't tell them that! Why don't you show them what to do?
President Maa.
I wonder if we'll just have to wait for the water level to go down.
Going that way.
It seems to flowing to the other side of that door.
And, pull!
It's pitch black.
You think a gondola can get through here?
Whoops.
We made it out!
Thank goodness.
Don't say I'm a crybaby! Honestly!
President Aria's gonna eat it all!
There's no point in scolding people who try their best and reflect on what they do.
Now forget about it and eat already!
Speaking of President Aria...
Mr. President, are you at it again?
If you want a boxed lunch, I've got one right here!
but I slow getting ready and got there late.
Oh, well...
This is President Aria of Aria Company.
Yes.
Brilliant, as expected.
He had a seat because he got on at the first station,
Um.
We'll join in the training too!
That's how she always is. The nice version only shows up when she's working.
Please do your best!
hhUmEh... Well... I was just really happy to see him...
OyEnough!!
Now then, sir and madam, please look to your right.
Yeah, your rowing is pretty good.
Gondola, coming through.
My, my!
I suppose that's fine.
Hey Mr. Bridegroom, what are you doing staring at another woman?
Don't tell them that! Why don't you show them what to do?
I'm not sure how good of an idea it is, but...
Have we failed?
I wonder if we'll just have to wait for the water level to go down.
Akari-senpai. Aika-senpai.
Okay!
Akari, let's go!
Here we go.
Oh? Aika-chan you're a crybaby!
Yeah.
Basically, you've all reflected on this already, haven't you?
My, my, my.
Look at this, Akari-chan.
Oh, you're so cute!
He must have been so scared.
It's okay now.
What's this?
My, my, my!
to spread the happy atmosphere of Aria Company all the way here to me.
It'd be nice if heroes like that were real, wouldn't it, President Aria?
Little girl! You dropped this!
Hey!
Sure! By all means!
OhEh? DoCould it be you want to help me?
There's a circus class nearby that I'm participating in,
Are you okay? President Aria?
President Aria, you're amazing.
there's a bit of break from the usual workload.
Please don't look for me.
Oh, you're so cute!
Your right.
Whaa?!
My, my, my.
It's okay now.
A revised version of President Aria's special stew.
My, my, my!
OhAh, President Aria!
There's a circus class nearby that I'm participating in,
You can't let that cat show you up!
Next time, That Starlike Fairy...
President Aria?
Sorry! I'll be more careful from now on.
Please don't look for me.
Ribbit?
Hey, look over there!
President Aria!
My, my, my.
A revised version of President Aria's special stew.
Hey!
Are you okay, President Aria?
OhWhoa or Hey, what's with this cat?
Ken-kun came back!
Yay!
Thank goodness!
Do you feel sick or something?
And someday, even the legendary Great Water Fairy herself!
I've heard that she was so perfect at everything, that no other Undine has ever compared.
And after she retired, that great person became the mother to all of this era's Undines.
So I'm on a short break.
Hm, let's see...
The fact that she founded Aria Company,
So this person is the legendary Great Water Fairy.
but we have to become good Primas as fast as we can!
All right! I'm gonna get more too!
Huh? Lots?
I'll just boil these later, okay?
Please do!
It's just like handling a customer's belongings carefully!
Aika-chan, look, look!
Grandma.
I tried to warn you!
I thought we came here for training...Alt: We were supposed to come here for training
Wow, it looks delicious!
Now then, you three, follow Grandma.
There's so much I want to ask.
Glad you liked it!
Huh?
You'll sleep well tonight.
Good night, Grandma!
Uh. Good night...
That's... all there is to it?
Yep, that's it.
Honestly praising yourself when you try hard.
What you see, hear, and touch...
Oh!Ah A shooting star!
If that's your dream, does that mean it's okay if people don't admire you now?
Wha?!
Even if no one looks up to you now, I'm sure one day
Yeah!
she was the one who reigned at the top of Aqua's water guide industry for more than 30 years.
She's known as Grandmother, and is honoured as the legendary Great Water Fairy!
that legendary Great Water Fairy was the founderestablished of Aria Company.
That's common knowledge in the water guide industry.
OhAh...
I didn't.
The only melancholic one here is Aika-senpai.
We're going to meet Grandma soon, aren't we? I can't wait!
According to this, this village was based on Manhome's countryside.
Welcome, young Undine girls.
Alicia told me you were coming.
Pleased to meet you, venerable Grandmother.
It's okay, it's okay.
I seeOkay, then.
Huh?
Right, right.Alt: "Sure thing" The second "" sounds wierd. But it isn't Alice either.
That's really danger
It smells great!
Eat as much as you like!
It's a bath heated by firewoodBD: "It's a wood-burning bath!" Of course, because everyone has a bath just for burning wood in it..
What if we just end up playing around?
Yeah! That was a great bath.
Good night, Grandma!
but this has turned out to be a vacation where we just fool around.
It's all your fault, all you!
This is the first time I've seen such a starry night sky since I came to Aqua.
Yep, that's it.
Oh!Ah A shooting star!
AwEh, it's gone...
Someday, I'd like to be as wonderful a lady as she is.
Akari, let's go to a hot spring! A hot spring!
Akari-san, is it nearly winter on Aqua?
You aren't good in cold weather either, are you, Akari-san?
Gotta get up.
You're lucky you're a Pair. What with both hands covered and warm.
Alicia-san, I'm back!
Snowbug?
Wow!
My, my, my!
Oh, so now do you appreciate all that I do for you?
All right! I may be busy, but I'll do my best this winter too!
It warms your very heart and soul.BD: "It warms you right to the core of your body."
Oh! That'll be so much fun!
What do you think I should bring to a hot spring?
OhAh, Mailman-san!
Oh!
Some of the houses have started using their fireplaces.
Well, I'd best be getting home.
Cozy, isn't it?
My, my!
Let's make a hat and scarf for President Aria.
Not at all! I just happened to know a really nice hot spring!
This way, please.
Here's yours, Akari-chan.
Wait!
Yeah.
but the old couple who owned it had good taste.
There's even more back here.
Why don't you join us?
Wow, look how late it is.
Usually, we would have finished work and have started dinner by now.
My heart's really pounding.
A hot spring in the sea.
Here we go!
Akari, say your prayers!
That was really relaxing, huh?
Take that!
Not bad!
I have to challenge you too!
Akari-chan, Aquan snowbugs live a very long time.
When we're Primas, we're going to go our separate ways.
It's a big bath, like the size of a pool.
Wait, everyone?
It must be a pain to scull a gondola at this time of the year.
Be careful you don't catch a cold!
Yep, it's cold.
Get moving again and your body will warm up fast.
Alicia-san, I'm back!
All right, I'm gonna gather lots!
Yes, they seem to appear out of nowhere when winter comes.
SureHuh...
Let's buy a little more food than usual.
Yeah...
A hot spring...
That's right. I've only ever seen them in holograms.
Do you mean it?!
Oh! That'll be so much fun!
Hey.
Oh!
Look at the chimneys!
OhEh? You think I can do it?
I'll try my best to keep up with you, Alicia-san!
Just as we hoped for.
HmOh? What's wrong, Akari?
No clumsy slowpokes allowed.
Oh! A connoisseur!
And Alicia-san's here with me instead of my loudmouthed mentor!
Hello there.Literally this is obviously 'good morning' but it's late at night. Idea to translate is more like: "hello there sleepyhead" but Alicia would never say that. Alt: "Had a nice nap?" But it's clearly not a question either.
but with this cute snowbug,
Hot springs are like warm gifts from the heart of Aqua, aren't they?
I'm going into the bath again.
This way.
Amazing!
Yeah but, it's a waste to not swim in so much water!
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep again.
This is almost like a dream.
That was really relaxing, huh?
Athena-senpai.
Next time, Those Orange Days...
You know, when I'm curious about something, I can't even swallow my food right!
No, never mind.
On a day like this, I expect those silver angels to appear again.
I can't believe how cold it is today!
Want to run a round trip marathon to the Piazza San Marco? That'll warm you up.
Yay! Alicia-san's special cocoa!
OhEh? Is that sort of weird?
Definitely!
What's this, what's this, what's this?!Italics??
so there were no other apprentices there when I joined.
My, my, my, my.
By the way, I know this might be an awkward question,
If you know anything about that...
You shouldn't lie down right after eating.
Gradually, it just became normal for the three of us to do group training.
OyEnough!
You're the Single everyone's talking about!
Yeah.
We shouldn't say the old days were fun.
I wasn't talking to you.
It'll be fine.
Nighty-night!
The things that change are important.
I'm curious now.
This time we call now is really...
It is really freezing.
Neither of these two have ever managed to organize an event without me.
Are we not supposed to?
so there were no other apprentices there when I joined.
Like in your arms.
Gradually, it just became normal for the three of us to do group training.
Amazing! Akira-chan, you were wonderful!Alt: Amazing! Just as expected from you, Akira-chan
All right! For today's practice, let's try some canzone.
Okay! Then why don't you show us how it's done, Akira?
You okay? Cat got your tongue, Athena?
Give it your best!
I can't remember the last time I got to drink Alicia's cocoa with fresh cream like this.
No... sappy lines...
I'll have more cream in mine, please.
To think, the Three Great Water Fairies were just like us when they started.
But they hardly ever get together now.
Akari, this far is fine.
Good night.
They probably talked like this when they were Singles too.
Don't you think so too, Ai-chan?
This is Aqua, isn't it?
We just finished shovelling off the snow, and now more will pile up again.
I have.
Maybe what others see as just an old bridge,
It really is an old bridge, isn't it?
What's wrong?
I take it you only just came to Aqua?
Um, is Pete-san the...?
Yes?
HuhEhh?!
Say, it looks like it's warmed up outside.
I have my tea out here on warm days.
Those who wish to refresh their souls are hhespecially welcome! Does that sound good?
OhEhh?
I knew an amateur like me shouldn't have tried this!
I'm so sorry!
Um, meaning the other is...?
Uh, no problem.
It's the surest way of getting a message to someplace far away, you know.
Ukijima's shape is sort of different too.
That's right.
Bakeries with tasty bread, little cafs.
Take care, Akiko-san.
It's the perfect chance for some major house cleaning here at Aria Company!
Could you please move for a moment?
President Aria?
Ribbit, ribbit.
Ribbit.
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
Mummy, Daddy! This kitty's so cute!
I hope the weather tomorrow is just as nice.
What's this?
OhEh?
President Aria is reading it again. That Nyan Nyan Puu picture book.
Take it to her?
What are you doing dressed in that weird getup, President Aria?
I wonder who brought him back.
Mummy, I don't care if he's dirty,
Hurry up, you two, or you'll get left behind.
My, my!
None of my customers have wanted to go there.
There used to be people nostalgic for the past who would visit it,
but no one goes there anymore.
Because really, it's just an ordinary bridge with nothing special about it.
Why not go?
President Aria!
Right, right.Alt: Okay, okay.
Maybe I should take it back home and test it out.
Oh, not at all.
You don't know about us?
Oh, my name's Mizunashi Akari, by the way.
I'm Hoshino Akiko.
Make yourself at at home.
I only came here six months ago, so I still don't have much.Alt: "so I don't have many things."; "the house is still bare."
Oh, no reason!
I built this wood deck myself.
Welcome to my Sunny Caf, where the sunlight warms up your whole body.
Would it be okay?
Of course. I'm making stuffed cabbage rolls.
Okay. This one should do. What do you think?
HuhEh, Wha? That water will come here to the canal today!
HuhEh What? Water will come to the canal?
HuhEh?! Really?!
Akari-chan!
I'm so sorry!
It's fine! They're just a little burned.
Yep, they taste great.
Uh, no problem.
What sort of job is it?
On a gondola?
They have that as a job now?
We only had a little snow a few days ago.
Card recorder?
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine, now that Sensei's here with us. Right, Sensei?
Everyone, cut that out!
This is Aqua, in the past.
Did I?
People who never gave up despite countless failures.
My, my, my! What's the matter?
Ai-chan, today is the 31st day of the 24th month.
That's why I'm headed out to Piazza San Marco to celebrate New Year's with everyone.
My, my!
This is the one time in the year where everyone sets aside their inhibitions.
WhaEhh?!
Why does she know so much about us?
Salamanders fight day and night
to keep Aqua comfortable for the people who live here, right?
Ai-chan...
I'm so happy!
They're so pretty!
Beans symbolize money, so they're supposed to bring you good fortune.
OOld man?
Aika, who is she?
You must be Akira-san, the Devildevil Instructor!
Ai-chan!
Hey, Sideburns! Where are you going?
Wow, it's pitch black.
HuhEh?
Well then, if we follow these lights, they'll lead us right back the way we came.
Lights to guide our path, huh?
My, my! Welcome back, Akari-chan, Ai-chan.
The biggest New Year's event in Neo-Venezia,
is when we throw away something at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Then I'll... throw this.
Yeah.
Auguri means best wishes, and buon anno means Happy New Year!
Akari-san!
Quattro!
Due!
Ai-chan, look behind you.
The sunlight is so warm.
I'm sure it will be.
She was so cute!
I look forward to working with you this year too.
To the wonderful world of Aqua itself...
That's why I'm headed out to Piazza San Marco to celebrate New Year's with everyone.
Whoa! It was almost like I could actually hear Ai-chan's voice just now.
Emails, huh?
Huh?
Ai-chan...
Little girl?
it's customary to eat food with beans in them at the end of the year.
We continue that custom here in this city, too.
I think your big brother might be a little cooler than you.
Oh, the gang's all here, huh?
You must be Akira-san, the Devildevil Instructor!
YYeah, Im fine...
Yeah.
Do you think maybe Aqua is welcoming me?
In that case, I'm glad!
I knew it, there's a hole!
It's about time for the countdown.
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you.
Alicia-san, I'll try extra hard this year to be great professional Undine!
Bye-byeGoodbye!
Isn't it.
To the wonderful world of Aqua itself.
Hmm... I'm not exactly sure myself.
Yeah! Ready, set...
It's the perfect chance for some major house cleaning here at Aria Company!
President Aria?
My, my, my.
Look at this, Akari-chan.
Ribbit, ribbit.
Ribbit.
President Aria sure is late.
President Aria!
My, my, my...
A revised version of President Aria's special stew.
Little girl! You dropped this!
Are you out on a walk, Aika-san?
President Hime, let's get... going...
OhAh, President Aria!
Oh, dear... Where did you drop him?
Ken-kun!
Ken-kun came back!
President Aria?
I washed the toilet with bath tub cleanser!
This really feels great!
Are you okay, President Aria?
Keep at it.
You can't let that cat show you up!
No! Ken-kun!
Oh, dear... Where did you drop him?
And look how dirty he is now.
Just kidding.
If I have to grow old, then I want to be a wonderful old person!
Wha?!
And you call yourself an Undine!
Navigation, canzone, people skills...
Wow...
Everything's coloured gold!
I am truly honored to make your acquaintance!
Aika-chan, why are you talking so strangely?
Wow! Look at all the fallen chestnuts!
Wow! You've gathered so many, Alice-chan!
This is training! Don't you two understand
Did you gather a lot of them?
YeahUh-huh!
We needed a lot?
Umm...
Let's see...
Now, look here...
What?! When did she...?!
Are you ready yet?
It looks like the mountains are on fire, doesn't it?
True.
It smells great!
It's a bath heated by firewoodIt's a wood-burning bath!.
You must be tired from today. Relax and wash all that sweat off.
What if we just end up playing around?
Really ticklish.
Yeah! That was a great bath.
Huh?
It's an early start tomorrow, so make sure you don't sleep in.
Good night, Grandma!
Amazing.
This is the first time I've seen such a starry night sky since I came to Aqua.
Just as the sky changes colour every day,
What do you all think of Alicia?
From A to Z,Everything she does is truly top class.
That girl is a master at making anything fun.
That... That's all there is to it?
The act of living day to day can truly be the most wondrous thing.
What you see, hear, and touch...
Do you find sculling your gondola fun?
You're too slow, Akari!
Me too.
I'm aiming for number one in Aqua.
The number one energetic and wonderful Undine star.
...because it sparkles so brightly.
No matter how old I get, I'll be the nice sort of grandma that everyone admires!
Even if no one looks up to you now, I'm sure one day
Huh? What do you mean, Aika-chan?
OhEh? You think so?
HuhEh? Legendary Great Water Fairy?
WhatWhoa! Don't tell me you don't know her?!
that legendary Great Water Fairy was the founderestablished of Aria Company.
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
So I'm on a short break.
Yep, that's the way!
Yay, we're here, we're here!
According to this, this village was based on Manhome's countryside.
Akari-chan, Aika-chan, and Alice-chan, right?
The lady who started Aria Company!
So we havewe are very thankful to take up taken up this gracious offer to receive couching from you.
THIS ONE!
Huh?
Well then, why don't you dig up some sweet potatoes for me?
Isn't it interesting?
Oh, that reminds meAh, that's right!
Ta-daa! Let's try some roasted chestnuts, too!
Stuff you gather yourself really does taste different, doesn't it?
Hot, hot, hot...
At lastFinally, the living legend's class is about to start!
You can smell the wood burning.
Fully refreshedFeel better?
Glad you liked it!
You're really loudobnoxious.
What's wrong, Alice-chan?
Space is really huge!
Wow!
this starry sky is one we can only see tonight.
And that space is really huge was kinda sappy as well!
That... That's all there is to it?
Take whatever comes, and change it inside yourself.
hhHonestly praising yourself when you try hard...
Do you find sculling your gondola fun?
Don't tell me you made it past three times?
Same for me!
Someday, I'd like to be as wonderful a lady as she is.
The number one energetic and wonderful Undine star.
A hot spring, huh? I wonder what it'll be like.
They're really rejuvenating, aren't they?
Next time, That Warm Holiday...
Hello, thank you for call
why do you have to butt in, Sideburns?
I'm not Sideburns...
No, you are Sideburns,
as long as you have those sideburns.
I wonder if this is how birds feel when they leave the nest.
I'm afraid she's busy today. I'm very sorry.
I really want to ride with her.
She's booked solid. I'm sorry.
I see. Well, I guess someone else would do.
I'm not a customer, so...
Ah, no, that can't be.
Still, it makes me happy to know I can do all that on my own.
You can't get that feeling on Manhome, right?
She just came from Manhome
Yes!
Let's see, it's been 150 years since Aqua was terraformed so people could live here.
Uh, today it has been reborn as a Planet of Water.
Maybe us meeting each other was another one of those miracles.
Oh?
On Manhome, they're normally cut up.
Um, isn't that...?
Mr. President!
We have to hurry!
My, my, you have Aika-chan with you too?
And this is?
She's, um...
Aren't you glad?
You see, before I came here, I hated Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
After she came back from her trip, all she talked about were stories from Aqua.
I'm really sorry for all the trouble.
That's okay.
It's okay, really.
They were discovering all the little ways that they irritated each other on that trip.
My, my, is there ever a day that isn't wonderful for you, Akari-chan?
Akari, let's go to a hot spring! A hot spring!
That's right.
I'm no good in cold weather,
Yeah, it's cold.
Good morning.
S-So cold...
You're lucky you're a Pair. What with both hands covered and warm.
What's gotten into you?!
Akari-chan?
Go on back... to your friends, okay?
There will be a lot of them in the city too.
OhAh, Akatsuki-san!
Wow! So Aqua's natural winter is actually much colder, isn't it?
How about you, Alice-chan?
HuhEh? What do you mean?
OhAh! Look at the chimneys!
Some of the houses have started using their fireplaces.
But you know, this scene almost feels warm in a way, doesn't it?
Let's make a hat and scarf for President Aria.
Here's yours, Akari-chan.
OhEh? WellAh, you see...
Akari-chan, Aika-chan, I'm heading in.
Right.
A lot of the actual house is ruined now, but that just adds flavour to it, doesn't it?
Akari-chan? Why don't you join us?
The water's great...
I can feel it spreading through my body!
Good morning.
Oh... You should have said something!
A hot spring in the sea...
I've relaxed as much as I can.
Excuse me.
AhhOh, I wanna stop already!
Akari, let's go to a hot spring! A hot spring!
A hot spring?
That's right.
S-So cold!
We Undines are professionals who must battle heat and cold...
SureHuh...
OhAh, Akatsuki-san!
That's right. The atmosphere is warmed up by the Salamanders working on Ukijima.
J-J-J-Ju-Ju-Ju-Just leabe it to us!
Everyone's getting ready for winter, huh?
Do you mean it?!
Alicia-san...
Hey.
C'mon, let's go home.
Let's make a hat and scarf for President Aria.
Thank you for your kindness!
This way, please.
Akari-chan, Aika-chan, I'm heading in.
Oh! Alicia-san!
HuhEh?
Yeah...
but the old couple who owned it had good taste.
Oh! A connoisseur!
Ah, paradise, paradise.
You need time to relax in order to get through the long, cold winter.
It's fine, reallyit's fine. There's someplace here that you need to see.
It's dark...
It connects to the sea!
Akari, say your prayers!
It smells sweet.
Yeah.
That was really relaxing, huh?
Take that!
After Aika, Alicia's next! I have to challenge you!
Snow?
but there are lots of wonderful things to make up for it.
No, never mind.
It is really freezing.
Ai-chan, this second winter I'm spending here in Neo-Venezia...
She acts like it's her company.
Athena-senpai, you act like this is your house.
Here you go!
Alicia! We're in a real pinch!
My, my, my!
Hi! Please excuse my friend Alicia.
but I've heard rumours that your company has a really talented Single working there.
The Palazzo Pisani Moretta is well-known for hosting masked balls.
So, Athena-senpai has always been really spacy, huh?
All right!
That was amazing, Athena-chan!
I wanted to be better at handling my oar and talking to people,
I can't remember the last time I got to drink Alicia's cocoa with fresh cream like this.
...by getting trapped thinking hh of the fun we used to have.
you'll never run out of things that you enjoy.
I'll have more cream in mine, please.
HuhOh?
They'll probably be talking till morning.
I had no idea all three of them trained together.
Right.
Hey! No yelling allowed!
Athena-san. Akira-san.
Alicia, I'll have some cocoa with fresh cream, please.
Shouldn't we be here?
Thank you.
We did almost everyday.
My, my.
Huh? Why not? Will I get fat or something?
My, my, my.
So what if you're embarrassed?
My, my, my!
It's okay, Athena-chan. Just relax.
It's not like I was hiding it, though.
Akari-senpai, Aika-senpai and I won't be able to see each other for practice anymore.
Yep. It's just like Athena-chan said.
If you enjoy what you're doing now, then now will always be the most enjoyable time.
HuhEhh?!
Next time, That Soft Wish...
President Aria!
President Aria, I'm coming right now!
Right, right.
Maybe I should take it back home and test it out.
I take it you only just came to Aqua?
Here we are. Make yourself at at home.
Thank you very much.
The two of us share a shining destiny,
Oh, no reason!
Will you help me bring some water in?
Thanks.
Sorry.
It's fine! They're just a little burned.
Really?
OhAh! Um... Sorry.
Yeah.
They have that as a job now?
Let's go back down to the bridge when we're done eating.
HuhEh?
Ukijima's shape is sort of different too.
They might fail again.
The cat?
So squishy...
Even this town will become lively.
That's right.
So many miracles occurred, as if in answer to their wishes.
How is it that water can refresh everything... even your heart?
So am I.
They say cats are animals which bind the past to the future.
Nothing. It's nothing.
Is it winter now?
Yeah. The oldest bridge in Neo-Venezia.
Because really, it's just an ordinary bridge with nothing special about it.
What's wrong?
Excuse me...
Those are unusual clothes.
OhAh, this the uniform of Aria Company.
Your president is a cat? And what's an Undine?
I take it you only just came to Aqua?
I'm Akiko Hoshino.
Sure!
YeahAh, that's my cat's name. He's a bit shy...
An Aquan year is twice that of Manhome, right?
Say, it looks like it's warmed up outside.
I think it's cute.
OhEhh?
OhAhh, the truth is I only came to Aqua a year and a half ago.
Oh.
Sorry.
WhaHuh?
OhAh! Um... Sorry.
So, you're an Undine?
UhAh, yes.
Surely the weather can't be that different on two sides of the same bridge.
HuhEh?
And we're finally getting water, too.
President?
Don't act so bossy, gachamon!
You said it two years ago, and five years ago, too!
Yeah. I never would have thought of building that wood deck by myself on Manhome.
Aqua is a handmade planet.
That's why you treasure that moment and never let it fade.
The window... When did that get opened?
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru
To the shining waves Hikaru nami e It really does.
Akatsuki.
I keep telling you, they're not sideburns.
Kidnapper.
Help me.
Ah...
Did you come here on your own? No, wait. That can't be.
I came with my dad and mom.
It's inconvenient.
You like this city?
So, how is it fair to give her a ride for free when she has money?
It tasted really good!
Well, shall we get going?
Gotcha!
Alicia!
It was you who called this morning, wasn't it, Ai?
I rode in other gondolas, but they were no fun at all.
I figured I should ride in Miss Alicia's gondola, since my sister bragged about that the most...
But I'm glad you let me ride with you today.
The baked potato was so good, and that back-paddling was a lot of fun!
What? I really promise.
...hurry up and become a Prima Undine, okay?
Someone you treasure...
Humming a secret melody Kuchizusanda himitsu no merodii
Filling your heart into a rainbow Atsumete yo kitto reinboo
Next Episode On That Special Day...
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru This is the first time you've seen the Acqua Alta, isn't it?
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru Acqua... Alta?
To the shining waves Hikaru nami e
I'm on my way, Undine Yuku wa, Undine
we may discover something new.
C'mon, let's go.
You can't tell where the streets start and stop anymore, can you?
Splish... huh?
I wasn't expecting this.
Huh?
Akari, what are you doing out there?
Then that kitty must be President Hime!
Just what you'd expect from the only daughter of the Himeya family.
You've been studying, haven't you?
But, going out in a gondola on a day like this is-
So, you're the other half of the comedy duo.
Not only did a Single like you take along a customer on her own,
I'll never come back to Himeya again!
Akari! You've got rice on your face!
And it doesn't end there.
I know that together with Alicia and Athena from Orange Planet,
Huh?
Just hold still.
Alicia was still just a Single back then.
Switch with me, Akari!
Huh?!
You've got 10 seconds to get down here!
My, my.
Always coming in to take all the best stuff for yourself.
No "hee-hee-hee's" allowed either!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
Get set...
Who knows. It's up to Aika, now.
Fine, but where are we going?
Um, Aika? I don't think we're supposed to go this way.
But, what about the race?
Doesn't matter.
I never knew there was such a pretty square here.
but deep down, she's a very nice person.
Will surely fly over the rainbow Koetekuwa kitto reinboo
Next Episode Aika, who is that girl?
Next Episode You're really obnoxious.
Next Episode With That Transparent Young Girl... Next time, "With That Transparent Young Girl..."
When you're alone for a long time, you start to feel separated from your emotions.
I sway among the sound of waves Namioto ni yurarete
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru "Especially today, when even the sun reflected in the water is so dazzling."
...the path that the wind takes Kaze no yuku michi ga "But, when I take that brightly-polished oar in my hands,"
...the path that the wind takes Kaze no yuku michi ga "my reward is that I become one with the wind."
Ah! Alice, would you like to have breakfast with us?
They're gonna hold onto it, too.
Oh, good morning.
Excuse me.
Oh, no! It's our pleasure!
She's supposedly a genius at handling the oar.
Poor kids.
My name isn't Sideburns.
Or worse than amateur!
Man, I'm waiting for someone, but they haven't shown up.
I was just about to have Sideburns here give me a free ride. Um, you see, Akatsuki's an acquaintance of mine, so...
...who was in charge of the original settlers on Aqua.
Hm? What's wrong?
Heh... She really saved you that time.
Isn't it rude of you to keep calling her Sideburns like that?
Never mind that! Hurry up and tell me about the statue!
You Salamanders work day and night without rest...
Ah! Akatsuki! Please don't stand up!
Akatsuki! The best way to kill time at times like this is to people-watch!
Take that old man over there.
Sure!
The people who immigrated to Aqua from Manhome...
Just make your way ahead, slow and steady.
open your heart, let it lighten, and if you can become one with the wind...
Good job, Sideburns.
Would you like to come up to the island for a visit?
What should we do, Alice? Should we go?
I'll join you.
I carried it gently in the palm of my hand Te no hira no ue ni sotto noseta
The two of us, over the rainbow Futari de oobaa za reinboo
Next Episode It might be a bad luck chain letter.
I wonder if we Undines could do it, too.
Unless they're really big feelings.
"Ai, along with water fairies and fire-watchers,"
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru Akari?
...the path that the wind takes Kaze no yuku michi ga Sure.
This is the sort of scene that makes me want to hurry home for the night.
I wonder if there's a card reader left that can read it.
Sure thing!
Um... Sorry. Not yet.
Is it break time already? Welcome back.
Mr. Postman! What did you find?
Yeah. No luck, unfortunately.
Well, you see... It doesn't exist anymore.
Could someone still be there?
I reckon it'd take you a month.
Hey there! I've got a delivery for the Aria Company!
All right, is that everything, then?
I'm thankful, but kind of sorry about that, too.
I wonder if saury and mackerel feel like this when they swim, too.
This is the first time I've ever swam out this far.
When we ride these, we help deliver someone's precious feelings.
Right!
According to the map, it should be somewhere around here.
Coming!
"You once said that Neo-Venezia was made of miracles."
And the bluebird will surely grant it Kanaete yo kitto aoi tori
Next Episode I'd rather go on a relaxing tour.
"I never considered it a fantasy story at all."
I wonder who it was.
The gentle wind strokes my cheek Hoho o naderu yasashii kaze
And I can feel my whole body relax Karada no naka hodoketeyuku yo
Come, let's paddle away Saa, kogidasou All right, then! Wait for me!
Come, let's let others feel Nee, tsutaeyou
Yeah.
It didn't say who it was from, so I figured it was the older girls playing a trick on me.
What's wrong?
Maybe they've lured us here in the hopes of showing us our dreams, then crushing them.
Why are we running?
There's no place like this, even in Neo-Venezia!
Huh?
The worst possible outcome I could ever imagine...
Quite.
Come on! Doesn't running... barefoot on the sand... feel... sort of nice?
Got it? Don't be scared of falling in the water!
Akari! Don't slouch!
This... is... really... hard!
Right...
Aika! Where's that smile?! Never shoulda come here...
My, my...
Why are they coming out, too?
Can't move...
This is delicious, Alicia!
Wait, Aika!
Do you ever run out of ways to see the bright side of things?
Oh? Akari, your ribbon...
Oh, yeah. My mother said she'd buy me a new one.
Be sure to eat the vegetables, too! We've got plenty!
It's perfect!
True.
Because you're a wonderful person, Akari.
Filling your heart into a rainbow Atsumete yo kitto reinboo
Will surely fly over the rainbow Koetekuwa kitto reinboo
"Akari, today I made a buttered baked potato."
"I wanted to make something yummy for my dad and mom to eat."
I close my eyes, and then I can see... Me o tojite mietekuru Wasn't that just the prettiest voice you ever heard?
...the path that the wind takes Kaze no yuku michi ga I think it's more important for an Undine to be good at sculling the gondola.
Come, let's let others feel Nee, tsutaeyou
This excitement in our hearts Kono tokimeki I've noticed lately how clumsy my left hand is.
The problem is that they don't allow pets.
You want to stay over, Akari?
I think we should be okay for now.
There's no ketchup.
Athena brought it for her, but she didn't even notice.
Oh? What's wrong?
She'll trip on a surface that's totally flat.
Orange Planet's president died a few days ago.
Maa looks a lot like your old president, huh?
Y- Yeah...
the large-scale Aqua migration project began.
Everyone nearly found out about Maa yesterday. the large-scale Aqua migration project began.
Maa!
Did you find the cat?
We heard a cat meowing in your room.
Alice...
Maa!
Maa looks relieved.
Athena...
"But still, thanks to that,"

Sorry.
Miss Akira! Over here!
"Miss Akira of the respected Himeya company, one of the Three Great Water Fairies."
Jeez...
President?
The Teatro La Fenice.
Yes, ma'am.
Um, let's see..."Neo-Venezia has many festivals and events..."
There's a statue of the Virgin Mary down this way.
Because this way we get to see the Undines being trained firsthand!
So you think sculling and being pleasant are simple things anyone could do?
Now then, sir and madam, please look to your right.
Yeah.
We have another intersection.
Wait, you mean Alicia of the Three Great Water Fairies?
My, my!
I brought a cake!
I'm overjoyed to be able to have tea with you, Miss Alicia!
Let's start with Akari!
Then which way?!
I'm not sure how good of an idea it is, but...
We've got a lot of obstacles in here.
Will we be okay?
What, you want me to scold you?
Right! Let's eat! Right! Let's eat!
"Ai, it may be rough getting scolded,"
Among the changing seasons... Utsuriyuku kisetsu no naka de

I'm so excited about the year to come!
...to keep Aqua comfortable for hhthe people who live here, right?
Where?!
Hm?
They're so pretty!
Those are beans made from Neo-Venezian glass.
Well, I have to be going. See you, ladies!
Oh, boy...
What is it?
Look at this! All of you together, and as close as you ever were.
Mr. President!
Just now... Was that Aqua in the past?
HuhEh?
A lot has happened this past year.
This year has been so...
What is it, Akari-chan?
Otto!
Due!
I've come to pick you up, Ai.
What a wonderful name.
The sunlight is so warm.
No sappy lines allowed.
Alicia-san, I'll try extra hard this year to be great professional Undine!
We're meeting up with Atsushi-san in the afternoon, right?
Yeah! Ready, set...
Emergency food reserve!
I wonder if he did it as a favor to us, so he wouldn't be in the way while we clean.
Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit?
Well, that does it for the cleaning.
tonight I made my special rice omelettes!
Yay! Let's eat!
Is it good, President Aria?
Aika!
"Who is he, and where is he from?" she thinks. Okay, then let's go!
Definitely never, ever reveal your true identity.
Oh? Do you want to help me?
Oh, dear... Where did you drop him? No! Ken!
Thank you!
The sunset that day...
The sunset that day... ...out of all the sunsets he had ever seen...
Those feelings that never change Kawaranu omoi o
Can you hear it? Yes, the song of joy is... Kiite, shiawase no uta wa

Huh? What do you mean, Aika?
No, not at all.
Huh? Legendary Great Water Fairy?
Wow...
You didn't know?
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
"Our" skills?
You should be proper and call her "Grandmother!"
She's a living legend, after all!
Wow, I wonder if I can do that.
Hurry, hurry!
Isn't it pretty?
It's an honor to meet you!
There's no need to be so formal. Please, call me Grandma.
Yes, ma'am! We're on it!
Just doing what I can.
Isn't it interesting?
Grandma's a nice person, isn't she, President Aria?
Wow! This is great!
Let's eat! Let's eat!
Yay!
Aika, you're so melodramatic.
It's all your fault, you!
The way the stars twinkle makes it seem like they're speaking.
I think she steers effortlessly,
then becoming the brightest star Undine on Aqua isn't a dream.
Make everything something to enjoy...
"Your smile shines clearer than the stars in the night sky..."
Someday, over the rainbow Itsuka wa oobaa za reinboo

Of course.
And the sight is dyed deep into your heart Kokoro made mo somatte yuku yo
That Warm Holiday...
Snowbug?
And then, when it gets really cold,
Let's buy a little more food than usual.
Oh! Akatsuki!
So Salamanders are the guardians who keep Aqua warm, right?
What's wrong, Akari?
Oh! Yes, please!
Some of the houses have started using their fireplaces.
I've really come to love these winter sunsets.
C'mon, let's go home.
Okay Akari, first, hold the knitting needles like this...
Wow.
Welcome.
Here's yours, Akari.
Right.
Wow...
Coffee milk is just the thing for drinking after a hot bath!
Oh! A connoisseur!
I can feel it spreading through my body!
Alicia, are you sure we should?
My heart's really pounding.
Alicia, don't tell me you've been to this hot spring before?
She does have a point. Okay, then!
Huh? Aika?
Akari, say your prayers!
This is almost like a dream.
Your companions have arrived.
And Athena.
Let's stay up all night partying!
Not bad!
I'm serious!
"but there are lots of wonderful things to make up for it."
That rainbow you see when the rain clears... Ameagari no niji miageta sora ni
You know, when I'm curious about something, I'm curious now!
"In the daytime, the sun is covered by a layer of lead-colored clouds."
Alicia, we're back!
I'll get you something warm to drink.
Oh? Is there something wrong with that?
Here you go.
What about it? Thank you.
She was laughing?! She was laughing?!
So Akira was always showing up here.
Hi! Please excuse my friend Alicia.
If you know anything about that...
You really are a pain.
Athena, hang on!
Alicia, you go first.
I still enjoy my work, and besides...
in the time you pass with the people you're with,
you'll never run out of things that you enjoy.
But Aika, I didn't say anything!
Huh? Sure.
Nighty-night!
Surrounded by the scent of jasmine, I would sway Jasumin no hana no kaori sotto yureta nara

What is this place? Is it Neo-Venezia?
My, my.
Didn't you say yesterday that there was someplace you wanted to go?
Really?
Wait, please!
Maybe I should take it back home and test it out.
Yes!
Sorry to intrude.
So, how do you like Aqua?
Do people say stuff like that to you?
I built this wood deck myself.
With a menu of sincerity and tranquility, right?
No sappy lines allowed? No sappy lines allowed?
You'll stay for lunch, right?
Of course. I'm making stuffed cabbage.
It's small, but it'll taste great.
Today is the last day that it'll take so much effort to draw water outside the city.
Wha? That water will come here to the canal today!
Akari!
I give tours through the city on a gondola.
Well, we're closed today because it's the off-season.
Huh?
Huh?
It's been really cold lately, since Ukijima's output has been kind of unstable.
That data card... Do you normally use those?
Teacher!
Yes, I'm sure of it! You think it'll be lots of water, Teacher?
Yes, I'm sure of it! No, we don't know for sure!
No, we don't know for sure!
So squishy...
This is Aqua, in the past.
It'll work.

Big brother...
Hm?

My, my!
Oh, boy...
Akari, this girl needs to be reined in!
It's like being able to meet the characters from a novel.
It's been a while, Grandma.
Hey, Sideburns! Where are you going?
Y-Yeah, I'm fine...
Let's go, Ai.
Letters really do carry your feelings beyond time and space, don't they?
I knew it, there's a hole!
Auguri... buon anno?
Auguri means "best wishes," and buon anno means "Happy New Year!"
Right!
Wonderful meetings. Important, irreplaceable moments.
...I just feel very sad to see it go.
N-No sappy... lines...
Dieci!
Ai, look behind you.
Sis!
Oh? You're Ai's sister? Here, take my seat! I came here to see you, Ai.
What a wonderful name.
My, my! That's great, Aqua!
I hope this year will be as wonderful as the last.
Me too.
I can feel the sun washing over my entire body.
Yeah. See you later.
Yes.
Akari... Auguri, buon anno.
And to all the people I have yet to meet...
Won't bother me Ki ni shinai

Twenty months have flown by since the day I first arrived on Aqua.
Don't worry about me.
It's a new world!
OhAh, Mr. President.
HuhEh?
I know. From now on, I'm your friend.
Do you like gondolas?
You can't get that feeling on Manhome, right?
Is this an interrogation?
I know! Aika-chan, let's go see Alicia-san.
Neo-Venezia is modeled after the city of Venice, which originally existed on Manhomefscx150
You like this city?
a city was built from the wishes of those who wanted to build it.
A wonderful miracle.
The potato's so big.
Oh.
Gotcha!
Yeah, and that's why she always treats me like a little kid.
It's okay, really.
I remember that couple!
Looks like they made up.
It takes a little work to learn to like something that first irritates you.Alt: "learn to accept something that get's on your nerves." BD: "learn to love something you hate." -- Strong words and doesn't really make sense in English.
Heh, heh, heh.Ehehe
Alice-chan...
Whoa! It was almost like I could actually hear Ai-chan's voice just now.
OOld man?
Yes, how do you do? I'm Al the Gnome.
There we go, President Aria! Boing! Boing
Hey, Sideburns. Who's the old lady?
We'll be right back! Ai-chan, wait up!
President Aria!
Ai-chan! Are you okay?
YYeah, Im fine...
President Aria?
HuhEh?
Akari-senpai and the little girl have been gone a long time. You think they're okay?
The biggest New Year's event in Neo-Venezia,
is when we throw away something at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
What is it, Akari-chan?
We must have fallen asleep at some point.
Look, Aqua! The sun is rising!
HuhEh?
Alicia-san, I'll try extra hard this year to be great professional Undine!
Aika, you should be saying that kind of stuff to me.
My, my!
I can feel the sun washing over my entire body.
Ai-chan and her sister looked really happy.
And to all the people I have yet to meet...
Uh-huh? You're not surprised?
pretty much everything in the city has to shut down,
I can't see the sky from my room,
Yes?
I'm off.
Well, today is the acqua alta,
Whoa...
Splash. Huh?
Hm? Maybe this isn't the right way.
Hm, now what?
Would you quit talking nonsense and just come in already?
I see. Sorry to bother you.
Is that food for the President?
It feels like you're saying I'm like an old lady.
So you've been studying, haven't you?
Who knows.
You can exercise or practice your singing.
She's always been like that.
Alicia-san is kind, unlike you, Akira-san.
All right.
Right.
Really?
Being an Undine isn't just the techniques!
I thought I'd be able to spend the night with Alicia-san,
I ran away like I did today, but I had no place to go.
That's why Alicia-san is so special to me.
Anyone home?
Yikes!
I'll name some right now!
My, my, my.
And even after we both swore to become Primas together,
And you can eat more than me without ever getting fat!
No tehehe's allowed either!
My, my. Tehehe!
They were childhood friends?
Okay, how about this?!
Okay, go!
Huh?
Oops a daisy!
What?
I actually won the race.
What's your name?
What? I wonder if I'll be able to handle it.
That uniform is Orange Planet's!
This is Aika-chan from Himeya.
I'm an eighth grader in middle school at the moment.
There's no way I'm going to let her beat us now!
Wait, Aika-chan.
But still, they really do smell so nice!
Hey, Aika-chan, Aika-chan?
What a lovely gift!
Oh no! It's our pleasure!
Really?Alt: Wow...
Alice-chan does that, huh?
See ya.
C'mon, let's get back home and have these as a snack!
It's fine if I'm not a customer, right?
I wonder what's going on.
I keep telling you, they're not sideburns.
Alice-chan!
In other words, um, Akatsuki-san is an acquaintancefscx150
It was originally built when the migration to Aqua began,BD: It was originally built to be the palace of the colonial governor
You're becoming quite good at this, Sideburns.
Continuing on, this is Piazza San Marco.
She's just like the others.
Yeah, this world is protected thanks to guys like me.
Ah! Akatsuki-san, please don't stand up!
Akatsuki-san's older brother?
Now I get it.
If you'd like, why don't you come up to the island for a visit?
So how about some sightseeing up on Ukijima?
What should we do, Alice-chan? Wanna go?
Unless they're really big feelings.
Yay!
That's really cool.
Wha? Are you two just teasing me?
there are wind messengers called Sylphs too!
What a wonderful job!
Also, could you go buy some bread at the bakery after you're done there?
We don't have enough for tomorrow morning.
Where are you going, President Aria?
Huh?
HuhEh? Me?
Hm, not there.
I'll look into it when I get back to the post office.
Well, if you find out the address, you should be able to deliver it quickly.
Right.
I'm sure this address isn't used anymore.
There were bases all over the place that dug up the underground ice.
Thank you very much!
Alicia-san must've bought these by mail order.
Well, is that everything then?
Akari!
You really can't say no, can you?
Will you be okay?
Right!
Is your water bottle filled?
I'd rather you compare it to dolphins or mermaids or something.
What?! You gonna quit being an Undine?!
I just think that's kind of wonderful.
But then we'd become business competitors!
I think I just saw something in the ocean!
I borrowed it from the florist.
Wow, that's amazing! You can fly one of those!
Maybe that letter was mailed before news of the accident reached the writer,
Oh. Coming!
I'll let you get away with leaving me alone on our wedding anniversary just this once!
I believe in those words.
Even though there are a lot of tough times right now,
And so do I. Honestly, I want to head out there right now to see you.
but that place had vanished.
Something like The Grand Sappy Lines Tour?
Could that be it? Is that Neverland?
Oh?
Yeah.
so I figured it was one of my seniors at the company playing a trick on me.
I knew it!
But I want to turn professional as soon as I can!
In her absence, I hope you do well, Orange Planet apprentice.
Is Athena-san your instructor, Alice-chan?
She's one of the Three Great Water Fairies, along with Alicia-san and Akira-san.
First, change into your swimsuits!
First, by riding across the waves,
Akari, no slouching allowed!
Again!
Right!
The last exercise will be a competitive race!
Mm! These sandwiches are great, Alicia!
This is delicious, Alicia-san!
I hope it really feels like the ocean of Neverland to you, Akari-chan.
Alicia-san, thank you so much!
It almost feels like a paradise, doesn't it?
Hey.
It's all wonderful, somehow...
This is great!
When I was little, I believed Neverland was a real place.
But when I grew up, I realised it was a fantasy.
Because forgetting a memory doesn't mean you've abandoned it, right?
Yeah. That's a good way to put it.
The memories I thought I'd forgotten are just sleeping inside me.
And when they unexpectedly peek out at you at times,
Thank you so much for inviting us here today!
You're really nosy.
Don't worry about it!
Wasn't that the prettiest voice you ever heard?
then I'll never be able to write with it, either.
It leaves everything for the right hand to do.
Not only that, it acts like that's the most natural thing in the world,
The problem is that they don't allow pets.
I named her Maa-kun because she meows maa! all the time.
Why don't we take her back to my company?
I usually have my meals here.
What's this?BD: "Huh?" too many of these.
Athena-senpai is as clumsy as she looks.
Alice-chan! You shouldn't talk like that about a senior when she can hear you!
I should use my left hand at times like this.
Maa-kun, dinnertime.
Yes?
Maa-kun!
Athena-senpai knew about Maa-kun.
Athena-senpai.
Hm?
The left hand really is a big helper!
Akari-san, about the buttered baked potato.
an8Okay, now that everyone's here, let's begin your combined training.
Alicia may coddle you, but I won't!
It's a pleasure to meet you, dear guests.
Okay!
Seriously!Alt: "C'mon." The other obvious alternative is way overused
Yes.
Shall I reserve some tickets for you?
We'll make a slight detour here.
Gondola, coming through!
We'll join in the training too!
Oh?
Really?
First is Akari!
Yes!
Aika!
Now then, sir and madam, please look to your right.
This is the narrowest place yet. You think she'll be all right?
But you spoke so softly that the gondola at the crossing couldn't hear you.
Gondola, coming through.
Sorry.
Then which way?!
Listen, you three.
Any mistake you make, you have to follow up on.
Don't tell them that! Why don't you show them what to do?
Around dawn, I think.
It's very slow, but there seems to be a current flowing here.BD: "to be a current in this water." Too literal; not natural English.
Going that way.
You think a gondola can get through here?
What's wrong, Aika-chan?
Excuse me a moment.
Thank goodness!
We made it out!
Aika-chan you're a crybaby!
Um,
No! Please don't go to any trouble on our account!
Basically, you've all reflected on this already, haven't you?
Ready, set...
Maybe I should take a quick look around?
And now I really want to try that special omurice too!
Little girl! You dropped this!
Take it to her?
Is that you, President Aria?
Oh? Al-kun!
Yeah. Since we Gnomes work underground,
OhEh? DoCould it be you want to help me?
OhWhoa or Hey, what's with this cat?
Right...
No! Ken-kun!
Just kidding.
Yeah!
It's the perfect chance for some major house cleaning here at Aria Company!
President Aria?
OhAh, this is terrible, Alicia-san!
OhMy? President Aria?
Please don't look for me.
Your right.
Akari-san, somehow, it's like you've managed
This?
Oh? Al-kun!
Ah, Aika-san.
There's a great place near here!
OhAh, President Aria!
OhEh? DoCould it be you want to help me?
You can't let that cat show you up!
Wha?!
Even if no one looks up to you now, I'm sure one dayfscx150
What's wrong, Aika-chan? Why all the sighing?
Are we... really okay... like this?
My dream is to surpass Alicia-san and the others, the current Three Great Water Fairies, obviously.
HuhEh? Legendary Great Water Fairy?
Wow...
My, my, all done with your training?good work with your training.
No goofing off allowed! Got it?
Akari, please!
I understand, Grandma!
I pity what's going to happen to themnext.
Did you gather a lot of them?
Are you ready yet?
Really tasty!exquisite
H-Hot, hot, hot...
Should we be doing this? I thought we came here for training.
It smells great!
Phew, I think I may have overeaten.
This time for sure the class is going to start, right?
Huh?
You'll sleep well tonight.
Space is really huge!
Wow!
OhAh, thank you very much.
They really are warm.
Just as the sky changes color every day, this starry sky is one we can only see tonight.
And that space is really huge was kinda sappy as well!
Yes?
Surely, since she was your number one student, you must have worked her so hard
Make everything something to enjoy.Oh if only it was that simple...
You're too slow, Akari!
I wanna be the number one star!
Don't tell me you made it past three times?
Grandma really is an amazing person, isn't she?
Grandma really is a wonderful person, isn't she?
They're great! They really warm you up!
Akari, let's go to a hot spring! A hot spring!
A hot spring?
You aren't good in cold weather either, are you, Akari-san?
Wow, the window's completely white.
What's gotten into you?!
Would you like to gather firewood today?
Well then, see ya later!
Alicia-san...
Some of the houses have started using their fireplaces.
I've really come to love these sunsets.
Come on, let's go home as well.
Welcome!
What a great room!
Welcome.
Oh? Well, you see,
Wait!
No clumsy slowpokes allowed.
HuhEh?
It's slippery, so watch your step.
It was originally just a big old mansion,
Relaxing in the warmth.
I was so relaxed that I fell asleep.
and the sunsets that seem to fall lovingly on the houses,
My, my!
They say you should go into a hot spring three times.
It connects to the sea!
Me too!
Yeah.
From heaven, to hell.
Not bad!
I see.
I'd like to see Neo-Venezia in winter too.
No, never mind.
I can't believe how cold it is today!
Athena-san. Akira-san.
I suppose it's all right, but...
That's true.
so there were no other apprentices there when I joined.
OhEh?
Oy!
Here you go, President Aria.
Huh?
So, you never ended up meeting that Single you heard about?
Gondola, coming through!
Okay! Then why don't you show us how it's done, Akira-chan?
Just as I thought, Athena-san was the Single you'd heard about.
Since she never really sang, I never realized.
But, even though it was hard, I admitted defeat.
I wanted to be better at handling my oar and talking to people,
That's true.
I can't remember the last time I got to drink Alicia's cocoa with fresh cream like this.
Someday...
That's true.
No... sappy lines...
We shouldn't say the old days were fun.
But they hardly ever get together now.
Good night!
Looks like we can close for the day.Official subs which again, are wrong: We've had so much that it's hardly worth opening shop
Why not go?
I thought so.
Sure!
No sappy lines allowed.
I guess, although I smashed a lot of fingers doing it.
I think it's cute.
We seem more and more alike all the time!
Akari-chan!
I knew an amateur like me shouldn't have tried this!
Oh! This is actually good!
What sort of job is it?
Let's go back down to the bridge when we're done eating.
HuhEh?
Once the climate stabilizes a bit more, I'll be able to grow vegetables without a greenhouse.
I have a brand new data card all ready to go.
It's the surest way of getting a message to someplace far away, you know.
OhAhh, Akiko-san, you're a schoolteacher?
Yep, I'm sure of it.
Everyone, cut that out!
If the water comes, more people will come to Aqua.
OhAh, if you think about it...
I feel like the planet's finally saying it's okay for us to live on this world.
It's the beginning of so many wonderful things.
They say cats are animals which bind the past to the future.
My, my, my! What's the matter?
Next time: That White Morning...
No sappy lines allowed!!
HuhEhh?!
My second New Year's Eve since coming to Aqua has arrived.
Okay! There we go.
My, my. Thank you.
Yeah! My sisterOnee-chan should be meeting me at dawn.
Why is that?
Akari-san, Akatsuki-san is just as cool as you said he was!
Oh, that's right! That's right!
What a cute little kid!
What do you mean by gotten, Ai-chan?
I've gotten to meet three of the people from your emails.
Beans?
Beans symbolize money, so they're supposed to bring you good fortune.
They're pretty popular.
Well? Does it make you feel like happiness is on its way?
Aika, who is she?
My, my.
Okay, stop right there!
Meeting the people she only knows from my emails.
It's like being able to meet the characters from a novel.
No sappy lines allowed!
I see you're looking well.
Wow! She's Grandma? She's wonderful!
Thank you, Aika-chan.
Hey, Sideburns! Where are you going?
Wow, it's pitch black.
A cat?
Same here.
HuhEh?
It can be anything you've used in the past year.
Dieci!
Cinque!
Due!
Huh? Ai-chan's sister? Oh, here, take my seat.Would split if not for the short onscreen time
That's right.
Alicia-san, Auguri, buon anno!
To the people who made this wonderful world.italics?
Alicia-san! Alicia-san! We've got a problem!
Could you go buy some?
Okay!
Shall we go buy you some food, Mr. President?
we might discover something new!
You can't tell where the streets start and stop anymore, can you?
Splash, splash...
Splish, splash,
Would you quit talking nonsense and just come in already?
Aquamarine is said to be the sea goddess that protects ships.
So you've been studying, haven't you?
Push-ups, sit-ups. Hindu squats! You can do something, right?
but you also managed to get Aika in on the act.
Honestly! There's a limit to how soft that Alicia can be.
All right.
Aika-chan, please apologize!
Please, I'm begging you!
OhEh? she's a completely different type from Alicia-san, isn't she.
She secretly gave me a ride in her gondola because I was so sad.
Well, let's get you home.
Any  one  home?!
Or else I'll drown you in the Neo-Adriatic Sea!
If you have something to say to me, I'll listen.
I'll name some right now!
My, my!
Not to mention, your skin's lighter than mine!
My, my. Hee-hee!
Walnut bread?
I never knew there was such a beautiful square here.
What's your name?
When did I open the window?
My my, what is it?
You're right.
Take care of it, Akari-chan.
Yes.
Hello, thank you for your call--
Akatsuki-san...
If you're inquiring about a gondola booking, I can--
My second summer... is just around the corner!
If I were a professional...
I used to live on Man-Home too.
Eh? No...
She came from Man-Home--
C'mon, hurry up and get off.
Well, of the both of us, that would be me.
Because you're my friend.
Also, there's no reason to service a free-rider that much.
That's all it was, but...
I suppose I'll have one.
Do you have any money?
Sure sure, thanks.
Here I go!
Okay! Keep going straight.
President Aria!
You knew?
Saying that you wanted to ride Alicia-san's gondola...
You see, before I came here, I hated Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
But... the places they took me were all boring.
So I thought I would have to ride Alicia-san's gondola that my sister boasted about the most...
Maybe she just wanted to tell you about Aqua.
I see. Yeah, that's right.
How can we make it up to you?
No, I don't mind at all.
Eh? I really promise I will!
They started fighting in the gondola...
Yes, but it was troublesome back then.
I'm really taking it easy today.
It all started this morning...
I wonder if the whole city looks like the blue sky?
I can't see the sky from my room,
Yep, so I'll leave things to you, Akari-chan.
C'mon, let's go.
Slowly, slowly...
Okay, pop quiz!
So you've been studying, haven't you?
You can exercise or practice your singing.
So, you're the other half of the comedy duo.
but you also managed to get Aika in on the act.
At least Alicia-san wouldn't yell at me without letting me explain!
Aika-chan, maybe calm down a little, okay?
What?!
Why should I? I didn't do anything wrong.
My, my, my!
Well, they're all business rivals, aren't they?
I'll name some right now!
There it is. That mischievous little smile you specialise in.
No hee-hee-hee's allowed either!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
What's so fine about it?!
Please.
Aika-chan, wait.
It doesn't matter.
Akira-san is like the acqua alta.
Safe!
something important that you can't normally see is revealed.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together!
Good morning.
egao ga sugu koboreru A smile is immediately brought to my face.
Take care of it, Akari-chan.
A-ka-ri.
Well, hurry up, let's go.
But... I'm still an apprentice, I can't take customers...
I know.
Huh? She's the one who just called...
It's inconvenient.
Can I ask your name?
I'm Mizunashi Akari.
Ai-chan.
Why did you get on my gondola?
Huh? Why should I?
Ahh... I thought it might be more fun with a guide.
Maybe our meeting was a miracle, too!
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!
I've eaten them at home before, and didn't really like them...
It's completely different to eating one on Man-Home!
I suppose I'll have one.
It looks hard to eat.
Thank you very much.
Huh?
President!
Alicia-san.
Alicia-san was beautiful.
so I asked Mom and Dad.
I'm sorry.
I feel like listening to my sister's stories about Aqua now!
How can we make it up to you?
I was thinking of asking Alicia-san if it would be okay during lunch tomorrow.
Email me, okay?
They must have been bewildered finding out about parts of each other they didn't like for the first time.
Preview
I think I understand why people want to take it easy...
I just said I wanted to take it easy...
Acqua Alta?
so everyone spends time at home relaxing.
It sounds like it's difficult having the entire town flooded out, but...
I'm off.
Yes, certainly.
Yes!
you might make a new discovery!
...slowly, slowly.
Oh dear!
Splish, splash...
Huh?
I wonder if we can make it back.
Aika-chan!
Normally people take it easy at home today.
I'll take it!
President Hime's blue eyes are always beautiful, no matter how many times I see them.
Yep, not too bad.
and you even met up with Aika on the way.
She's always been like that,
I won't come back to Himeya again!
Aika-chan, apologize! Let's practice, let's do Hindu squats!
Why? I haven't done anything wrong, why should I apologize?
Aika-chan...
You think?
That's right. So because I love Alicia-san, she's jealous.
It got wet.
Well, do you feel better?
But that's what made me decide...
that I would become an undine.
I see.
Swap with me, Akari!
You're joking, right?
Ack!
Two!
Alicia, why are you here?
Because this is Aria Company.
You can eat more than me, and not put on weight!
Not allowed!
My my!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
Eh? Why did it turn out like this?
I wonder what will happen?
I said they weren't allowed, didn't I?
and brings out a different side of you.
That's true,
so if she thinks "I should go back," she'll lose on purpose to keep her pride.
Huh... Huh?
Acqua Alta: "High water" in Italian.
But because of Akari-san's email, a blue sky has spread through my heart.
Oh, that's right.
and if you do something different from the norm, on a day that's different from the norm...
Slowly, slowly...
...slowly, slowly.
That's no good!
Eh?
Huh? Isn't that kitty cat...
Stop saying stuff I don't understand, and come in.
Dunno, I haven't seen her since this morning.
Well, please do.
You have a dignity about you that makes it feel like you're not above me.
Eh?!
I wonder who first decided that having a blue-eyed cat as president was a symbol of assurance.
and "Don't mess up your room!" She's just really noisy.
That's right, a demon.
Really?
Hello there.
Ah!
Stay still.
I see.
Ack!
Get down here before I count to ten!
We're leaving, Aika.
If you stay here, "my my" will rub off on you.
Your "my my"-s are annoying too!
you always take all the good bits!
I'll do it too, I'll do it too...
Giggles aren't allowed either!
Get set.
Fast!
Aika-chan, what are you going to do?
I wonder what will happen?
My my.
She is the only one who faces up to me.
Akira-san is like the Acqua Alta.
The "not allowed, not allowed" part is just like Akira-san.
Safe!
ikutsumono niji koete yukeru yo Pass over the many rainbows,
Whaaat?!
This is Aika-chan from Himeya.
Ah... Alice-chan, do you want to eat breakfast with us?
Are you going to school now?
What a lovely gift!
No, the pleasure is all ours!
You also had an interview, didn't you?
Hey, Pigtails.
Not at all, this is nothing...
Yeah, I suppose.
So, Pigtails... Guide me around this area to kill some time.
because she's got long pigtails.
It's just like Akatsuki-san, isn't it...
Eh?
All right, as a reward for saying something good, you can guide me around some more, Pigtails.
Huh? Well...
Argh! He's still not here!
the secret behind this person's smile.
Using the water skillfully...
How's your first time on Ukijima?
Becoming one with the wind... would feel good, wouldn't it...
Why are you so happy?
Next time: "That Undeliverable Letter..."
I think that's probably because you haven't smiled recently.
Huh? The current flow became more complex.
It's different to our sad Pair days when we had to wear two gloves.
Oh, she's still a Pair!
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed.
Yeah.
Oh, she's the one from before!
Ah, she's leaving! What are you going to do?
Yes! See ya.
Which one should I have?
Hey, Pigtails.
I'm not Pigtails.
Are you okay?
It's an expression of affection.
Eh?
Pigtails was about to show me around for free.
Practice with me, she says... With me...
Oh... You're becoming quite good at this, Pigtails.
and to the left is the bell tower.
Hey Pigtails, what's that?
All right, as a reward for saying something good, you can guide me around some more, Pigtails.
Alice-chan, is the time all right for you?
How can you be amused at things that don't matter like that?
Proceeding slowly and calmly...
If you'd like, why don't you come up to Ukijima?
This is my first time to Ukijima.
Wow!
Nope, not at all!
kanaete yo kitto aoi tori the bluebird will make it come true.
It's lovely, isn't it...
I'm sure it will.
W-Wha?!
Farewell, yo!
Ehh?
Somehow, this scenery makes me feel like hurrying home.
Who are you?
Maybe her parents are really old?
Eh? Ah, we should go that way?
Yeah!
Fish?
It might be something from long ago.
This base excavated more water than expected...
And the people who were here?
Come, come! I've found something, yo!
When that happens, it will be like Allen has come back to me.
Ah, don't tell me you forgot that today was our wedding anniversary.
That's why we are excavating the water."
I believe in those words.
They're really big feelings.
Oops!
I'm sure kindness and excitement are delivered at the same time...
kaze no yuku michi ga The direction the wind is taking.
Is pasta okay for dinner?
Once you're done there, could I get you to go to the bakery for me?
nee tsutae you Hey, tell me...
That Undeliverable Letter...
this was the only method of contacting someone over a long distance.
Thank you very much.
What's wrong with that waterway, President Aria?
I'm sorry, not yet.
Eh?
I'm glad.
Well, I'm counting on you.
A gift.
My my my!
I know the approximate location.
Huh? The other is... a foot massager?
It's okay.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I think there's definitely someone waiting for this letter.
Mental preparations, okay?
Okay!
Eh? You're going to quit being an undine?!
If you believe in your dreams, they come true, yo!
Woody-san, what's that?
Huh?
Don't give up!
and once it no longer had a destination, it became a lost letter.
Eh?
As you can see, I'm fine.
But that's impossible.
I couldn't get to that place.
koetekuwa kitto RAINBOW overflows and forms a rainbow.
Ehh?
But all of a sudden it changes to, "It would be nice if they existed."
All right! Wait for me!
Huh? That way?
No, it has to be this way... or not?
I saw your gondola on the beach, so I thought I might meet you.
I was attracted by the name "Neverland."
What's wrong?
Yep, that's impossible.
To think you two also got an invitation...
The thing that makes your blood boil and skin crawl?
Of course.
Huh?
Wait!
it means we can train you to death as much as we like!
If you're not motivated, we can go home!
Is Athena-san your senior?
Wow, I would have liked to meet her.
Be aware of your balance, and row!
Hey, don't forget your balance! Your balance!
You're not getting any better.
I'm falling!
Yes.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
My hands are full of blisters... Poor me.
Well then, it's lunch time!
Umm... What kind of intensive training do we have after this?
so this will be my first time going into one!
Alicia-san! Thank you very much!
there are many, many wonderful places like this that haven't been found yet.
Do you want to go for a walk under the sea?
Sure!
Yeah.
Maybe I've caught your habit of being amused by anything...
It was when I went to the pool with my family.
Aika-chan do you have--
We have grilled rice balls for later.
Haven't you heard about Akira-san's grilled rice balls?
You're really sexy dynamite!
But when I was older, I knew it was just a fantasy.
That might be true.
That's because you're wonderful, Akari-chan.
It must have been really wonderful, wasn't it...
Wow...
Well, let's go see.
Eh? "Hello"?
I was attracted by the name "Neverland."
What's wrong?
A survival?
The undine party has arrived!
President Aria! Alicia-san!
What's wrong, what's wrong?!
And my name is Alice.
Eek!
I just want to play...
How can this person be having fun?
Listen up! Don't be afraid of falling into the water...
Be aware of your balance, and row!
Akari, bending your back isn't allowed!
You're not getting any better.
I shouldn't have come.
Oh, I'm falling.
Good, Alice. Keep it up!
Aika-chan, I'm going to hit you--
It is!
Ah, yes. It's no longer possible to swim in Man-Home's oceans,
so this will be my first time going into one!
How was it?
There were so many colors, it was like I was flying through the sky...
Yeah.
It's good when there's nothing around as well, isn't it...
Maybe I lost it while swimming.
This and this too!
Yeah, it's almost artistic.
Of course not.
My my my my.
No, I was just joking!
All right!
You forget lots of things, don't you...
It's an unreal world.
Eh?
Next time: "That Thing You Want to Protect..."
Ehh?
I wanted Mom and Dad to eat something yummy,
Alice-chan, Alice-chan!
She had a really, really pretty voice, didn't she?
Alice-chan, could it be that you're in a bad mood?
Did something happen?
Unlike the right hand, it's completely incapable of writing since it can't even hold chopsticks.
Umm, how is that...
It's really problematic!
Eh?
It's just what you'd expect from Orange Planet, the top undine business.
This is my room.
unfortunately she's on a business trip.
That's why I asked you.
Don't cry, Maa-kun.
We're the ones that are surprised.
Excuse me for intruding,
I'm Mizunashi Akari of Aria Company.
and frequently spills drinks.
Here, please.
Maa-kun, food time.
Please take it easy, Senpai, okay?
Maa-kun?
Akari-senpai!
I'm glad you found him.
It's really exciting, isn't it...
karada no naka hodokete yuku yo I can feel my body relaxing.
That's why I'm in the middle of the "Left Hand Punishment Campaign."
It leaves everything up to the right hand,
Aside from that,
I would have asked Aika-senpai if she was around, but...
Ah, that surprised me!
I'm Mizunashi Akari of Aria Company.
Canzone: Italian for "Song."
Huh?
Sweet!
Maa-kun, food time.
I'm glad.
Akari-senpai, you have the day off today, don't you?
Ah, where's Maa-kun?
and we opened the locker...
Maa-kun!
And he left me a memo...
is what it said.
mizube ni utsuru itsumono keshiki The usual scenery reflected in the water,
habataite itsuka aoi tori One day the blue bird will be flapping its wings.
You won't be so happy about that later.
Becoming a Pro is a very tough thing to do!
We're going to start with practical training. Are you three ready?
Gah!
Either way, make sure you do it gracefully.
Wow, lucky!
This is Aria Company's President Aria.
This is Orange Planet's President Maa.
"President"?
Fenice?
The opera is expensive, right?
Gallery seating is available, so you can enjoy the opera at a lower price.
Since he rode from the first station, he would be sitting, but...
It might be similar to your husband.
Well then, we must say goodbye here at Marco Polo Square.
Please do your best!
What are you doing calling out to a friend while you're working?
Don't forget there is a speed limit for gondolas!
Yep, your rowing is impressive.
It's good.
Yes! Mizunashi Akari, starting!
Ah, Aika-chan, it doesn't look like we can get through this way, either.
Instead of saying that, why don't you tell them what to do?
And we have customers who are on their honeymoon, don't we...
It seems to be coming from behind this door.
I wonder if you can pass through here with a gondola...
Stop, Akari!
Excuse me a moment.
All right!
Thank god!
Don't call me that!
Hey!
Eat up before it gets cold.
to make up for getting really angry at you, she really accepts you.
Next time is a double feature!
I got scolded by Mom yesterday.
All right...
I'd rather be instructed by Alicia-san.
You can use the leg you have on the deck as a brace,
and is extremely popular among female customers."
Watch out!
Geez.
Yes.
What, what?
I'm sorry to startle you.
"President"?
"Blue-eyed cats are guardians of fortune, and...
Let's see... "Neo-Venezia has many festivals and events..."
Come. Your hand, please.
As the customers.
Akari, you're first!
Sure, yo!
Akari...
Don't forget there is a speed limit for gondolas!
But... a low voice like that won't reach the boat around the corner.
It's another corner.
Gondola coming through.
Gondola coming through.
Alicia-san!
My my.
Here you go.
Newlywed-san, what are you doing falling for another woman?
Anyone would fall for her after seeing Alicia-san's photo in this magazine...
All right, we'll go back to the training, too.
Eh?
The most difficult time for us undines is during this season.
W-W-W-What should we do?
And we have customers who are on their honeymoon, don't we...
President Maa...
It's very weak, but there seems to be a current.
Keep going straight, Akari.
All right!
Stop calling me that!
That's not it.
because I think she truly cares for them.
to make up for getting really angry at you, she really accepts you.
Ai-chan...
koetekuwa kitto RAINBOW overflows and forms a rainbow.
I don't know. I'm not really sure myself.
I'm sorry, could I get you to move for a moment?
Okay!
Whaa?!
Akari-san,
Ai-chan, President Aria is fascinated by a hero at the moment!
My my my.
so we don't feel the effects of the seasons...
Ah, thank goodness.
All right, let's go.
Err, what are you doing in that weird costume, President Aria?
Are you okay?
That's good, that's good!
Ah, you picked them up.
Well then, why not have another go?
I'm going to look for him!
or I'll leave you behind.
Join us for a fabulous time!
President Aria.
My my my.
Look at this, Akari-chan.
It seems like President Aria is out.
Maybe he couldn't get down?
My my my.
THREE - YOUR IDENTITY MUST NOT BE KNOWN.
It's been a while since you've been above ground.
Ah, thank goodness.
When I participated in the Circus class just over there,
All of them!
Well then, why not have another go?
THE DOLL GOT DIRTY
OF ALL THE SUNSETS SEEN BEFORE.
Just kidding.
kiite shiawase no uta wa Listen, it's a song of happiness
or I'll leave you behind.
If I'm going to grow old,
I want to be the kind of grandma that everyone looks at admiringly, no matter how old I am!
Now it's Neo-Venezia's turn to change into the colors of autumn.
My dream is...
but one day also the Legendary Great Fairy,
That's right!
Ehhh?!
Alicia-san, please help us!
"We"...?
Hmm, let's see...
And so, the three of us got a special break,
She's a living legend!
Pleased to meet you, Great Grandmother.
Don't you two understand?
This is just like handling a customer's belongings carefully!
Unlike Man-Home, this is Grandma's hand-tended field.
It was really delicious!
Wow!
There's so much I want to ask...
So what? Shuddup!
Aika-chan, my face...
Because Neo-Venezia is a city,
Yep, that's it.
But if that's it, what do you do in hard or sad times?
I want to become a wonderful woman like her one day!
Because Akari-san's smile shines just as much as the stars in the night sky.
They're really rejuvenating, aren't they...
I'm sure you'll be fine, Aika-chan!
That Star-like Fairy...
nee mitsuke you Hey, let's find
mada shiranai takara mono wo the undiscovered treasure...
Should we... be doing... this?
Yeah! This is wrong, just wrong!
but one day also the Legendary Great Fairy,
and become the number one undine star with my name eternally recorded in Aqua's history!
Don't tell me you don't know?!
I've heard she was twice as good as any other undine.
Ohhh.
Well, why don't you ask her directly?
and went to see the now retired Legendary Great Fairy, but...
She's a living legend!
Okay?
Aika-chan, you're speaking strangely...
We will overcome any rigorous training, so...
Wow, there are lots of fallen chestnuts!
Eh? Lots?
Yes, yes.
Wow!
Ehh?
Thanks for the food.
It's a bath heated by firewood.
You have really sensitive skin, don't you, Aika-chan...
It's really sensitive.
Here, a dressing gown.
Ah, thank you very much.
Umm, Grandma, I have a request!
Please pass down your precious advice on how to become a great Prima!
The way she effortlessly handles the oar,
and her awesome boat control technique...
I believe she is the greatest undine of the present age.
the reason she's reached the position she is in today lies elsewhere.
She is an expert at enjoying everything.
Enjoying?
Is... that it?
You can change them inside yourself,
Grandma really is an amazing person.
I want to become a wonderful woman like her one day!
mitsuketano kawaranu omoi wo You find an unchanging emotion.
habataite itsuka aoi tori One day the blue bird will be flapping its wings.
Hot springs?
It's like a huge bath.
I gotta get up...
Even with gloves on, it's really cold.
What are you doing?!
Akari-chan.
During spring they hide behind the leaves of the Japanese Ash,
Wow!
Why don't we take this one back with us before they get there?
My my, you have a lot of shopping to do, don't you...
Nah, when it's winter we get busy too,
Wow, Aqua is usually much colder, isn't it...
That's right.
I will accompany you.
All right!
I don't have to bring Alicia-san, she's--
Yeah...
I'm sorry for leaving the booking up to you, Aika-chan.
Eh? Ah!
Wait.
Slow and clumsy girls aren't allowed.
Yep. Different, isn't it?
and instead of my loud, harsh senior, there's Alicia-san.
That's right.
This way.
But, but...
It'd be a waste not to swim when it's this big.
Alicia-san?
It has a sweet smell.
Your guests have arrived.
Geh!
You're pretty good.
Snow?
It's okay. I'm sure you'll meet up next winter.
I'm glad.
Why don't we go back inside?
As Primas, we'll be independent.
When that happens, we won't...
Of course.
Be careful not to catch a cold, okay?
I gotta get up...
miagereba hibiki dasu If you look up, you will hear the echo
You'll warm up again as soon as you start moving.
It's the season to use the fireplace again, isn't it...
they return to the Japanese Ash trees again to bring on winter.
That's why you can only see them like this in this period just before winter starts.
Let's buy a little more food than usual.
Yes!
My my, you have a lot of shopping to do, don't you...
All right, even though it's busy, I'm gonna do my best this winter too!
Goodbye.
What about you, Alice-chan?
What should I bring to the hot springs?
Ehh? What do you mean?
Although it's just Genmaicha.
Genmaicha: Roasted Rice Tea, green tea with roasted brown rice.
Y-Yes.
Eh? Ah, well...
Wait.
Eh? Ah!
It really soaks into you.
Morning.
Ah, it's already this time.
Normally we would have finished our tasks and be preparing dinner, wouldn't we?
That's right.
Is it okay to take it so easy?
I think I can start liking winter!
Yeah...
Alicia-san?
It's the speciality here.
I've really enjoyed it.
Heaven... into Hell.
Eh?
Snowflies?
They've gone, haven't they...
When that happens, we won't...
I'm curious now...
The time we share now is really...
and the sky is full of lead-colored clouds.
Alicia-san, I'm back!
She's treating it like it's her own company.
My my my! Athena-chan is very considerate, isn't she...
Ah.
these two would never get around doing anything.
I guess practicing with people from your own company would be better...
She was laughing?!
Since Aria Company always liked to keep things on a small scale,
while giving some excuse.
Wow...
I'm okay.
My my.
Well, you don't seem to care much for rumors.
Huh?
Your arms.
That's just like her junior.
Okay, next is Athena. Give it a go.
Umm, to your right, wait, left...
Gondola coming through.
My my my.
One day we're going to have to sing in front of customers.
It was fun back then, wasn't it...
One day...
At some point, a day like that will come for us too, won't it...
Once we become professional undines,
Alice-chan...
Certainly I don't think you'll be able to stay as you are now...
That's right, isn't it...
Embarrassing...
you'll never run out of fun things.
And here's one point of advice...
I want extra cream.
Hey!
Don't you feel the same, Ai-chan?
Next time: "That Gentle Wish..."
It's unusually chilly today.
Those Orange Days...
Thank you, please excuse me.
No, there's no problem at all, but...
I'll carry these out.
Yes! Very much!
Alicia! We're in trouble!
Damn you! No matter who you are, I won't give up the number one position in our generation!
It happens all the time.
Well, you don't seem to care much for rumors.
My my my!
From that point on, we started practicing with Athena-chan,
The Pisani-Moretta Palace is also known as a hall to hold masked balls.
Ah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
My my, I'm first?
Hey!
It was fun back then, wasn't it...
How long has it been since we've had Alicia's cocoa with fresh cream like this...
Embarrassing...
If we were caught up in the fun of the past,
I'm sure things that are truly fun can't be compared.
I agree!
Ehh? I didn't say anything, Aika-chan.
te wo tsunagu tsuyosa wo kono mama shinjiteru I can keep believing in the strength of holding hands...
jasumin no hana no kaori sotto yureta nara ...if you gently release the fragrance of the jasmine flower.
Lots of things change with the flow of time... But there are things that never change.
Preview
When I go out with President Aria,
we sometimes end up going to mysterious and wonderful places!
Is this Neo-Venezia?
Really?
Eh?
Ah, I'm sorry for being so loud.
They're strange clothes, aren't they...
I knew it!
Sure!
Ah, that's my cat's name.
He's a bit shy...
Have you ever had someone say that to you?
Of course.
I'll make Cabbage Rolls.
Thanks.
Eh? Isn't that common sense on Aqua?
Probably.
Oh, I see.
No matter what happens now, it'll stand firm!
It's okay. It's only slightly burnt after all.
Yep, it's delicious.
That's right.
and I bought a new card recorder... but I dropped it twice!
Huh?
Ah... Akiko-san, you're a school teacher?
No, we don't know yet.
Right, Sensei?
Yep.
It's okay.
That's right.
Me too.
Avvenire means "future," doesn't it?
No, not really.
Why are the waterways dry?
Eh?
but now there's no one who wants to go.
This is it, isn't it...
Ah, that's right. The picture from the book...
Someone's there.
And... what's an "undine"?
Yes, from Man-Home.
so I don't have anything yet.
Ah, that's my cat's name.
Have you ever had someone say that to you?
Ah, no reason.
What do you think?
Even though it's small, it tastes good.
The truth is I've only been on Aqua just over a year and a half myself,
I'm really sorry!
Yep, it's delicious.
It'd be a huge shock if I couldn't take any pictures.
this is the most certain way of communicating over a long distance.
Yep, it will.
Yep, there will be.
It'll be okay.
Right, Sensei?
A cat?
It's an ancient imaginary beast from Man-Home.
It's okay.
This city will finally be lively!
That's right. Although I never would've imagined making a wooden deck on Man-Home myself.
That's right.
The people trying to make a place overflowing with happiness while not giving up after many failures.
And as if to answer to those feelings, many miracles occur...
The water's coming!
Amazing.
hikaru houseki mitai yubisaki ni Your fingertips are like shining jewels,
The beginning of all the wonderful events.

I wonder why the water can warm your heart so much...
Yes.
Stay well, Akiko-san.

I'm thankful for the miracle of meeting you this year.
that the festivities become really amazing!
Because of Akari-san's e-mails.
Beans?
it's custom to always eat a bean dish at the end of the year,
Getting along?! Hey!
What is it?
Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed.
Oh my my, President Aria. I'm glad you're in high spirits.
It's been a while, Grandma.
That's the sixth, Akari-san.
Ai-chan?
Hey, Pigtails!
It felt kinda familiar.
Akari-senpai and Ai-chan are late, aren't they...
Something to throw?
The countdown is about to start, isn't it...
When I think about this year, which shone like a treasure to me, is going to end...
Embarrassing...
Auguri! Boun Anno!
I just woke up, too.
Ah, she's cute!
My my.
What color it will become, is up to us.
Yeah, see you.
The baby has gotten much bigger since we saw it last time in the photo, hasn't it...
Huh? Both?
with thanks from all my heart...
everything wonderful that you hold close to your heart will never disappear.
clear skies, with occasional snow.
Every single day of the second year that I've spent on Aqua has shined like a treasure.
What am I going to do, Alicia-san?
Yay! Long time no see, President Aria!
My my my.
We can spend New Year's Eve together, then!
Because of Akari-san's e-mails.
Since you borrow money from him.
That's a tourist gift. They're pretty popular.
That's four now.
Grandma!
Ai-chan?
Let's go, Ai-chan.
Yeah, probably.
How mysterious...
Yes.
They'll return in time.
The countdown is about to start, isn't it...
Yeah.
"Auguri" is a shout of good wishes, and...
Akari-san!
I hope this year will be a wonderful year, too.
Feeling the sun with your whole body...
We need a good sleep.
We're going to meet up with Atsui-san in the afternoon, right?
She was really cute.
To the people living in my generation on this wonderful planet...
and to those of you I'm yet to meet...

Since the day I arrived on Aqua, 20 months have flown by.
Yes...
Thats right.
Its difficult, isnt it?
Cmon, hurry up and get off.
Because youre my friend.
Umm, Aika-chan, isnt it okay to be her friend?
Its rocking after all.
At first I came here because I admired the cool Undines.
Thats all it was, but now I like Aqua and Neo-Venezia.
the feelings of the people who wanted to build a city gave birth to...
Ive eaten them at home before and didnt really like them...
I dunno, being a free rider even though she has money... isnt that a bit bad?
Well then, lets go!
Here I go.
Okay.
Amazing, amazing!
Alicia-san.
Thank you very much, Alicia-san.
I thought if I came for myself I would like it, so I asked Mom and Dad.
But the places they took me were all boring.
When I get back, Ill boast right back at my sister.
It too might be a miracle for hate to turn into love.
More importantly, are you really leaving today?
Really? Ai-chan!
An important person...
egao ga sugu koboreru
Take care of it, Akari-chan.
why do you interfere, Pigtails?
Im very busy.
Not only is it just as I imagined, its more; its love at first sight!
Umm, I want to ride Alicia-sans gondola...
Well, hurry up and lets go.
Wha...
Do you like gondolas?
Because there are no cars, you have to walk everywhere.
Ai.
Uhno...
Then can you please row?
Huh? Why should I?
Thats right! Aika-chan, lets go see Alicia-san.
You really love Alicia-san, dont you, Aika-chan?
Buttered potato?
But its not like we can accept money either.
Yeah!
Wouldnt it be better if the more skilled person rowed?
Amazing, amazing!
Ai-chan, you wanted to meet Alicia-san, didnt you?
You were the one who called this morning, right?
But Im glad I rode it today!
I dont think your sister was boasting...
Really? Ai-chan!
The newlyweds who started fighting in the gondola...
Yes, but it was troublesome back then.
demo furidashita ame mo
ki ni shinai zutto soba ni iru kara
chiisana hikari hoshi ni negai wo
I think I understand why they want to take it easy.
Weve got a problem!
Yup!
On that special day...
Yup, so Ill leave things to you, Akari-chan.
Lets walk today!
and if you do something different from the norm on a day thats different from the norm,
Splash, splash...
splishity-splash!
Huh? I dont think this is the right street.
Normally, people take it easy at home today.
Embarrassing remarks arent allowed!
But going out in a gondola on a day like this
The partner in the comedian combo?
Do you think that someone like you can become a professional Undine by being sentimental and spoiled?
What happens if you arent able to go back
Wow, this is amazing!
but Dont go to bed without brushing your teeth!
Really?
Thats right. So because I love Alicia-san, shes jealous.
Eh?
Hello there.
I dont think Alicia-san remembers...
Is anyone home?
Eek!
Gah!
Or else Ill sink you in the Neo-Adriatic Sea!
Three!
Ah sorry, President Aria!
Alicia, why are you here?
My my.
Eh? Why did it turn out like this?
I wonder what will happen.
Sure.
Okay.
I hate that part of you!
It was a race I couldve won.
Wish upon a small shining star,
Next time: With that transparent girl...
Just as expected, Aika-chan!
Acqua alta?
saa kogidasou hikaru nami e
We soon break into a smiles.
If Aquas blue sky was reflected in the water, would the entire town be sky blue?
But because of Akari-sans e-mail, a blue sky has spread through my heart.
President Arias food ran out, so could you go out and get some more?
Slowly, slowly...
Whew, that was sudden.
Its really coming down...
Huh? Isnt that kitty cat...
Eh? No way!
Eh?
Why do Undine companies have cats with aquamarine eyes as their president?
I wonder who first decided that having a blue-eyed cat as president was a symbol of assurance.
You dont have to say it like
What?
If it were Alicia-san, she wouldnt unmercifully yell at me without asking why!
Yeah.
Ah, yes. Ill go.
Even if shes called one of the Three Water Fairies with Alicia-san and Orange Planets Athena-san,
My my my, you mustve really liked Aika-chans cooked rice.
you never see them together, do you?
Thats right. So because I love Alicia-san, shes jealous.
You really do love Alicia-san, dont you, Aika-chan.
Ah!
and stayed with me until the sun went down.
My my.
If you have something to say to me, Ill listen.
My?
Youve always been like that!
Ill do it too, Ill do it too, Ill do it too!
Not allowed! Not allowed!
Eh? Why did it turn out like this?
Want some tea?
Even if I have to backward-row, do I have to win?
Walnut bread?
Then, um, what about the race?
Because she admires you, she might really do her best.
I hate that part of you!
Suwa!
Safe!
My my!
te no hira no ue ni sotto noseta
ki ni shinai zutto soba ni iru kara
kanaete yo kitto aoitori
On days like this, you just quietly do some easy practice.
But if you can take the glittering oar in your hands,
capture the waves and skillfully ride the current,
But since its a gift for Alicia-san, theres no helping it.
But you didnt need to pick this many!
The flowers are your customers, arent they?
Ehh?
Good morning.
Excuse us, could we...?
Shes said to be a genius at handling an oar.
Wow...
She really works hard, doesnt she.
So you like this city too, dont you, Undine-san?
Yes.
But...
This is the Marco Polo International Spaceport.
Umm... Youve been saying Pigtails, Pigtails for a while now.
Ukijima: Floating island.
So that everyone on Aqua can live in the same environment as Man-Home,
Yes, because of us, this land is protected.
All right, as a reward for saying something good, you can guide me around some more, Pigtails.
Huh? Well...
You look good, lil bro.
Well then, guide me to the ropeway.
Not fighting the current...
Its like Ive become a bird and Im flying through the sky.
and lightened my heart... could I become one with the wind too?
I was asked to deliver a letter!
Why are you so happy?

The fact that youre a Pair means youre still a trainee?
Fourteen.
Hey hey, stop, stop!
They only opened for business 10 years ago, but they already have over 100 establishments like we do.
Are you going to school now?
Welcome!
What a lovely gift!
Eh? Ah, her!
Shes said to be a genius at handling an oar.
President, you dont have to be scared.
Not at all, this is nothing,
because Alicia-san is with us.
if she crashes into the bank or capsizes, I wont mind!
Do you have the day off from your Salamander job?
Yeah, I suppose.
About 150 years ago.
Ah, thank you!
Umm... Youve been saying Pigtails, Pigtails for a while now.
This person is the same.
Embarrassing remark...
Alice-chan, are you okay for time?
RReally?
Im late... Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You!
It looks like youre a superb Undine above the rest.
the secret behind this persons smile.
Not at all.
Be thankful and eat.
Its amazing.
Becoming one with the wind would feel good, wouldnt it?
If I did...
I might be able to fly in the sky too.
slowly warming your kindness.

I was asked to deliver a letter!
Next time: That undeliverable letter...
Did you see that?
Farewell!
Presented by Project79068
While it rocks to the sound of the waves,
Yes.
My my, will you go for me too, President Aria?
Who are you?
Eh? Me?
Sure thing.
Youre the only one who has noticed me.
I need it delivered.
Mailman-san, how did it go?
What does that mean?
Hmm, thats impossible, though...
But most likely, there wont be anyone living there.
But its not a distance you can travel by gondola.
Thank you very much.
Well, here it is.
Yes.
Okay!
Yup, about another hour to go!
It really is a long way away.
That would be business rivalry!
Our job is to help by riding this guy and delivering treasured feelings.
Huh?
Maybe he isnt here anymore...
Whats wrong, Alicia-san?
This base dug up more water than expected,
I wonder why that girl had such a letter.
Only a little more until the predicted levels.
Aqua will be a planet overflowing with happiness one day.
Even though there are a lot of hard times now,
Im sure in our childrens time, Aqua will be overflowing with laughter.
What am I going to do with you.
So, I want to at least deliver my heart to you.
Ive just delivered it.
Im glad you were able to deliver those treasured feelings, Akari-san.
slowly warming your kindness.
Well pass over many rainbows.
The two of us, over the rainbow.
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
I wonder if us Undines can do that too.
Ai-chan, not only does Neo-Venezia have water fairies and fire keepers,
I can feel my body relaxing.
Yes?
and take me to your side, Undine?
Are you okay?
Hmm, its not here. I wonder if this address is wrong.
Since Neo-Venezia still has mailmen like us around,
What a bright sun.
You promised me...
Youre the only one who has noticed me.
My my my!
My my my!
But most likely, there wont be anyone living there.
But its not a distance you can travel by gondola.
No matter how many hours it will take.
Woody-san, excuse me!
I have a favor to ask!
Please deliver me!
Its okay.
Akari!
Leave it to me!
Well then, take off!
Eh? Youre going to quit being an Undine?!
I think it would be nice if Undines could do that too.
It looks like the Kai Tak Base has sunk into the sea.
Dont give up! Lets go look for some kind of clue!
Who could that be?
Alicia-san! President Aria!
That kind of accident wasnt unusual,
I wonder why that girl had such a letter.
The water line has risen quite a lot!
I want this year to be the last wedding anniversary I spend alone.
Im sure in our childrens time, Aqua will be overflowing with laughter.
And then
This is an important message for Allen, so dont play with it!
Aika-chan, Alice-chan, lets go on an adventure!
When you were a child you used to think, They exist for sure!,
It seems like Akari-senpai really believes them even now.
And it says to bring a swimsuit.
Well, lets go and see.
Eh? Alice-chan!
Whats wrong?
I understand. And my name is Alice.
Im falling.
Alicia-san, Akira-san...
Why are you coming all this way?
Can you lend me your oar?
What, you say? Well, getting blisters together, lying together, that kind of thing...
Make sure you eat lots.
you can slack off!
As long as youre good, you can play as much as you want now.
Alicia-san! Thank you very much!
Embarrassing remarks arent allowed!
Lets go, Akari!
One, two...
Maybe Ive caught your habit of being amused by anything?
What?
Ah, thats right, Mom said shed buy me new ones.
Even though its something I forgot long ago, Im remembering it now.
Yeah, its like the craft of an artisan, isnt it?
Grilled rice balls are canceled!
No, I was just joking!
Yeah, yeah!
Look forward to eating them.
You cant sleep?
You cant throw away whats important to you.
Memories that should have been forgotten are still sleeping within me, arent they?
becoming happy, embarrassing, and mysterious feelings.
This island might really be Neverland.
Thats because youre wonderful, Akari-chan.
Eh?
The two of us, over the rainbow.
Wish upon a small shining star,
Handling an oar is really more important than singing!
Mysterious things...
Thats because Akari is a mysterious girl.
The gentle wind brushing against my cheeks...
While it rocks to the sound of the waves,
kaze no yuku michi ga
nee tsutaeyou kono tokimeki
Hello.
You got an invitation as well?
The second shining beach on the right?
Are you saying that seriously?
The beach really is shining!
And its not just any intensive training!
Eek! Im sorry...
Again!
My my...
Yes.
Eh? Really?
I hate to admit it, though.
But its kind of nice, isnt it...
Yeah, this sandwich is good, Alicia.
Make sure you eat lots.
It sure is!
so this is the first time Ive been in the sea!
Make sure you experience the real sea here at Neverland, okay, Akari-chan?
So this is the sea, right?
Ah! In such a tasty place!
We cant lose, can we!
The sea breeze feels good, doesnt it...
The sound of the waves is peaceful, isnt it...
Maybe Ive caught your habit of being amused by anything?
Huh? Akari, your ribbon...
What did I do with the remaining ribbon from the other side?
Would you like some corn?
You have a cats tongue, dont you, Akari-chan?
Ohh! All right!
Havent you heard about Akira-sans grilled rice balls?
Its almost like a mans cooking
Really?
Perhaps the very planet called Aqua might be Neverland.
even if its got nowhere to go.
Wish upon a small shining star,
Unnoticed feelings are hidden in places you cant see.
Akari-san, I made buttered potatoes today.
Alice-chan, Alice-chan!
Come, lets row toward the shining waves.
Its really a disaster.
Should I help you out, since Im older?
If something happened, dont hesitate to tell Big Sis... or not?
Come in.
This is Maa-kun.
Athena-senpai, Ive told you to please knock when entering the room, havent I?
Ah, this is our President Aria.
Gomme syrup: Water saturated with sugar.
She often trips on flat surfaces,
Eh?
that I have to use my left hand at a time like this.
Dont you think it would be okay to talk about Maa-kun, if it were to Athena-senpai?
But youre going to hide him for the whole time while you raise him?
Yeah.
Im glad.
Akari-senpai, you have the day off today, dont you?
Please take it easy, Senpai, okay?
But how long can this go on?
Maa-kun?
And then he ran away...
Then Athena-senpai didnt get rid of him.
Alice-chan...
you sang back then too, didnt you?
I talked to the company...
Eh?
Hmm?
you find unchanging emotions.
one day over the rainbow.
But when you become aware of them,
hoho wo naderu yasashii kaze
Its really a disaster.
egao ga sugu koboreru
Ive come to realize recently just how useless my left hand is.
This is Maa-kun.
Maa-kun!
Are you lonely all by yourself? ...is how it went.
I would have asked Aika-senpai if she was around, but unfortunately shes on a business trip.
Huh? Alice-chan...
Alice-chan, dont you think Athena-senpai will find Maa-kun?
Umm, when did you get this water?
She forgets the most important things,
Here, please.
Why would you go that far?
Yeah.
Maa-kun...
Alice-chan, the left hand might not be that useless after all.
Alice-chan!
Did you find your cat?
Eh?
Eh?
I couldnt even protect Maa-kun.
The left hand was a really big helper!
But because of that, I didnt feel so down, and I was filled with a warm feeling.
one day over the rainbow.
The love that fills my chest gathers and forms a rainbow.
Next time: That wonderful job...
Youre late!
Gah!
Maam, your hand, please.
All right!
Akira-san! Over here!
Akira-san from the long-established Himeya is one of the three great Undines,
Watch out!
Wow, lucky!
Well then, shall we go?
Are you on your honeymoon?
Sir, why not enjoy Neo-Venezia for yourself?
Beyond here is a statue of Maria. Its not in any guidebooks.
and many things that bring out your heart.
Gondola coming through!
Umm, can you guide us around in the afternoon as well?
then why dont you join us for our training?
What are you doing calling out to a friend while youre working?
Okay, next!
Is that the Alicia-san of the Three Water Fairies?
Whatd you come here for, Alicia?
Wow, Im so happy!
I didnt know it would rise so rapidly...
Theres no need to interfere with the training.
its very weak, but there seems to be a current. From over there.
Here I go.
Stop, Akari!
Oh?
Its really big!
Join us for a fabulous time!
If its lunch youre after, we have our own right here.
but I was slow getting ready, and we were late.
nee tsutaeyou kono tokimeki
Yes!
kaze ni notte anata no moto e
Its the real Akira-san!
Come, your hand, please.
Im instructing new Undines today.
Um...
President Maa, thats a no-no.
It might be similar to your husband.
As the customers.
That cant be anything but boring!
Oh?
Eh, ah... I was just suddenly happy...
Gondola coming through!
Is that the Alicia-san of the Three Water Fairies?
Its about break time, right?
Wow, Im so happy!
Lets start from Akari.
The most difficult time for us Undines is during this season.
and the number of bridges that we cant go under doubles.
Yes...
It looks like well have to wait until the water level goes down after all.
No need to lend a hand either.
Its pitch black, isnt it?
Dont call me that!
Suwa!
Umm, youre not going to get mad at us?
She is strict about her juniors,
Akira-san may be really strict,
and they start to shine within me before I know it.
Thats right, itll overflow from your heart every time.
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
That depressed president... That cool hero...
One, two...
Its a perfect chance for Aria Company to do some cleaning!
Presented by Project79068
I can feel my body relaxing.
Come, lets row toward the shining waves.
Hey, tell me, this excitement...
Happily taking presidential actions
He thought they might enjoy his home cooking.
My my my, its okay, Akari-chan.
Its a letter, isnt it?
President Aria has made a new friend.
Do you think I should look around the area?
It must have been really scary, right?
Ai-chan, President Aria is fascinated by a hero at the moment!
The hero appears!!
Young lady, you dropped something! Hey!
an8Do you know of a shop where I can rest and have a nice cup of tea?
I wonder where hes from... is what she thought.
Or a cruel space man?!
So you dont lose to that cat.
Im going to look for him!
an8was the most powerful ever.
Welcome back, President Aria.
The usual scenery reflected in the water,
Thats right, itll overflow from your heart every time.
Eh?
I dont know; Im not really sure myself.
I think I want to know...
While it rocks to the sound of the waves,

We soon break into a smiles.

President Aria.
Cover: Arias Sketchbook
Ribbit?
Its a pretty sunset, isnt it, President Hime?
With nowhere to go, President Aria ended up coming back home.
Okay!
My my my...
My my my.
This?
Err, what are you doing in that weird costume, President Aria?
An evil organization is after our hero?!
Or a cruel space man?!
When I participated in the circus class just over there,
mizube ni utsuru itsumo no keshiki
Wow, thats amazing.
Here you go, Aika-chan.
Well be able to see Grandma soon, wont we?
Akari-chan, Aika-chan, and Alice-chan, yes?
I heard about you from Alicia.
You dont need to be so formal. Please just call me Grandma.
Well, you could collect some chestnuts from the mountain out the back once youve dropped your things off.
This one?!
This will cultivate our ability to find our customers in a crowd!
Were back!
You wanted lots?
Alice-chan is amazing, isnt she!
Umm... ta-da!
Amazing, amazing!
This feels good.
You have really sensitive skin, dont you, Aika-chan?
Its really sensitive.
Youre overreacting, Aika-chan.
Amazing.
Im sure its because Alicia-san put in the effort as Grandmas number one student
Thats right.
Yup, thats it.
Aww, its gone...
Oh my my.
All right! Next time for sure!
Me too.
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
Theyre really rejuvenating, arent they?
Whats wrong, Aika-chan?
When the wind calms down, if you look back...
yuubae ni terasare
kokoro made mo somatte yuku yo
If you look up, it will echo forth,
lets search, Undine.
Yeah! This is wrong, wrong!
Wow...
Its common knowledge for anyone in the water guide industry.
Eh?
she is both my and Alicia-sans great senior!
Being too cheerful isnt allowed! Got it?
Hurry, hurry.
What a superb view!
Its okay, its okay.
I understand, Grandma!
Aika-chan, youre speaking strangely.
Okay, then...
Collect chestnuts?
Wow, youve got lots, Alice-chan!
Ill boil them later, okay?
Yes, yes.
Well then, please dig up some sweet potatoes!
Alice-chan is amazing, isnt she!
Is it ready yet?
Yes!
Finally, the living legends class is going to start!
I can smell the wood.
Theyre all good girls, arent they?
Youll sleep well tonight.
Good night.
Well never become Primas...
Aika-chan, my face...
Its a huge universe!
Youre really nosy.
Things you see, things you hear, things you touch...
Enjoying everything?
Alice-chan?
Ah! Become the number one star! Become the
I want to become a wonderful woman like her one day!
you find unchanging emotions.
sou itsudemo kokoro no naka afurete
The dream you painted will be granted,
the bluebird will one day be flapping its wings.
Hot springs, huh? I wonder what kind of place it is!
Theyre great! They really warm you up!
Theyre really rejuvenating, arent they?
If its cold in the morning, I feel like staying in bed.
When the wind calms down, if you look back...
Hey, lets find...
Its cold...
Alicia-san, Im back!
Yes, since its become quite cold,
Yes?
Ah, whats this?
Thats a snowfly.
Yes, when its winter theyll appear somewhere.
Wow.
we can walk outside like this even in winter, right?
Salamanders are the source of Aquas warmth, arent they?
Thats right.
Yes! I cant wait!
Have you finished work for today?
Im sorry for leaving the booking up to you, Aika-chan.
Well be under your care.
I think I can come to love winter.
Ehh?
Its dark...
Hey, Akari! Thats unladylike!
Geh!
Youre pretty good.
Dont you think this is enough?
In Neo-Venezia, its said that when the snowflies leave, the first snow is coming.
Yes!
In the middle of the changing seasons,
In the sky where I saw the rainbow after the rain,
As Primas, well be independent.
Its like a huge bath.
Huh? You go in with other people.
Thats right.
If its cold in the morning, I feel like staying in bed.
When the wind calms down, if you look back...
kokoro made mo somatte yuku yo
Come, lets row toward the distant future.
We Undines are professionals who fight against various degrees of hot and cold on the harsh waters of our workplace.
All right then, come with us!
Thats right; because the Salamanders are heating up the atmosphere from Ukijima,
Goodbye.
I dont have to bring Alicia-san; shes coming with
All right, Im gonna finish this practice in a flash and go to the hot spring with Alicia-san!
You and that snowfly are dressed smartly, arent you.
Im going to a hot spring for the first time tomorrow.
Itd be nice if waterways in the wintertime were like hot springs too, wouldnt it?
Ah, look at the chimneys!
Oh.
Doesnt this sunset make you yearn for home?
My my. Lets knit President Aria a hat and a scarf too.
Akari-chan, first hold the needle like this.
YYes.
Well then, Im going too!
Its degraded quite a bit from when it was a house,
Theres more back here.
The truth is, on days off like this, I feel like I should be practicing because Im a Single...
but since the cute snowfly is around,
I think I can come to love winter.
Im going to have another bath,
Thats right, why dont we go too?
Were here now.
Wow, it connects to the ocean!
Aika-chan, wait up.
Senpai...
Its kind of like a dream, isnt it?
Thats the truth.
Geh!
It looks like we missed dinner.
Dont you think this is enough?
but to make up for that, there are many wonderful things.
utsuriyuku kisetsu no naka de
Join us for a fabulous time!
What is it, Alice-chan?
Its cold.
Even though its daytime, the sun is being held back,
On such a day, Im sure those silver angels will...
When the wind calms down, if you look back...
Just when I thought today was really cold,
Yes.
Eh? Is that sort of weird?
We just happened to find out that the three of us were free today.
Thanks for waiting!
Thanks.
Wow.
Eh? Really?
She was obviously shy.
I heard its only a matter of time before she becomes a Prima!
Huh?
Are you okay?!
I am Athena.
Ah, Im sorry.
I heard a rumor that theres an amazingly skilled Single at your company...
If you know anything concerning that...
So, if you like, could you tell us the name and something about that amazing Single?
Ah, I really ate a lot!
Huh?
So you never met that rumored Single?
My my my.
Yes.
My my, Im first?
Okay, its embarrassing, but Ill sing a song.
I see, so it was you!
it kind of makes you think it isnt true, doesnt it?
One day...
lots of small, fun things come and go.
Ah, why dont we all eat the walnut bread you brought?
Ah, President Aria is awake.
See ya then.
Good night!
and things that are precious because they dont change...
you find unchanging emotions.
When Im curious about something, I cant swallow my food.
Aww!
Just when I thought today was really cold,
Gah!
Thanks for doing your combined training, even in this cold.
Yes.
Thanks.
Is something wrong?
By the way, theres something Id like to ask you...
If you know anything concerning that...
My my.
So it ended without finding out anything about the rumored Single?
Are you saying Ill turn into a cow?
What good is it being embarrassed?
Give it your best.
That was amazing, Athena-chan!
You were the rumored Single?!
I wont be able to practice with Akari-senpai and Aika-senpai every day or see them like I do now, will I?
Its true; I dont think youll be able to stay as you are now,
And heres one point of advice:
Akari, take care of Akira-san and the others.
Yes?
Yeah.
te wo tsunagu tsuyosa wo kono mama shinjiteru

Something irreplaceable must be overflowing from the bottom of my heart.
Its because youre here that it shines so bright.
along with the gently flowing time...
utsuriyuku kisetsu no naka de
habataite itsuka aoitori
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
Its Aqua... isnt it?
Since its nothing but a simple bridge.
Ah, thats right, the picture from the book.
No, I dont...
Thank you.
Umm...
I built this wooden deck myself.
On warm days I have tea here.
Welcome to the Sunny Caf, where the warming sun hits.
Of course.
No matter what happens now, itll stand firm!
I got your hopes up, and it turned out like this.
Sure. Its homemade, isnt it?
This one means...
I guide people around the city in a gondola.
Eh? Ah, well, were open but not getting business at the moment.
This side of the bridge?
Thats right! I wanted to take a picture of the water coming,
This is Mizunashi Akari-san.
Tickling isnt allowed!
I wonder. Im not getting my hopes up.
Yes?
Delicious bakeries, small cafs, and cute florists...
Lots of shops will be possible, wont they?
Thats right. Although I never wouldve imagined making a wooden deck on Man-Home myself.
Ah, thats it.
A handmade planet?
and we end up with the current Aqua, dont we?
I feel like weve finally been allowed to live on this planet.
want to reach even the most distant places.
Aqua is going to be a planet living in happiness, isnt it?
Akari-chan sure is late.
Alicia-san, Im home.
Yes.
Hold me forever, okay?
because Ill always be by your side.
Why are the waterways dry?
Ai-chan, right now its like the ordinary city of Neo-Venezia has makeup on  its so white!
Yes! The oldest bridge in Neo-Venezia.
Even if its just an old bridge to others,
Presented by Project79068
There it is, President Aria!
Yup, this is it.
And the clouds have suddenly cleared up, havent they?
Ah, Im sorry for being so loud.
Yes, Im an Undine from that company.
And whats an Undine?
No, I dont...
We both glow warmly, and are fated to become the light that shines over Aqua from now on.
We welcome people who wish to refresh their heart, what do you think?
Cute, isnt it?
Wow...
Eh? Isnt that common sense on Aqua?
Were even more similar, arent we?
It looks like its okay
Dont you smell something strange?
I got your hopes up, and it turned out like this.
I baked it this morning.
DDont worry about it.
I guide people around the city in a gondola.
And the water is finally coming.
This is...
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting!
Yes.
The water will be here soon.
Yup, it will.
Itll be okay.
Ah, pleased to meet you, Im Mizunashi Akari!
Dont act so high and mighty, Gachamon.
Did I?
Thats right.
Its water!
Its like its even slowly filling up my heart too.
I wonder why the water can warm your heart so much.
Aqua is going to be a planet living in happiness, isnt it?
tasogare no yuuhi ni kurumarete itai kara

Alicia-san, Im home.
It sits quietly on the palm of my hand,
demo furidashita ame mo
ki ni shinai zutto soba ni iru kara
because Ill always be by your side.
ikutsumo no niji koete yukeru yo
Its sad when you think about it that way,
My second New Years Eve on Aqua has come.
Hey, long time no see, President Aria!
The bright light overflows onto the waterside.
We can spend New Years Eve together, then!
Whys this?
Akari-san, Akatsuki-san is pretty cool, isnt he?
Theyre beans made from Neo-Venezian glass.
Yup!
Old man, huh...
See ya, ladies.
Youre Akira-san, the demon instructor.
Thats four now.
Akari! What kind of e-mails have you been sending Ai-chan?!
You think?
Im glad to see youre all getting on as always.
Good evening, Ai-chan.
Hey, Pigtails, where are you going?
Its okay. Look.
Its said that cats are animals that connect the past and present.
How mysterious. It felt kinda familiar.
I knew it, theres a hole.
I wonder if theyre okay.
Where have you been?
We Undines use this.
Yeah.
Embarrassing...
Nove!
Yeah, Ai-chan!
Tre!
Due!
I hope this year will be a wonderful year too.
It sits quietly on the palm of my hand,
In my heart, love always overflows and forms a rainbow.
Clear skies with occasional snow.
Even though its cold, the air feels nice, doesnt it?
What is it, Akari-chan?
Can it ride the wind,
Ah, Akatsukin...
Even though its a familiar scene,
Akari-san, I came!
Salamanders are heroes of justice!
Im getting encounters with the people from Akari-sans e-mails.
Arent you glad?
OOld man?
Well, Im gonna go.
Youre Akira-san, the demon instructor.
Um, Id like to ask a question...
Okay, stop there.
Its been a while.
Youre here.
My my, what a cute little lady.
Ai-chan, are you okay?
YYeah, Im fine.
Im sorry; we lost sight of President Aria.
This place is...
Yeah, probably.
Theyll return in time.
Were back.
Aqua.
We Undines use this.
Wonderful encounters, and irreplaceable precious times...
Whats wrong, Akari-chan?
Embarrassing...
Good morning, Akari-chan, Ai-chan.
Pleased to meet you; whats your name?
Im sure it will.
Lets meet again.
The baby has gotten much bigger from when we saw her in the photo, hasnt she?
Akari-chan... Auguri, Buon Anno.
And to those of you Im yet to meet...
Auguri, Buon Anno!
When you hear all these little sounds,
Yes, it is, as long as you have those sideburns.
"A-ka-ri."
This is Aqua... This city is Neo-Venezia.
I'm afraid she's busy today. I'm very sorry.
Um...
Um... Excuse me...
But, I'm only a journeyman. I can't take on customers.
Help me.
Right...
Ah...
Do you like gondolas?
Wait... Is this the girl who called before?
Ai.
Come on, hurry up and get off.
Let's see... it's been 150 years since Aqua was terraformed to allow people to live here.
Neo-Venezia is modeled after the city of Venice, which originally existed on Manhome...
Oh.
Besides, a freeloader shouldn't get that much service.
"Baked potato"?
It tasted really good!
Okay, just hold her straight!
Gotcha!
Uh, this girl's name is Ai.
My big sister came here on her honeymoon.
She's a lot older than you, huh?
Yeah, and that's why she always treats me like a little kid.
Maybe she was just trying to tell you about Aqua.
Now I sort of want to hear her talk about Aqua.
Maybe hate turning into love is a miracle, too.
E-mail me, okay?
That's okay.
Heh, heh.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
That's right. That's an important attitude to have if you want to be a Prima Undine.
So why won't she go easy on me for a change?
but I'd like to see Neo-Venezia like that, too.
I can't see the sky from my room,
Uh-oh.
This isn't working!
Huh?
The Acqua Alta is really something else!
Pardon the intrusion.
Okay, pop quiz!
Thank you.
...to appoint a blue-eyed cat as their company president.
Yeah, I wonder.
Push-ups, sit-ups. Hindu squats! You can do something, right?
Wow, that's strict.
So, you're the other half of the comedy duo.
Not only did a Single like you take along a customer on her own,
Always laughing frivolously, like-
Aika, maybe you should calm down a little.
Uh, right. I'm going.
My, my, my, my...
Salt.
Sorry for the wait.
Man, if Akira was here, she'd be all...
Yes! You know that very well, Aika.
I can't remember why, but I was feeling really down.
Hello there.
Alicia was still just a Single back then.
Well? Feeling better now?
The moment I decided I was going to be an Undine.
Two!
Let's go, Aika. If you hang around here, you'll start going "my, my" too.
My, my.
Oh my.
My, my! Hee-hee!
Not allowed!
What's so fine about it?!
Didn't I say that wasn't allowed?
I'm basically the heir to Himeya.
I never knew there was such a pretty square here.
and then one day, you discover a different side of her.
I wonder.
She's a good kid.
So? Why have you both wandered back, acting all chummy?
You're really obnoxious.
We need harder practice to get better!
This is Aika from Himeya. How do you do?
Let's bring some of those flowers back for Alicia.
I can see where I'm going.
Look, President Aria!
Huh?
If only I really could become the wind... I could spread this scent all over Neo-Venezia.
Didn't I just say no sappy lines allowed?
You're still growing, so you must be hungry after training, right?
They've got a lot of employees, too.
Oh! She saw us! Now what?
You made some of the younger girls cry?
But...
Come on, let's get home and have these as a snack!
Hey there, Sideburns.
Um, Akatsuki?
Okay, then what else would you call these fine sideburns?
We can both practice giving a tour to Akatsuki!
Please turn to your right.
Further into the plaza is a place that's famous for the invention of caf au lait-
Isn't it rude of you to keep calling her Sideburns like that?
Shouldn't you be doing homework?
But it's vital that I see him!
Take that old man over there.
You're lookin' well, little brother!
Akatsuki, this is your big brother?
The secret of her smile.
Sure!
Use the water as best you can.
Akari.
Huh?
I've got employee tickets.
Neither have I.
When I rode in your gondola, my chest was filled with the smell of salt.
I was asked to deliver a letter!
Unless they're really big feelings.
Yay!
Woody, are you done with work for the day?
This is the sort of scene that makes me want to hurry home for the night.
A letter?
Yeah. Before we could do direct transmissions,
I never even knew this place existed...
It's a gift for you.
My, my, my.
Mr. Postman! What did you find?
So, that means...
Who knows? There were countless bases.
Hey there! I've got a delivery for the Aria Company!
Be careful not to fall off the bike!
You really treat her like a little kid, don't you?
The sky is a sea of its own.
Right!
I can't believe this ocean wasn't always here.
There don't seem to be any detailed records left.
President Aria?
What that girl wanted to send him... were these feelings.
They were carried to him. They were finally carried to him.
You once said that Neo-Venezia was made of miracles.
Wonderous things.
Why? When do we stop believing in them?
I can't believe I received this! It's an invitation to Neverland!
All right, then! Wait for me!
Somebody's there!
Do you suppose they were sent by the real Peter Pan?!
Aika, you too? But why?
Wow! A pure-white sand beach!
Is Athena your instructor, Alice?
Quite.
That is... really a mystery...
You're not making any headway at all!
I'm falling again.
My, my...
Yeah.
Can't move...
How do I put it?
but you guys also need to take a breather.
All the colors, the way it feels like you're flying!
Has anyone seen Alice?
Ready... Go!
The waves sound so peaceful, don't they?
We looked all over, but couldn't find it.
It's perfect!
Really? Now I can't wait to eat them!
Nobody said anything like that.
When does that happen?
And yet it's definitely here.
What is it?
Not with sadness, but with the feeling that everything was just so wonderful."
I want to hear that wonderful singing voice of hers!
Since Aika's on a company vacation, today it's just Alice and I training."
It's like an angel singing.
then I'll never be able to write with it, either.
Maybe.
Your left-hand campaign?
Shall we take her back to my company?
Maa, don't cry.
Doesn't Athena look like the girl with the beautiful singing voice we saw before?
Oh, so she's that Athena?!
Oh? What's wrong?
She forgets all the important details.
...she's probably just like my left hand.
Hm?
Yeah, I know.
Y- Yeah...
Maa!
Athena knew all about Maa.
Athena did that?
I'm worse than a left hand.
I couldn't even protect Maa.
Isn't that great news, Alice?
"Akari, about that baked potato.
But still, thanks to that,
Huh?
Ack!
Good. Well done.
Sorry.
Sorry for the disruption.
President?
Fenice...
The opera's expensive, isn't it?
Gondola, coming through!
Oh?
Why don't I give you a full taste of our training?
That's fine with you, isn't it?
First is Akari!
Hm?
Gondola, coming through!
But you spoke so softly that the gondola at the crossing couldn't hear you.
What'd you come out here for, Alicia?
All right!
Really? How wonderful!
All right! And we have to get back to training!
Then which way?!
I really had no idea this would happen.
I wonder if we'll just have to wait for the water level to go down.
Going that way.
It's pitch black.
Stop, Akari!
Thank goodness!
Yeah.
President Aria?
"Ai, between the busy summer and autumn sightseeing seasons, there's a bit of a lull.
My, my, my...
"Please don't look for me."
Ribbit!
Ribbit!
Hey!
But even so, there are all sorts of preparations we have to make for winter.
Are you out for a walk, Aika?
Yeah! There's a great place near here.
What are you doing dressed in that weird getup, President Aria?
Oh, President Aria!
You're not bad! Okay, just keep your balance, like that.
Ken came back!
And look how dirty he is now.
God must have brought him back to me!
Thank goodness!
If that's your dream, does that mean it's okay if people don't admire you now?
Even if no one looks up to you now, I'm sure one day, uh... Hmm.
"Ai, we've changed uniforms for the season,
No.
Here, I have some hot milk with honey for you.
My, my.
And is it okay for you to be here?
Jougasaki Village. Jougasaki Village.
Isn't it pretty?
No matter how rigorous your training may be,
please work us as hard as you can!
This one!
I'll bet this is all a recognition judgment exercise...
Ow!
Uh-huh!
Really tasty!
I thought we came here for training...
It's okay, right? It's fun.
Eat all you like!
Wow!
Wow! Tatami mats!
Neo-Venezia is a city, so the street lights keep it bright as day during the night.
Look, Grandma, I beg of you!
Yes?
Exactly.
Praise yourself honestly when you try your best.
Then there's nothing more I can really teach you.
Um, I want to be the number one...
Me too.
...because it sparkles so brightly."
You aren't good in cold weather either, are you, Akari?
It must be a pain trying to scull a gondola at that time of the year.
Gotta get up...
Aika, you're so warm.
Alicia, I'm back!
My, my! Welcome back.
Cleaning?
I figured I'd get the heating ready to use.
Indeed.
Yes, they seem to appear out of nowhere when winter comes.
And then, when it gets really cold,
Hey there, Sideburns. And... Miss Alicia!
See you later!
Bye!
We'll go on our next break.
I'll go with you.
All right! Then we'll all go to the hot spring!
What should you bring to a hot spring?
Yeah!
Oh...
But you know, this scene almost feels warm in a way, doesn't it?
Please relax and enjoy your stay.
We appreciate it!
What a great room!
Welcome.
I'm heading in.
Akari, Aika, I'm heading in.
Wait! Wait!
No clumsy slowpokes allowed.
Yeah...
Huh?
All right! And after a nice bath, next comes a fun dinnertime!
Ah, it doesn't get any better than this.
Good morning.
To tell the truth, even on a vacation like today,
Oh... You should have said something!
Yeah!
Akira!
Looks like we missed dinner, huh?
I invited them.
All night?
From heaven... to hell.
They're returning to the ash trees, so that winter can begin.
"Ai, it's true that Aqua's winter is cold,
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
In the daytime, the sun is covered by a layer of lead-colored clouds.
Alicia, we're back!
Athena, you act like this is your house.
Oh? Is there something wrong with that?
Do you three always practice together?
Oh?
Oh?
My, my.
Hey!
She's face down...
Hi! Please excuse my friend Alicia.
I'm Athena.
Here you go, President Aria.
By the way, I know this might be an awkward question,
You really are a pain.
My, my, my.
Alicia, you go first.
I'm a little embarrassed.
That was amazing, Athena!
We had so much fun back then. The three of us were together every day.
Time has a way of changing everything. Sometimes gently, and sometimes harshly.
We should say, "the old days were fun, as well."
you'll never run out of things that you enjoy.
Why not? They haven't had the chance for a while.
But they hardly ever get together now.
You're worried about all that talk before, right?
Aika...
They probably talked like this when they were Singles, too.
Let's spend a wonderful moment together.
It's snowing again.
Want to take the day off?
Yeah. To the oldest bridge in Neo-Venezia.
I have.
Really?
but no one goes there anymore.
Why not go?
This is it, isn't it?
It really is an old bridge, isn't it?
And when did all of the clouds clear away?
Right, right.
Yes!
Thank you very much.
No sappy lines allowed.
Do people say stuff like that to you?
Oh, no reason!
Say, it looks like it's warmed up outside.
The sunlight warms up your whole body.
Oh, the truth is I only came to Aqua a year and a half ago.
It looks okay...
I'm so sorry!
Uh, try the bread, too. I baked it this morning.
Uh, no problem.
On a gondola?
Huh?
but I've dropped it twice already!
It must be!
Everyone, cut that out!
It'll probably fail this time, too.
But this year, it'll work for sure!
You think so? Well, I won't waste time getting my hopes up.
What?
People determined to create a world overflowing with happiness.
Huh?
Okay.
That's why I'm headed out to Piazza San Marco... to celebrate New Year's with everyone."
Especially after I said we'd come early to save a place for Miss Alicia!
We were saving this spot for you, Miss Alicia!
After that, we celebrate like crazy all night, until the first sunrise of the new year.
Whoa! It was almost like I could actually hear Ai's voice just now.
Akari, I'm here!
My brother Atsushi has business, so he'll be coming tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, you must be Mr. Akatsuki the Salamander!
What a cute little kid!
O-Old man?
My, my!
My, my.
You think so?
Oh, my goodness! President Aria, I see you're looking well.
Hey, Sideburns. Who's the old lady?
Yeah...
Huh? Wait a minute...
That ribbon...
Yeah, Ai!
Quattro!
Oh, she's so cute!
Aqua...
...the New Year's sunrise with her, here on my beloved Aqua.
The first sunrise...
The sunlight is so warm.
Huh?!
My, my!
Bye!
Yeah.
...I say, with my heart full of thanks:
I'm sure a sparkling encounter is waiting for us today, too!
No sappy lines allowed!
Yes, please do, Ai.
I'll help out in the shop until afternoon.
Yes!
I'm not sure.
Because today is a special day.
...look forward to having their own wonderful encounters, too.
It really suits you.
It's tough being an underling, huh?
Ah, really?
3cHA8A9D7Wha-?
But no one's been able to find out his identity.
Ai, did you see that?
Wait, what? What did you see?
Ah!
Wha-!
I wonder where they went?
They understand you, Akari.
We want to go where you're going!
Um, what were we doing here?
Jeez, it's already really late.
Aye-aye!
Is it... a letter?
Sure.
Are... you serious?
Alice, what's the circle below that symbol?
What a nice place.
At this rate we'll be searching for the treasure all night!
Isn't this the caf where caf au lait was invented?
Thank you for waiting.
I didn't order this.
It's courtesy of that gentleman over there.
This is from the young lady over there.
What's happening?
Following... the shadow?
The fourth time?
Ah, you there. I'll have another one.
Wow... That's amazing.
"It's the finest drawing room in the world."
The finest drawing room in the world...
Please excuse me.
This is the one.
We didn't notice while it was in the shade.
There it is!
What!
Hey, hey. What does it say this time?
There wasn't actually a murder there.
Akari...
"Go down Comedy Calle, and you'll find another world in the sky."
What's it doing here?
President Aria?
Wait, Akari!
Make sure you don't fall behind!
The people who found it before us must have returned it, too.
I'm sure someone else will find them someday, as long as this city exists.
It kind of tickles inside.
What a lucky coincidence to see you here!
The person who hid the treasure is probably an expert on Neo-Venezia.
Thank you!
"Ai, I had so much fun today, meeting all the wonderful experts.
I wonder if I can be an expert on something too, someday?"
My shoulders ache because I tense up in the cold.
It's warmer than yesterday, though.
Tell us about it!
Ah, sure...
This is so uncool...
I'm really stuffed.
Uh...
A meteor shower, huh? Sounds fun!
Gnomes like to stay out of daylight, so it's the perfect event for you!
Veto!
No and no!
Alice got in touch with me and said she's going to pass tonight because she's sleepy.
Good evening!
S-S-S-Say something if you're there!
We shall not give up! We'll continue our search!
For the best spot!
Akari, what's gotten into you?
This is what I call a great view.
Huh?
In that sense, the shooting stars we're seeing now are a gift...
Eh? But if we didn't do our job, Aqua's gravity would...
Where have you been?
Um, that was supposed to be an old, classic pun from Manhome...
No sappy lines allowed!
That way you talk like an old man!
Because I love Aqua, too!"
Aika, have you ever received a letter in the mail? I don't mean e-mail.
Not exactly...
I'm sorry.
There we go.
Do you think that's possible?
Sorry to bother you. I know it was a strange favor.
Ah, I see!
Huh? You want to come too, Mr. President?
This must be it, President Aria.
Come to think of it, I don't know his real name.
What a lovely building!
Some of the young staffers call me "Gramps" or "Grandpa," too.
Eh? Are you sure?
Okay, put it back!
Not bad at all for your first time!
Let's take our time and make the rounds.
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.
This lunch box is for you.
Today's processing is already closed,
so the earliest it could be delivered is tomorrow.
I'm Akari Mizunashi, an Undine from the Aria Company.
I'm going to back-paddle.
Yes.
Yes, good work!
Watch my step...
Hope you have a happy life, Ayano!
When I thought about how this was goodbye, I got really sad.
Delivery complete!
Thanks for everything.
I just realized this after making a full day of deliveries with you, but...
You're right. I wonder why that is?
Good morning.
Thanks for yesterday.
...and venture off to somewhere you've never been?
If you keep saying "ri-ight" like that, you're going to get lost or caught up in a crime.
"Ai, spring is about to arrive in Neo-Venezia, carried in on the wind.
There are so many large torii!
He's the guardian deity of this shrine.
Ah, yes.
The Fox has been known to take humans back with him.
You're right...
I thought someone was following us...
Let's find some shelter first.
Alicia!
Granny! Ten inari please!
My, look...
Mr. Fox, I'm sorry I got scared.
It's another beautiful day, isn't it?
Good morning.
Well, it's such a beautiful day, I thought we'd go look for spring.
Yes, spring.
I feel like we're an exploration party. I'm so excited!
You can't see the sky through all the branches and leaves.
Come on, let's go.
I wonder if there was a railroad track on the path we were just on?
Zun zun zun-taka, zun-taka zun!
My, my.
Is this...
It looks like it's been abandoned here for decades.
Have you heard this story before?
"Make one mistake and you'll never find what you're looking for," he said.
But when he finally lifted his head, he saw a world so magnificent,
Alicia...
My, my.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Sure.
Wow...
Say what?
Wha-What!
It's really, really none of your business.
Aika, we should head out soon.
Ah, so that's what it's about...
Okay.
Ah, here comes Athena!
Wow, what a lovely garden!
It looks lovely on you.
You look like a princess!
I really don't understand.
Athena, the mailboxes aren't that way.
"Oops?"
Is there something you're happy about?
Alice, Alice! You have a letter.
Huh?
She was scouted by Orange Planet at such a young age.
At all.
I can see you in the mirror, Alice.
Fight!
Maybe I'll try a little harder, too.
I'm dizzy.
Huh?
I wonder.
Well, this could be fun!
I hate to say it, but in a few years, they'll be the top water guides in the city.
Until you came, Akari.
Yes, if you'll excuse me.
Oh no! It's our pleasure!
Yeah.
She's said to be a genius at handling an oar.
Have you forgotten? He was my first customer.
You're over-steering!
Do you have the day off from your job as a Salamander?
Um, Akatsuki-san?
Ah, Alice-chan!
What's wrong?
Isn't it rude of you to keep calling her sideburns like that?
She's got those long sideburns, after all.
But they're not sideburns...
But it's vital that I see him!
He's walking incredibly slowly, isn't he?
Just make sure you pay me back when you get paid.
Were you keeping him company?
There are large and small islands all over the Neo-Adriatic Sea.
Akari-san.
It might be an unhappy letter, you know.
No way!
Let's spend a wonderful moment together!
I'd check to see if it's still there the next day.
Wha-!
Oh...
Say what?
That the cats have their own kingdom.
If we're going to practice, don't you think it's better to have a destination?
What?
Well, I never had a reason to.
You and your strange, distracting comments! I lost President Aria again!
Calm down. We'd probably just go in circles even if we go back!
Unfortunately, they say humans can't enter the cat kingdom.
What should we do, Aika?
I'll scull!
Okay, please do.
Were we inviting ourselves to a place where the cats... don't want us to come?
President Aria came home as usual, and ate a tummy full of food.
But..."
Well, you know.
Wha-?! Are you saying you're not serious when you practice with us?
No...
What is it?
Maybe he wants to be friends?"
That's so exciting!
I wonder if I'll get one too?
Do you understand, Sideburns?
Yes...
You should be honored!
It's a courtesy rose, though.
Okay.
All right, I'll join you.
Aika!
Someone gave you a rose, too.
Did Al give it to you?
That's right!
Okay, got it.
Huh? Most of them are addressed to Akira.
You're still buying more?
That's the best I can do!
Look at how many I'm buying from you!
To prove to her father that his love was true, the young man joined the war.
Yes?
No sappy lines allowed.
I see.
Huh?
It's a raw gemstone called "The Eye of the Rose."
Akari.
Hey Al. Long time no see.
Whoa, what's all this, Akatsuki?
Yeah!
Okay.
Th-Th-This i-i-is m-m-my tru-tru-true f-f-f-fe-fe-fe-fe-fe-fweelingpkh!
Yeah!
Eh? Wait! What! No! Aah!
Yes, I'm just coming from the meeting.
President Aria!
...is sure to bring a warm light to anyone's heart.
Thank you.
No old man jokes allowed...
Yeah, it'll be okay.
I see...
As you can see, chrysanthemum decorations are all over the city.
I see... so Neo-Venezia reflects that, too!
All right.
Yes, it really is...
This garden is always well tended...
...is a good way to measure how homely the lady of the house is in Neo-Venezia.
I'm in awe!
Looking over your shoulders isn't allowed!
She even knows about the gardens in private homes.
This wall is cute!
Yes, Junior?
Ma'am, I'll take three!
Yes!
My, my. That sounds like fun.
It's a match made in heaven.
She said, "I thought it'd be nice to have some different light for once."
The wonder was just hiding, wasn't it?
Yes...
My, my. We blew them all out.
You're right...
...depending on how you feel at that particular time and place.
"Infinite wonders, huh...
That means there's an endless amount of wonderful things.
When we meet different people, we all become connected, right?
So my acquaintance's acquaintance is also my acquaintance?
Summer is the most popular tourist season,
so a lot of people come to Neo-Venezia, and the entire city gets quite busy.
It's a beautiful day today, so I thought I'd do all the laundry together!
How's your back?
I'm glad to hear that!
I'm glad you found it!
How do you know her, Akari?
What's her name?
Huh?
Hey, Junior.
Yes?
Aika.
You didn't have to tell them the destination?
It's gotten quite warm, hasn't it?
Should we go?
Do you think we'll find out the secret behind Akari's mysterious personality?
Like I said, we've arrived at a stop.
Hmm, how do I describe it...
She's really in trouble!
She can't hear you.
We'll meet back here in ten minutes.
Do you think we're going the right way?
What he's doing?
She made another new acquaintance.
Yeah.
Huh?
Huh? Was that really a coincidence?"
That's correct.
Ah, no, I'm fine.
You'll have to review all the talking points for a guide tonight.
It's pretty, but...
It's hot in here, isn't it?
Glass is very delicate.
There we go. Thanks for waiting.
Ah, pleased to meet you.
It's the soda-lime.
Did you bake it just for today?
I see you're still an apprentice, too.
Regardless of the artisan's skills,
When Manhome's Venice was submerged,
that's when the highly skilled craft of making Venetian glass was lost.
They began by gathering documents and materials,
and searching for artisans who had inherited the craft from the artisans before them.
Through endless trial and error, we've managed to bring it to what it is today.
Well, let's hurry on to our destination.
To tell you the truth...
...lately, a lot of people have been saying...
and the emotions felt here, are also different, I think.
Have you become an Akari fan, too?
Ah, Alicia! Please wait for me!
Next time I'd like to go to the workshop and see the plates and glasses, too.
By the way, where's President Aria?
Let's show him the mirage.
President Aria?
...I couldn't catch up no matter how much I chased after him.
But there's nothing to worry about. You'll be cool here...
Thank you for the drink.
Maybe the cats secretly invited you because it was so hot?
I took my customers to Piazza San Marco, and they gave it to me as a gift.
Right!
There are a lot of stands this year, too!
I'd like this one, please.
You came to buy one too, Alice?
"Ai, ever since then,
The light...
Let's row out tonight and say goodbye.
When the night-shine gem nears the end of its life,
Tante grazie.
Alicia!
My!
This is the first time I've seen one, too.
It's still pretty hot, isn't it?
...to kick the stone the whole way home...
...while staying on the lines between the stone pavement.
Any spot that doesn't have shadows is magma!
Alice, Alice! Here!
I told you, you're not allowed to help!
Alice, where are you going?
Again? What is it this time?
Are you trying to act like an ally of justice?
Right.
She's always been a true, special ally to me.
Huh?
Here we go!
Why doesn't the Aria Company have a painted palina, you ask?
Yes, I was just wondering.
Me?!
Yeah, yeah.
My, my. Have you been well, President Aria?
Umm...
My, that's a shame.
All right!
Thank you very much.
Would you like us to help you?
Then, give it all you've got and do your best, okay?
Yes!
I wonder how I'll have changed by then?
You think so?
Yes.
It represents me, as I am now...
Yes, yes. Back to practice.
When you see your childhood friends, who you haven't seen in awhile...
The opposite is possible too...
He's so cute!
Are you alone?
Yeah.
I just finished practice.
I'm on an errand for my idiot brother.
How's Aika doing today?
Yes.
How will you ever protect Aqua's peace with that attitude?
I'm me! That's who!
Loser.
...peace?
Right now, this very spot...
Now's your chance to back out.
Well, see you down there!
Are you all right?
About our battle...
No way! Are you sure, Akatsukin?
This is for Aqua's peace...
I think you're misunderstanding something.
Huh? Akatsuki, when did you start listening to our conversation?
Hmh, quite a while ago.
Hm? I've been here for a while now.
I was on my way back since my tours were done.
...and say farewell.
Sideburns is getting depressed.
You didn't realize it?
If you have an encounter, there'll always come a day when you have to say goodbye, right?
and each gondola lasts for about twenty years.
This gondola is very old, but...
I'm sad I have to part with it, but...
Thank you very much.
Let's take lots of photos tomorrow.
Akari, calm down.
Hey, Sideburns!
I'll retrace the route we took on our first ride, Akatsuki.
Six o'clock?
In fifteen minutes?
Are we going to make it?
Plus...
...I'm your customer, Sideburns.
I understand.
Well...
W-W-W-What are you saying?!
Sir, if you please!
Sure!
Wow, it's amazing!
Really, Alicia?
Where to?
Yes?
This gondola knows you from when you were a Pair, doesn't it?
That wax you use is Grandma's special wax, with a little recipe adjustment by me.
Good evening.
Well, shall we make a toast?
Right!
Yes!
Cheers! Cheers!
I'm sad to say goodbye to the gondola that's been so good to me, but...
What's going to happen to this gondola?
This gondola has been working since the Aria Company first opened.
Thank you very much.
I hope you find a good owner.
Be sure you don't catch a cold, okay?
Thank you very much, President Aria.
...I'd like to stay like this a little longer.
...and take away the gondola.
Alicia, that's the gondola you'll be using.
Thank you very much!
Aika, what are you most proud of? Your dependable personality?
I'm on the evening shift so I don't have to worry, but...
It's a good thing we made it. Right, Athena?
Now!
Sorry to keep you waiting!
My black hair shimmers even more in the summer sun, doesn't it?
My, my.
It just wouldn't be a barbecue without meat.
Sorry about that.
If you have time to make wishes, work on refining your sculling skills.
It's really yummy.
No, it's not that...
Umm... I'm going to head back.
Sorry! Please excuse us, too!
You two can stay put.
Shut up!
Akira...
Eat as much as you want!
What about the grilled rice balls?
What about this?
Remember how I mentioned...
No, it is impossible.
What... did you say?
What did you say just now?
Aika!
Is Aika all right?
Eh? Are you sure?
That hairstyle really suits you, Aika.
Okay! Let's get started, then!
My, my. You need to eat your vegetables too, Akira.
I want to go to Neo-Venezia again!"
I'm just speaking hypothetically.
No, that's not it.
Uh, no...
Even I'm starting to think I look a bit more mature.
Wha-?!
I'm bored!
I'm not sleepy at all because I've already slept so much!
We came to see how you're doing!
I can't see you two right now!
You see...
They're not slacking off from practice without me.
I have to hurry back there!
We brought you pudding.
Those were my silly thoughts, at the end of summer.
On top of that, as soon as the airhead Akari relaxes...
...she's so scatterbrained, she goes straight into "wonderful mode."
...today, I'm the one... who's feeling scatterbrained.
That's not allowed, not allowed!
Aika, those are cute hairpins.
Thank you very much.
It's not that...
I've been going crazy since this morning, all because of these hairpins.
You really should go.
It's so strange to think that this is what controls Aqua's gravity.
Their okame udon is fantastic, apparently.
What am I?
...you ate okame udon but it's not like I knew you'd come down the stairs to walk it off and...
Old Man Apa told me.
Yep. What do you think?
If you keep thinking scary thoughts, even the littlest things can start to look scary.
No scary stories allowed!
The wind...
Ah, maybe you don't want scary stories?"
Akari, sorry to keep you waiting.
Might as well, since it's summer... Want to hear this city's famous ghost story?
No, no, no, no!
Yeah.
...because her mother and father were laid to rest there.
...something terrifying began to happen.
Huh?!
Send my regards to President Aria!
...I'm glad I found President Aria's favorite canned peaches.
But what am I to do?
Umm...
Akari is late, isn't she?
Is her dress a mourning dress?
Thank you very much.
What's happening?
It'll be okay.
We'll get along just fine.
Huh?
Well, Cait Sith...
Scary... Scary... Scary... Scary!
Can you show us the flower petal that only blooms on San Michele Island, again?
Sure, here.
But it wasn't just Akari... A lot of people have seen her in Neo-Venezia.
3cH6D4B3BEeeek!
...I shouldn't be able to hear them from here.
Not only that, but they don't run that late at night."
Akari, make sure you're careful!
You always seem to attract weird things.
Is this...
Okay Akari, dock by that tree again and...
Akari Mizunashi?
Huh?
How should I put it...
W-W-Wha-! Akari!
When did you?
He's warm...
Ah, that's right! He also has a pretty tail!
Cait Sith again?
I'm just cautious.
It's quiet, isn't it...
I wonder if he doesn't have a ticket?
I think it'd be better if the kitten used this ticket...
Also, thank you very much for inviting me today.
But now, maybe you both finally took a step toward each other?
...together with you, Akari!"
I wouldn't have met Alicia, or anyone else for that matter.
Those worlds are called "parallel worlds."
Okay, President Aria. Let's go to gondola practice.
Okay, let's go.
What are you doing here?
That's...
They're not sideburns...
Oh no! Oh no!
B-B-Both of you, please stop!
What's the matter, President Aria?
President Aria has been acting a little strange today.
Ah, that's no good.
President Aria!
I was about to leave for practice today, when President Aria ran off somewhere.
Ah, thank you, thank you!
Brother!
But even I have a secret I cannot tell anyone.
She's probably still out shopping.
Here's your snack for today.
A popsicle.
What's for dinner tonight?
Aahhhh!
Mother...
Stay away!
Oh, I see!
When he was especially paranoid, he'd ask me over ten times a day!
T-The other day...
Today's customers are a married couple celebrating their anniversary in Neo-Venezia.
Hello, is anyone here?
Oh, your necktie is crooked.
Stop it. We're in public.
Huh?
Ah, it's nothing. Here I go!
I'm very sorry.
Yeesh...
No sappy lines allowed!
Take care.
Umm, please use my gondola if you'd like!
Because I really love Neo-Venezia!
Why would she do all this for a stranger?
Hey, this one's really pretty. Look, look!
Huh?
What is it?
Darling... What is this?
If it's okay, please let us join in, too.
Amazing!
Hey!
Wow, we even have music!
This is just as good as the real thing!
Huh? It's gone.
I bought one, but...
...eternally in love with the sea.
...he has always given me his unwavering love.
No... sappy...
Something wrong?
Y... Yeah.
My grandma's been kind of sick lately...
It's not a matter of "if"!
You just need to choose a dependable apprentice.
That's not the point!
It's raining...
She was saying things like, "I'll show you how much I've excelled!"
I'm sure the customers were looking forward to riding your gondola, too.
3cH7B8A6BHmm?
I'm sure everyone senses that I'll become a Prima very soon.
Let's put your really big delusions aside and start studying already.
Oh?
Sorry, but I need your help organizing these files.
So when they inherited an alias, it also meant they were inheriting the privilege to do business.
She's letting us know that to become Primas, we need to be able to do this kind of stuff too?
Aika?
That girl...
But you have a wonderful mentor too, Alice.
Stuff like, "She thinks she's so great because she's one of the Three Great Water Fairies."
Akira...
I just accept them for what they are.
...a Prima Undine.
It stopped raining.
Akira is wonderful, isn't she?
That's why we need to become much...
Akari?
Ah, sorry. What is it?
She said she'd visit for the Redentore Festival, right?
Yeah. She said she wanted to see my new gondola.
This year, I was thinking maybe we could all take it easy, if Ai is visiting.
I slept.
But Redentore festivities go all night long.
Let me guess... Are we having another special training session?
Umm, are the six of us spending it together this year?
Preparing the food and drinks is a given...
Figuring out how to flavor traditional dishes, and choosing matching drinks...
Good luck, you three.
Yes. What do you think?
Yes.
All right! Let's do one heck of a job, then!
Oh, nothing.
Grandma.
Okay.
Thanks!
And finally, the day of Redentore arrived!
The exciting day is upon us!
My, my. Good evening.
Good evening.
They look delicious!
I didn't contact you because I wanted to surprise you. I'm sorry.
I'm Atsushi, her husband.
Long time no see.
It's marvelous. The three of you did a fantastic job.
I lost track of the time.
Sure hits the spot.
I'm so happy I met you, Akari.
And then... And then...
...Aqua is still too far away for me to go there by myself.
"Ai, I used to feel the same way as you."
What?
Did something happen?
Wha-?!
Jeez! Don't go thinking just anyone can be like Alicia!
Huh?
What is it?
You're right!
Alicia?
That's big!
Umm...
Thank you very much! That was a lot of fun.
Huh?
Yes, we're sorry.
I put some panini on the grill!
Huh? It's the Undines from earlier.
I'm home.
That snowball's gotten incredibly big, hasn't it?
Yay!
...I always used to make a snowball when it snowed.
Her smile was the very embodiment of a Water Fairy.
I'll be swimming through the sky again today, too!
So, what kind of grownup do you want to be, Akari?
Huh?
I'm sure you'll soon be a fairy too, Akari.
Yes.
You're both really sleepy-heads...
Well, it is spring, after all.
It's Al.
Indeed.
But what's with all these difficult words, one after another?
Now, now, don't say that.
Here's a glass of water, Akari.
Delivery for the Aria Company!
Coming!
Spring is almost here in Neo-Venezia.
Do you remember? It's the lady who came with her daughter.
It's slow this time of year, so Akira and Athena might be able to join us, too.
If I think of it that way, it doesn't feel lonely at all.
Please pull yourself together!
Oh, something smells delicious.
All right! First, we need to wash our hands and gargle.
The building on your right is Palazzo Ducale.
Once we leave this canal, the wind will become colder, so please be careful.
Not at all, I'm happy we came. We hardly ever see snow back home.
Your daughter and Neo-Venezia have a wonderful gift for you.
Please hold out your hand.
You're too amazing, Alicia.
Huh? Did something happen?
Hey, cut it out!
It's fine, it's fine! I have good sense of balance!
Honestly...
What's with him all of a sudden?
Or when I slammed into the glass door in the bathroom?
If you believe you've reached the top and become complacent, you can't move forward.
Yes.
Their own brilliance...
Do you remember?
Grandma taught us that, didn't she?
Um...
I was thinking, maybe that's something really special?
We're definitely going to become the brightest stars!
They'll become fairies, bringing new wonders to Neo-Venezia.
"Akari, it seems like spring in Neo-Venezia helps bring out everyone's true colors.
Welcome back, Alicia!
Oh, my!
Congratulations, Akari.
If this customer's like that, Akari will be teased like crazy, and it'll end in disaster.
Huh?
They ride in a Single's gondola and conduct surprise inspections on their aptitude.
Apparently, if you fail, you get demoted from a Single to a Pair.
I'm Amarantha. I believe I have an appointment for today?
Pleased to meet you!
Why don't you sit next me?
W-Well, aren't you worried about Akari being out there on her own, though?
I-I see...
It really is.
Akari?
Could you move the gondola forward a little, please?
Could you go in between those two palina, please?
Of course.
Where are you going to take me next?
Well then, allow me take you to our next destination.
Who would have thought there'd be a sightseeing spot here?
Oh, is that so?
Thank you very much.
Continued?
I want to eat buttered potatoes, too!
Please restrain yourself, Aika.
Akari?
Amazing!
I can see you've definitely inherited the Aria Company's spirit of hospitality.
Yes!
Oh?
I'm not the only one who likes to take tours on a Single's gondola.
...was created so that everyone could help nurture them.
Um, did Athena cause you any trouble?
Not at all.
Let's see...
There's another church too, the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore.
P-President Aria?
Wow... Those are such big paintings...
I'd like one, please.
Thank you!
Are you all right?
I'll clean it up right away, so please just leave it there.
Here you go.
Be careful this time, okay?
Here you go.
Oh?
It's delicious! I think it has a slightly different taste.
Ah, you're right. The scaffolding has already been set up.
I just saw that patisserie from the other day.
I haven't seen him in Piazza San Marco since that day.
He was staring at Ca' d'Oro just now, as well.
I wonder if he's not going to sell chocolates anymore?
Thank you for all the wonderful memories today.
Ah, okay.
Excuse me, Mr. Patisserie?
Huh?
Maybe he isn't here yet?
Neo-Venezia gives you hints, doesn't it?
Eh? But...
Okay...
You're right.
Hello.
He's the owner of this caf.
All the paintings are the originals from back then.
They belong here?
Thank you. I'll do my best.
"Dear Ai, something new and wonderful that belongs in Neo-Venezia has just been born.
Next time, "Those Who Aim For Tomorrow..."
Akari?
Um, the meeting point should be...
Huh? Where'd everyone go?
I look forward to working with you today.
Huh? Sure...
I see...
I bought too many, though! Maybe I'll make some trippa for lunch.
In we go.
Hey, Ayumi.
Anzu's a bit down right now.
Even though she's disappointed every time, she continues to challenge herself and retake it.
Anzu and I have the same mentor, and she's a very strict woman, so...
Becoming a Prima sure must be tough.
It doesn't, though.
but it's also a place where you can work and earn a living.
That's why I love this job.
I'll redo my training again and again.
Someday if I do get to take the exam and I happen to fail it...
Um, Alicia seems like a really nice person, doesn't she?
Right!
Akari Mizunashi, setting out!
Be careful on your way to the office, okay?
Besides, we're the ones who should be happy.
N-No, I'm not...
Congratulations, Akari.
She disapproves of everything we do.
But lately I've been thinking...
Face it. You really want to become a Prima and tour people around, right?
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Are we sure we have everything?
Alicia, I just got back!
Now, please take my hand.
What do you mean by "nothing"?
Oh yeah, Akari.
Back to work, back to work...
That's right. She's the most levelheaded and hardworking of the three, don't you think?
Oh, you already switched to your summer uniform?
She really looks happier than usual, too.
I am, because everyone could feel the coming of summer by seeing my uniform.
Those two were bestowed with natural talent. They're actually geniuses, don't you think?
How can you...
They're both great people...
It was when Athena got promoted to Prima after Alicia.
Thank you.
Just kidding!
Thank you.
There are blessed, special people who can become Primas...
Why don't you give up?
See? A cute four-leaf clover, done!
Now you'll be okay, right, Miss?
At that moment, a girl much younger than I taught me something very precious.
If a genius is someone who's been bestowed with a gift from the heavens...
What a great story!
No, I thought it! I was thinking it! I'm so embarrassed!
But it's definitely another face of Neo-Venezia.
The scenery here never seems to change.
Ready, President Aria?
But that Sylph guy said it's good for me to have so much energy!
Why don't we go eat that?
Exciting, exciting.
It's here!
President Aria!
Oh well, maybe I'll go yank on her sideburns as a greeting anyway.
Where is she?
Where is she, where is she, where is she?
Where is she, where is she, where is she, where is she, where is she, where is she?!
Yeah.
Thanks!
Huh? My pizza...
It looks great on you.
This entrance is off limits to the public. Please use the elevator like everyone else.
I will!
It's my very own place.
Eh, whatever.
Oh, wow!
Come to think of it, why did I have to follow Sideburns in the first place?
Surrounded by this scenery that never changes, happy things, new things, even sad things...
Sorry to interrupt.
You better not tell Alicia anything! Understand?!
Does that mean I will have changed a little bit, too?"
I'm back!
My, my. Welcome back!
She's way too nice...
No, what she should have said was, "Hey, hey. Grumble."
Yeah! They're also very sweet.
"I know she scolds me because she cares about me, but...
You're going to get scolded by Alicia if you keep this up, you know.
Sorry...
She truly is a water fairy descended from the heavens! Miss Perfect!
Yes...
Since the members of the Aria Company always treat me so well,
She said she had something to do today, and went home.
I'm really sorry!
My, my...
Thank you so much, President Aria!
But...
What a coincidence, Alice.
Thank you!
Umm...
What would you do if he kept on making mistakes, though?
Well...
I'll share her challenges, share her defeats...
My, my.
Because...
The two of you are so alike, I get embarrassed just watching you both.
"I wish my mother was like Alicia.
Hmm... But then my mother wouldn't be herself, would she?"
President Aria, come to think of it, how long have you been with the Aria Company?
So lace was developed from the art of weaving nets.
The woman we're going to visit now, Anna, was also very beautiful in her lace wedding dress.
Let's see... She was a cheerful and glamorous Undine.
Ah, yes. Pleased to meet you! I'm Akari Mizunashi.
Hey!
Everything else is either my own work, or was given to me by someone else.
That embroidery became the real bridge that connected you and the islanders, didn't it?
Whoa, great way to put it, Akari!
We just happened to bump into each other.
I picked out the ones that looked especially tasty!
Looks delicious.
This looks amazing!
It's delicious!
Thank you.
There's a lot of Aria Company history that I don't know, isn't there?
If you hadn't, Alberto and I would have never met,
You always seem to be here, lately.
Alice?
Athena, you need to close the door properly, or...
She's asleep.
My, my!
Here.
Eh? Umm...
Maybe now she'll remember...
Yes?
Eh?
What is it, Alicia?
Hey, why don't we take her to places she knows?
On top of that, Athena is a regular, so they have a special menu just for her.
It's all right. I like the way President Aria feels.
Athena, I...
Alicia, by any chance...
To everyone I've met along the way...
Why don't you just walk home normally?
...looks like you failed your "walking backwards" challenge.
All right! We'll set our sights on becoming Primas today as usual! Let's-a-go!
Here!
Eh?
Unlike Piazza San Marco, this area is a mix of shops, markets, bars and private residences.
Until the water elevator reaches the top, you can come out of work mode and take a breather.
You can do everything now, can't you?
Thanks to all that training with my friends,
...our destination is just ahead!
What's going on?
Akari, Aika!
Akari, Aika...
Thank you... so much...
Eh?
Alice will notice we're here!
I really already noticed you. What are you doing here?
Spying on me is really not allowed!
This is how you looked.
That's a zombie.
You know there's no time to be depressed, right?
It's not a tradition we have here on Aqua.
Don't be so sure!
President Maa, President Aria's pudgy-wudgy tummy isn't a moon-gazing dumpling!
He might be lost somewhere, too.
Akari...
Al!
Honestly. No overworking allowed!
I-I think so...
...I heard they used to collect rainwater in the wells in each plaza, and used that for drinking water.
And why did you jump down?
It's okay! President Maa is a fine Aqua Cat that can understand human language!
At any rate, you're the only one who can help us!
It's because of the forces of attraction and repulsion.
or a lion, or a woman's profile, or rabbits pounding rice cakes...
Not allowed!
Al...
Gnomes are always working in the dark and can see really well at night, so...
...but the thing closest to Aqua is that very moon.
A-Aika!
What's that?
Crybaby Serenade...
In her case, it's not just about becoming a Prima.
She's the first one to ever do that!
There we go.
It's fine. Be thankful and just eat it.
Yes! I'm super-cheerful!
I was really lucky!
It's not all right!
I see.
What is this?
Akira...
Since I became a Prima, every day has been frantic.
Oh.
Oh, that'd be helpful.
Could you do that for us, please?
Until recently, we used to spend every day together, too.
It's that late already?
I don't have an excuse.
That was fun!
It's for you!
I heard it's really delicious, so I thought we should all try it together.
Ah! I'm so hungry!
You just ate all those bananas. You're really a glutton.
The usual times...
Just a few moments ago, I was fretting about what I would do if I never saw them again, too.
Yeah, you were.
I don't have anything...
You're the excuse, Alice.
All right! Let's focus on becoming Primas, and do our best!
I'm sorry.
Thanks. I knew you'd say that.
So that's the one she chose.
"Not only does Aika have to become a Prima,
Actually, I have another piece of good news.
So, she said she'll be really busy from now on.
She should have been really happy about it, but Aika was in tears.
Calm down, Akatsukin! Calm down!
Ah, yes!
You dropped it again!
Akari...
This gentleman is one of the rowers in the regatta. He makes his own oars.
This is Rialto Bridge, a bridge that spans the entire Canal Grande with its single arch.
As the sun starts to set,
Akari, your sculling and tour guide skills have really improved.
That's very important.
Narrower than any other canal I've ever passed through.
I want to be...
...like you, Alicia...
I want to be a Prima that embodies the Aria Company itself.
...my Aquamarine.
The distant, endless blue.
Now, please take my hand.
That far off future was suddenly upon us...
Ah, yeah, congratulations.
Really congratulations.
Akatsuki...
Are you all right?
Thank you, Aika, Alice.
Yes...
I'm sure...
But Alicia is always smiling.
Huh?
So your alias is Aquamarine?
so I received a few bookings from that, as well.
...Aria Company...
Congratulations on your promotion to Prima, Alicia!
My, my.
Aika?
she's adjusted to her position well, and has become a very dignified supervisor.
...secretly, she's still the same crybaby.
I'm sure it's his way of showing he cares."
Thank you.
...it's easy to tell that she's happy, and proud of Akira's achievements."
Yes, it looks great on you, Ai.
I saw you with Pony-boy on Paglia Bridge the other day.
Oh, come on...
What?
Huh?
Akatsuki was my very first customer, and...
Yay, me too!
Then, I'm going to have... chocolate chip!
Yes.
Oh, so that's who gave it to her. I thought one of her fans or a customer had given it to her.
Aika, why didn't you consider that she could have gotten it from her boyfriend?
I guess you're right. We never hear anything about Akira's love life, do we?
But that doesn't mean she's not seeing anyone, right?
So she would know, right?
Oh, seems like you're in a good mood, Atora.
Well, there's usually a long line at the panini shop, but there was no one there today!
These are salted pollock roe, marinated pollock roe, and salmon roe. I got squid ink, too.
Anzu, please eat as much as you can!
I smell something delicious coming from that bag!
Yeah, but why bring them today?
She said okay!
Hey, Akari! Over here!
That means...
Looks like they did.
It's to train for the upcoming tournament the three of us are entered in!
That's really news to me.
What? Tomorrow?
So pushy...
I can't stop it very well...
I have to receive the ball, like I receive the hearts of the wonderful people of Neo-Venezia, right?
Flattery can make even a pig climb a tree! Wait, never mind...
"Gondola coming through!" Now you!
At the same time, you run towards the goal, and keep in mind, you'll be receiving a pass from Akari.
Right.
Ah!
Even Junior won't be able to catch up to that!
The first power that rose to prominence was the Hime'ya Empire.
A-A'licia... A'licia!
A'licia!
Please dodge things like that, Senior Warrior A'thena!
How dare you! I will avenge Senior Warrior A'thena!
As the battle raged on, one by one, the warriors succumbed to their wounds...
Even the waves are sparkling, as if they're blessing the bright future ahead.
A-A'licia, c-could you p-p-pour m-m-me some tea, too?
Ah... Please let me in, too.
Of course.
It's strange, isn't it? Maybe we got the wrong time?
Sure we can wait, but there's nothing to do in the meantime.
As everyone knows, summer nights aren't complete without...
O-Of course not!
Levelheaded people like Akira tend to be even more scared of things like ghost stories and mice, I think.
Wh... Why are you both looking at me? How should I know if Al is okay with them?!
Well, considering the way he always is, I bet he'd be fine no matter how scary the story is.
Well then, a few years ago, three girls came to this coast on the night of a fireworks show.
Geez! Don't stand behind me without saying anything!
And so...
"Hyu-ru-ru-ru-ru..."
Huh?
...is the same color as my burning blood!
To all evildoers who disrupt the peace...
Kick, kick! Karate chop!
which was full of freshly baked walnut bread.
I'm busy protecting Aqua's peace, Gachapen!
Hello! It's Akatsukin, the Deliverer of Justice!
However, Alicia did not come out of the cat's stomach.
Welcome, Akatsukin.
Ah, well, this is...
Picture Drama Episode 7 is...
That's right! I'm fine because you're with me, President Aria.
Let's bring her some warm, freshly made mugwort rice cakes. What do you think?
Plus, it's been such a long time since I've had a ride on your gondola. I'm looking forward to it!
When she finally did come over, it was because a booking had been suddenly canceled...
I guess she was suddenly worried.
There's no need for you to push yourself either, Akari.
Akari!
Alicia sure is late.
Eh? I'm a Prima?
I'm...
That's why...
Coming!
Freshly laid eggs, just like you ordered!
The wind feels really nice today, so I'm sure it'll be another wonderful day, just like yesterday.
Oh, yes, it will!
Have a nice day!
It's so familiar, and so wonderful.
"Akari, I'm sure an Aria Company with you in charge...
It's just that all three of us have mentors who are too good.
Old Man Apa recommended them, so I've been reading them a lot recently.
No. Well, I guess it's more that he's a man of few words.
Same here.
Right!
I had so much fun. It was fantastic!
Yes!
Um, President...
Akari, let's have some tea after you finish cleaning up.
My, my, how wonderful.
...and the time came for Grandma, who had always been here with me, to leave...
No! I can't bear it!
Even after Akira and Athena became Primas and took on apprentices...
Wha?
I haven't been up here in ages!
This view makes you fall in love with the city all over again, doesn't it?
I'm sure the people of Venice wanted to pass on this view to the next generation.
Just like our mentors who taught us,
We can't do everything perfectly from the start.
Huh?
But we're fully booked this week, so we can't take any time off.
My, my.
I've been waiting for you. Here, come in.
This entrance is usually off limits,
but I'll make an exception since it's for you, Alicia.
Wow!
It's quiet, deep, and gentle...
You can see Piazza San Marco from here!
whom I love and cherish dearly, for just a little while longer?
If you're alone for a long time, I get the feeling that you start to feel separated from your emotions.
Whaat?!
There's no way I'm going to let her beat us now!
No sappy lines allowed.
Welcome!
She's the girl that Orange Planet scouted from the middle school's gondola club.
Um... Alice-san?
I don't autograph things.
But...
Which one should I get?
Have you forgotten? He was my first customer.
You're over-steering!
Are you okay?
You're becoming quite good at this, Sideburns.
Well, I am training...
So that everyone on Aqua can live in an environment just like Manhome's,
Yeah, this world is protected thanks to guys like me.
I'll let you guide me around some more, Sideburns.
You're really nosy!
Okay, but it's something I kinda specialize in.
I feel sorta happy now.
What's the idea, trying to look cool like that, hey?
But I am late... Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Miss Undine?
Don't fight the current.
Using the water as best you can.
open your heart, let it lighten, and if you can become one with the wind,
I'll join you.
This is my first time to Ukijima.
It really is.
It would probably feel niceh to become one with the wind.
...maybe I could even fly way up in the sky.
I was asked to deliver a letter!
I wonder if we Undines could do it too.
Yeah. I'm sure we could.
If it's just feelings, they shouldn't weigh all that much.
Yeah. The weather will be nice tomorrow as well.
I'm sure it will!
That's really cool.
Also, could you go buy some bread at the bakery after you're done there?
Well then, shall we go now, President Aria?
I wonder if this address is wrong.
Still, why would such a little girl be sending such an old letter?
Yeah.
Bye. Please deliver it.
A gift for you.
So it's like you thought?
The address doesn't exist, but there is a place with the same name.
Yeah, I suppose so. That particular place was...
So does that mean someone could still be there?
It reckon it'd take you a month.
Huh?
Aika-chan! Alice-chan!
Will you be okay?
Be careful not to fall from the bike!
We'll take a break on that island up ahead!
What?! You gonna quit being an Undine?!
It looks like the pioneer base has sunk into the ocean.
Wow, that's amazing! You can fly one of those!
Long ago?
After coming all the way out here to deliver it... I'm so sorry.
They were carried to him.
But maybe all of Aqua itself was made from a gentle miracle.
Bye!
Where are you going, President Aria?
Is it really that old?
HuhEh, wait, you want to go down that way?
Did you deliver it?
You're the only one who has noticed me.
I want it delivered so badly.
So just wait a little longer, okay?
A gift for you.
My, my, my!
You're really treat her like a little kid, don't you?
Yeah, I have it.
You ready to do this?
I'd rather you compare it to dolphins or mermaids or something.
Okay!
Is most of your work within Neo-Venezia?
That's right, most of it.
q2But when you Undines guide people in your gondolas, your job is to create those precious feelings.
We make precious feelings?
Right!
Where do you suppose the base is?
I borrowed it from the florist.
Maybe that letter was mailed before news of the accident reached the writer,
And the year he died is the same as the cancel stamp on the letter.
Letters really do carry your feelings beyond time and space, don't they?
Please come to the second Sparkling Beach to the right...
Hm? That way?
What's wrong?
Are you serious?
Of course.
No sappy lines allowed!
All the Undines have finally arrived!
This is a desert island after all.
First, change into your swimsuits!
Alice, you're too scared of making a mistake.
The last exercise will be a competitive race!
I made us some boxed lunches.
This is delicious, Alicia-san!
My, my!
Let's go, Akari!
Wow, it's so high.
I'm kind of tired...
But still...
And then what happened...?
It's such a strange feeling...
Aika-chan, don't you think
You can't take food that's too hot, can you, Akari?You have a cat's tongue, don't you, Akari-chan?
This is great!
Don't you know about Akira-san's grilled rice balls?
an2OyHey!!
Who are you saying cooks like a man?!
You think so?
It's already after school hours.
Can you believe that?
Oh, he's coming this way.
What?
Will that be all?
No.
Oh, Tachibana.
It's Yamamoto!
Didn't you see him when you were out practicing?
Like middle-aged guys?
It's probably going to be hard this time.
Hello.
Pardon me. Good grief.
Yui.
If I were to pick someone from here,
The manager? No way!
You should serve the food for table six.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Here. You can use my spare umbrellas.
Wow!
Maybe you have something that you want?
I-I'm not glaring at you.
ED
I used to have one when I was little.
What? You're going to walk there on your own?
That's dangerous.
Hey.
It's ready.
Does your mom know that you're here?
Nope!
Did you really make that?
I need a tissue!
This is what I like.
Well, come to think of it,
the other day I did go see a movie for the first time in ages.
What is this?!
Tsubu?
Mom said we can't keep him.
I'll think about it, then.
Oh, where's your shirt?
Where's Tsubu?
Does your dad like to read books?
Apparently, he likes a certain kind of literature.
You came to pick me up?
Here's an umbrella.
Manager.
Hello.
Mine was a winter white hamster.
Oh, thanks!
an8What? Are you guys talking about Tsubu?
Come to think of it, I might still have the heater too.
Kubo, his name isn't Butsu. It's Tsubu.
an8currently having the best conversation with my staff since I became manager?!
It's okay, I know where daddy's house is!
I'd be worried sick!
I can take him there.
Where'd this rice omelet come from?
Yep!
That's amazing.
Hm... okay.
Gimme a tissue!
What?
I'm sorry. Why don't you keep him at your mom's?
Thanks.
Careful not to slip!
I want to learn more about you.
Hiya boss!
Yeah?
Yeah! I just make sure to breathe through my mouth when I talk to him.
i1Come to think of it, I feel like lately I've been happier than usual. I wonder why?
Well, she's not wrong.
Aren't you gonna say hi?
Then let's say hi.
I figured.
Nope.
The line was so long that I thought I'd wet myself for the first time in ages.
You're going to transfer to another school, Haruka?
Yeah.
Hey, what's this weird-looking key chain?
Um...
Part B
Because it feels good.
Huh?
Well, I think I kinda get what you mean...
Wait!
You don't usually read that much?
i1She couldn't have.
i1I wonder if photobooks count as reading.
I'll take you up on that offer, then.
Huh?
Thanks for the book.
You wouldn't believe how many people there were! I barely made it in time!
Why can't you commute here from there?
How many times are you going to try that machine?
Oh, sorry.
Wow, you're right!
Akira!
You know, I actually come here a lot.
It won't happen again!
After all, if that book ends up not pulling you in,
Still, the fact that you came here today even as an infrequent reader...
i1Huh?
i1Nah, there's no way.
They'll be due back in two weeks.
Well, thanks for the book.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Table three, order up.
Seriously, I can hardly stand to watch.
I'm sorry.
But I've got a recorder test tomorrow!
Sorry about that, Tachibana-san.
Forty-five years old, stuck in a dead-end management job, and
Please excuse the noise!
an8This is KBC, the Kazamizawa Broadcasting System.
All right, let's eat!
Is that how it is?
Yamamoto!
Well, I guess...
A guy who sometimes forgets to fix his hair...
Be quiet, Yoshizawa!
Really?
It's fine.
I'd suggest finishing up practice early today.
Yui-chan, what kind of guy is your type?
Oh.
Uh...
But if I'm not mistaken, the manager...
Huh?
Hello.
What?
That's incredible!
There are millions of people who read books.
Yeah.
Hello.
You just need to work a hundred times harder at washing the dishes.
Well, I don't think we'll be too busy since the weather is so bad, but I'm counting on you.
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay.
Hello.
What?
It's gone down a bit.
Did something happen at the restaurant?
I...
I'm sorry I said that.
I'm not the kind of adult you think I am.
Then why does my heart ache so much?!
Youthfulness can sometimes be rough and vicious.
Huh?
When I'm with you,
i1This feeling...
i1Right now, I'm the only one who can protect that.
Friends?
I wonder what happened.
For crying out loud...
It seems like the trains are still running!
i1Text it is.
i1"Can I text you?"
What do you think you know about me?
Good evening!
A cold?
Let's hang in there, Tachibana-san.
Clean it up later! For now, just make a new one. Hurry!
Huh?
Be careful or you'll lose yet another thing you enjoy.
It's crazy out there.
Tachibana-san,
and I don't have any achievements to be proud of.
Even though it's hard to imagine that now.
In fact, I'm grateful.
I'm so glad...
Absolutely ridiculous! The boss finally recovers from his cold, only for Tachibana-san to catch one!
But Manager! Will you be all right alone?
Friends...
i1A junior in high school.
Oh, of course, we can be friends
Actually, I don't think a manager and an employee should be friends.
Uh... This was...
Oh no!
It'll be great if you can do it after our shift today!
Akira, you're friends with Yoshizawa, right?
More like an acquaintance.
Even if it's one step at a time.
you'll gradually find more connections with him.
You're right!
Akira!
Oh, hi there.
They have it every year at the shrine near the station.
And the manager insists on putting them all up on the wall every year.
Thank you.
Actually, I like things that are yellow.
Give me a second!
I'm all right.
Then that's not the case.
but I want to play soccer as much as I can because I like it.
people's expectations of her must be high.
Above all,
try not to worry about it too much.
Last one!
What?
I'm sorry.
"In his faded blue robe, the man had settled on the topmost of the seven steps and,
Which part do you not understand?
I understand it, but...
A bad question?
What?
Oh, sorry.
In the previous version, it says the servant ran out into the rain toward the town to commit a robbery.
Yes!
New order.
Wait. No, I think managers should keep a professional distance from their employees.
Hiya Akira-chan!
Oh, I've got just the thing for that!
No, more like acquaintances?
As long as you can find common ground here and there,
I'll be heading back, then.
i1Summer...
Friends usually text each other, don't they?
I like anything bright and yellow!
One, two!
Besides, I thought you retired from the team, Yamamoto-senpai.
Hey, wait!
I don't see you with that girl much lately. The one with the intense eyes.
Anyway, bye.
Yeah, I'm good. Can't say it didn't hurt, though.
Oh, sorry. What class is it for?
You mean Akutagawa's Rashomon!?
Let's see here...
It's a lot of fun trying to imagine what's going on inside each character's head as you read a novel.
Huh?
Where does the story go from there?
There's no way to know what went on in Akutagawa's head,
i1The servant's pimple was a sign of his youth.
Lookin' sharp there!
Thanks for waiting.
No, that's okay.
Hey there!
You should've just said hi.
Me too.
an8I need to pee.
an8Hurry!
Seriously, he's such a smooth talker.
Here. Use this.
Haruka?
What?
No worries. I'm sorry too.
I'm supposed to meet a friend here.
Hey.
Donden's miso tofu balls!
I borrowed it from the library.
So how was it?
It's a masterpiece!
It was okay.
Ta-da!
It's the self-published magazine we made together in college.
Oh, that's Takada's page.
Oh, you found Midori's name?
How long have you been divorced?
And I made my debut as a writer with the novel I wrote while I was alone on that trip.
You still write novels, don't you?
No one around me knows that I secretly write novels.
Come on, drink!
I've had a bit too much to drink.
Kondou, I'll drop you off halfway.
No, I'll walk to sober myself up.
Again? This is the 18th time you've asked me that.
i1to that season of our youth.
There's no way I can tell from that.
Additional orders of french fries and fried chicken.
Okay!
I got into a fight with my friend.
but things have kind of gotten awkward between us since I had to quit the team.
Oh, okay.
I think I was able to feel that way because we've both matured.
I'll try an orange one.
Here you go!
Hurry!
Akira, what color are you going for?
Akira?
Akira.
"You could have just asked"?
Thank you!
Chihiro.
It definitely brings back memories.
Here you are!
Well...
On my way in here I ran into a young lady carrying your book.
Sure did.
Ta-daaa!
I know, right?
Ah, is that Midori-chan's?
We were so young back then...
I'm really just dabbling at this point.
Kondou.
Driver, start the car.
Hm?
i1I constantly long to return
Bet you'll never guess.
Hm?
i1Man, that miso glaze the other day was amazing.
but when I quit, things grew awkward between us...
Oh, um, okay.
We just met up the other day.
"We're not grownups. We're classmates."
That's true of you, and of your friend too. I'm sure of it.
an8This is Kamiooka Station.
McRonald's it is!
He must be popular in your class.
Oh no! The manager is acting strange!
Okay, your turn, Akira.
Pink gerbera daisies.
Pancakes with lots of whipped cream.
Huh? But what about the rest of the things that make your heart flutter?
We'll keep it for him.
Huh? What's wrong, Tachibana?
I'm in big trouble.
Will that be...
I'm promoted to manager?
No!
Come on, let's go to the hospital.
Sorry it's so cramped back there.
Can you take your socks off by yourself?
Oh dear.
Oh, it's not a problem.
Take care. I'll text you later.
No, it's fine.
i1I'm sorry that I didn't realize it earlier.
You're someone's daughter, and you got injured on my watch.
i1Maybe she didn't want me to come.
When it's your hand, it's called a manicure.
Oh, I see.
Here's your parfait with sticky rice balls and brown sugar syrup.
i1I...
Uh, okay.
Thank you very much.
We've got someone new starting in the kitchen today.
You got it, boss!
Yo, Tachibana!
i1Oh, I remember now. So that was Yoshizawa-kun back then!
Yeah. Just roll with it. Let the high school girl vibes wash over you.
Oh boy, so he's on a bike...
Well, I'm sure he'll come back for it.
She takes "run like the wind" to a whole new level!
Huh? Tachibana-san?
Better hope the manager doesn't see this.
Are you kidding!?
I'm all right. It's just that the hospital I've been going to isn't far from here.
Yes!?
Manager,
Absolutely not! Why would you think that!?
I'll come by and pick them up later.
It's just a bit of inflammation.
Seeing as their dearest daughter got injured on my account,
I was planning to give this to your parents as an apology.
and in the end, it caused more trouble for you by messing up the shifts.
Yes, it was only a minor injury.
Like maybe some blood blisters or something!
Blood blisters? That's ridiculous!
Well, I kinda got a sense of dj vu just now.
Like you'd seen it before? What do you
Gosh, what a relief!
There are quite a lot of stalls out here today.
Hey, old man!
Your store was closed when I was in Takadanobaba the other day.
I've grown old, so I don't work during the evenings anymore.
Oh, this is the owner of the secondhand bookstore I used to visit a lot when I was a student.
He's a French writer.
Oh, damn it!
It slipped my mind.
This is the first edition.
You're such a good salesman!
Oh, right!
So Akira isn't going to undergo rehab and return to the track and field team after all?
That's what she's saying.
The writer, Kujou Chihiro.
I've lived my life alongside novels.
i1It used to be like that for me too.
i1that became a one-sided love.
Yes.
I bought it just because of the title.
Not yet. It's a little too difficult for me.
No, you don't need to.
Make sure you take good care of it.
Is this...
What? Really?
Their droppings were terrible.
It made me anxious, but they all left their nest safely in the end.
I'm the worst person ever.
i1I want to be forgiven.
It's no problem at all! So, today...
l-like I said in my text,
um, since we're friends, I'd like you to help me pick out a book!
Well, what do you know! Never thought I'd see you with a stall out here!
I just close earlier now. I ain't as young as I used to be.
Whoa there sonny, do you mean to tell me this lovely young lady is your daughter?
She's not my daughter. We work toge
We're friends!
Friends, eh?
Short but sweet. Loaded with charm, too.
The very same. He was a French novelist.
so he sent his publisher a letter containing only a question mark.
with just an exclamation mark.
Oh, take a look in that section. I've got some stuff there that oughta tickle your fancy.
I think he'll be back soon.
I seem to recall he was a bit of a writer himself once.
A novelist?
I'm begging you, Pops! Just a tiny discount!
Huh? Hm...
That didn't take you long.
It doesn't seem like Akira-chan's interested in starting rehab to get back into track, is she?
Yeah, I guess not.
And that was our guest for today, Chihiro Kujou!
Hm?
Yes.
If...
Every day, for the rest of its life.
Sorry for rambling on like that.
Sheesh, I'm even more out of it today than I was at the book fair. I really am hopeless.
i1The swallows know it well.
i1I know it's different for everyone, even if it's the same injury.
They're all overreacting.
Wait.
Huh?
I'm here.
I brought something good today.
Right?
Much obliged, much obliged.
I was excited every day even though there was no guarantee.
because you know who I used to be.
Once it takes off, things won't stop.
I'm already this old.
There were a lot of things I couldn't solve with only my naive feelings.
i1had the same injury you had two years ago.
The swallow that truly gives up on flying
I'll be able to work.
Yeah.
You know, I would really hate to see Tachibana-senpai give up on running.
All right!
They're making such a big deal out of it! They're getting all worked up over nothing!
Hm? Oh, yeah, right after I finish this.
Boss! You're gonna get an earful from corporate if you're late to that meeting!
Honestly. Why not leave a little earlier instead of dragging his feet?
Whoops, gotta get going.
I'm leaving. Sorry, forget about my order.
Your book's getting made into a movie? Congratulations!
Thanks. Hey, where are you right now?
Hm? What kind?
I figured, so with one more click I got these!
Paper! Manuscript paper!
You dummy, I knew you had some.
"Watch out, Akutagawa, 'cause I'm comin' for you!
Man, can you believe I ever said that!?
That book is nothing more than pop-culture tripe. It's a piece of shit.
Literature should be a poison! Tell me you still understand that, Kondou!
It's not that you can't. It's that you won't.
What's really getting in your way is you. 
I'm already old. I can't go back to who I was back then.
i1two years ago, she got injured the same way as you.
Please wait!
See you at practice!
I shouldn't have said that to her.
Think carefully about it, and make sure you hand it in.
Will you promise me that you'll cut my hair?
Hello!
Really?
He's getting promoted.
He'll get transferred to the head office.
Seriously?!
Okay!
What were you doing?
At running.
Yippee!
He said he was going to practice every day,
I think he'll do it.
I remade it.
The one promise I made myself was to spend my life together with literature.
I want to fulfill that.
Perhaps...
What do you mean?
I'm so nervous.
Let's see the wind together.
Thanks. I really appreciate it.
Tachi
i1I won't forget.
See you later!
I wish I hadn't said that to her.
Career surveys?
Well, it's ordinarily pretty... ordinary.
Kinda makes you think like, "Wow, is it that time already?"
I'd sure love it if you'd cut my bangs again!
Eh? Sure!
Yeah!
During running.
What?
Yeah, I'm fine.
That's what Daddy says.
but I wanna be number one!
It brought me pain, but it taught me something valuable as well.
That was the promise I made to spend my life pursuing literature.
i1Do you also have a promise to yourself that hasn't been fulfilled yet, Tachibana-san?
Same.
You mean you're not being tested for a promotion?
Save your apologies for the customers!
I'll never forget.
How about taking this opportunity to exchange our usernames?!
He's always apologizing to the customers.
Hey.
You're young, so you need to eat plenty.
You'll shrink if you don't.
He's the manager's son.
Are you okay?
i1I think he has his father's eyes.
I see. That's great.
Sorry about that.
Part B
Akira, can we join you?
My belly and my back want to stick together...
Since I quit the team, I feel sluggish if I eat the same amount as before.
She shoots!
The soccer team is going to let us use the field.
What's your type?
I don't like Ootsuka because he's like a stone wall.
Oh, do you not like your coffee black?
I had no idea it was going to rain!
I didn't bring an umbrella.
See you guys tomorrow.
Tachibana, if you like
Do you happen to have one of those social media apps on your phone...
If you do have one...
an8i1I'm scared.
That's all.
Yo! Leave it to me!
i1I get it now.
Yes. I can feel the intense phytoncide coming from them.
Manager.
Doesn't your school have a track and field team?
You're making work difficult!
Oh, that's okay.
Take care of the restaurant for me!
Lie down on that bed.
Don't you need to go back to the restaurant?
You can't go back to work today, right?
Oh, it's not a problem.
But you need your clothes and school uniform, right?
I'll go back later to pick them up.
Yep, I'll be fine.
No, it's fine.
How come you're here?
What?!
Paint your toenails?
When it's your foot, it's called a pedicure.
Anyway, they're supposed to be pink, not red.
You're wearing something casual too.
i1I should've worn something nicer today.
You probably didn't need to go all the way to where Garden is to find a part-time job.
i1it.
Let's order more!
Excuse me!
i1Was I supposed to say it differently?
It's literally my savior.
She's right.
Uh...
Kyan!
Akira?
No thanks. I'll pass.
Hey, how about going there today, then?
The teacher said we can use the starter pistol.
Come on, hurry!
Tachibana?
I like you.
I like you.
i1What kind of attitude should I have toward her?
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
i1Maybe it's a prank!
i1That's right.
i1At any rate, it sure is an awful thing.
Tell your mother that it was my pleasure.
My leg is still recovering, and I seem to have a cold, as well as a fever.
Too bad, Yoshizawa. Akira can't join us.
Um, you're going toward Yokohama, right?
"Why not"?
Tachibana, I'm 45.
i1That tastes awful!
i1The smell of wet leaves.
Yeah, on a date...
You said I should go on a date with you, right?
the Rashomon could've been sheltering at least a few others from the rainperhaps a woman in a lacquered reed hat,
an8Hello.
You've said that before.
Manager, you have Saturday off?
Uh, well...
What do you want for your meal?
I'd like a sandwich, please.
i1Tachibana Akira.
i1A junior in high school.
i1She's calm for her age and is impassive most of the time.
Please don't tell anyone.
Well, I guess I can keep it a secret.
Excuse me?
You went back home once to get changed?
She's no longer the Angelica we once knew!
I'm leaving.
i1Is this a good time to talk?
That's my advice.
Part B
i1This is the correct meeting place, right?
Manager.
Oh, I have a different hair style than usual.
Shall we go, then?
Okay.
Nathan, run!
I'd like to have something to drink.
Uh, um...
I'm sorry that I'm such an old man.
Yeah.
i1It's full of young people.
Oh, hi there.
Bye then.
You said it was a boring movie.
Tsubu!
That's dangerous.
Um...
My shift is almost over, so I'll go with him.
Pardon the intrusion.
Sorry about the mess, but please make yourself at home.
What are you gonna make?
Huh?
I don't know whether to scold him or praise him.
Did you really make that?
Do you have plans to go anywhere?
I wanna do radio calisthenics!
so there's no way I can have pets.
A frog!
Manager!
an8Oh, that hamster? His name is Butsu, right?
Yep, but it's all right because I breathe through my mouth when I speak to him.
Back to work.
i1Does your dad like to read books?
an8Hey!
Are you gonna buy anything?
Let's go have tea somewhere.
That's what I thought too,
You do too, right?
Yeah.
Seriously?
It's true!
I got this from...
You're too fast!
Akira!
Catch this!
Wait...
Oh?
What?
I'll never shout again.
Luckily, this is the biggest library in Yokohama.
i1Maybe I should've asked him differently.
Please return them to the counter over here.
Thanks for the book.
i1Maybe I was the one who was called there.
i1Chihiro...
ED
i1I wish I could say something to him at times like this.
Oh yeah...
You can use the messenger app on a flip phone too.
Really?
Let's forget about this idea.
i1The manager probably won't be able to use the messenger app properly, so we can text instead.
Souseki writes in a colloquial style, so it's easy to read regardless of age.
The author is an acquaintance of mine.
That's incredible!
Yeah, kind of.
Wow, it's awesome that you have a friend like that.
You know nothing about me.
I'm off to work.
What? There's a typhoon coming.
Can't you take the day off?
A cold?
Oh, okay.
You must be tired, Tachibana.
He's obviously feeling uncomfortable.
I'm sorry I said that.
Anyone can see that you're a wonderful person!
When I'm with you,
i1Still,
i1and something you shouldn't touch just from the sense of nostalgia.
Honestly!
I'm off to work.
Text me if you want anything.
Okay.
Friends...
What are you going on about?
OP
What?
you'll gradually find more connections with him.
You like sunflowers and curry?
i1Even if we're only friends right now, I'm sure that one day...
Also, didn't you retire from the soccer team, Yamamoto?
No.
I did grow apart from soccer because of my injury and the exams,
I see. Homework for your remedial class, huh?
This is a bad question.
I was told the answer to this question won't affect my grade.
That person was an old woman who was pulling out the hair of the dead.
Basically, she was doing it to survive.
A sequel...
I never thought about it.
I want to avoid causing trouble as much as I can.
What?
i1I'm just a middle-aged man who can't even get pimples anymore.
Manager!
Yes!
Let's go.
Okay!
an8Hurry!
Akira.
I don't think it's pathetic.
Why don't you stop by during
He's so old!
I mean, is the boy who's with him his...
I don't know what you're thinking at all.
How come you guys are crying?
There, there. Don't cry.
Wait!
Takadanobaba hasn't changed.
No worries. I'm sorry too.
This was our favorite place.
You bought a copy?
I borrowed it from the library.
What do you mean, "it wasn't too bad"?!
Ta-da!
I haven't actually finished writing one in four or five years.
I guess we are middle-aged men after all.
I'll walk.
I can't walk anymore!
I'm gonna take the cab.
The station isn't far from here.
You're sulking.
Let's go to the next place!
I have some souvenirs!
Here are the orders.
Hi.
What's a supermoon?
Some people say it can make your wishes come true.
It's not like we got into a fight or anything,
I'm sure you've shared moments together that are irreplaceable.
i1Even if I feel anxious...
i1about us growing apart right now,
Sorry for being late.
I'm hoping you can recommend some books for me, as my friend.
Your store was closed when I was in Takadanobaba the other day.
She's not my daughter.
He was worried about the sales of his book,
so he sent a letter to the publisher that contained only a question mark.
Come to think of it, you'd probably like the books over there.
Oh, looks like he got carried away and wandered off somewhere.
What? No can do!
What?
Did you see that yesterday?
I think your wound has healed.
Yes.
It's not just about her physical condition.
It made me anxious, but they all left their nest safely in the end.
I'm doing the same thing I did at the bookfair.
I'd like to hear your words more,
i1I want to be forgiven.
As soon as I finish typing this.
Oh, thanks.
Jeez, why does he always leave at the last second?
I won't need anything else.
I wouldn't be able to bear it!
Part B
I wanted to surprise you.
You're so weird.
That's true.
I'd rather not say.
Ta-da!
Manuscript paper.
Here.
What kind of seed did they bring?
Reminds you of your student days, doesn't it?
Does siphon coffee drip in one minute to begin with?
I can't believe I used to say stuff like that!
Just kidding!
It's exciting because you can't see what's ahead.
i1In that case,
i1does it mean I can find my way there one day?
The swallow that truly gives up on flying
Akira!
Hey!
Hi.
I don't have anything else I want to do!
All rise.
See you guys later!
It's amazing that you know what you want to do, Nishida.
Come to think of it, he's been going to the head office a lot recently.
Wait, is he...
That'd never happen.
Track and field?
Huh?
Your legs will move more when you do that.
I appreciate it.
That's what he promised you.
I added a promise to a promise I can't fulfill.
Haruka, wait.
Finally.
He's actually going to be promoted.
Take a look. This.
So we'll be the only branch that won't get to launch the new menu yet.
Run!
That's a promise!
I'm so sorry.
i1What does he mean by "thanks"?
That must mean that you're snapped in half.
Go ahead, ask away.
Huh?
Akira! Ishii set a new personal best!
Oh, come to think of it, you're working at a diner, right?
Good idea!
an8No.
Tachibana, you're really fast.
Get set!
What's wrong?
Thanks.
i1It seems to be the same as usual.
i1What a letdown.
i1I'm disappointed because it's as if nothing has happened.
Let's post this online!
Manager.
I'd like to know your answer.
We haven't had a welcome party for Yoshizawa yet.
i1Something tells me that this isn't a dream nor a prank.
Let's go, then.
I don't.
i1She seems to be able to run a little bit.
I like you, Manager.
You should reconsider all this.
You don't get it at all.
It's not even lunch time yet.
Let's lend her an ear, ladies!
Awww, poor widdle baby!
And to think her leg boo-boo was starting to feel better, too!
Akira?
Hey, you heading out?
Aw, don't be like that, Senpai!
That reminds me! You work at a restaurant now, right?
Tachibana-san?
Yeah, welcome back.
Welcome back, Akira-chan!
i1Or maybe... it was one of those hidden camera pranks!
This is hilarious! Quick, let's upload it!
i1What else would a 17 year-old girl want with me?
Sure, but listen
Well, I'm imagining it now!
I guess I did say that...
You said I should go on a date with you, right?
Oh, that was just a hypothetical...
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you want for your meal?
i1What was she looking at?
Oh, that.
It's on the house.
Hey.
Hello.
Thank you for the meal.
You shouldn't doodle during class.
You went back home once to get changed?
Tachibana, you run track, right?
Hey, we finally established eye contact.
You call this a date?
i1Oh. It's Kondou from the Garden.
You like him that much?
That's my advice.
This seems like an intense movie.
Yeah, it's fine.
Part B
i1Oh, I need a smoke.
i1Maybe I'll go smoke for a little bit.
Oh, I have a different hair style than usual.
Shall we go, then?
I can't come to watch a movie like this when I'm with Yuuto.
Did you like it, Tachibana?
What? Uh...
Huh? Forty-five.
an8I don't need any sugar!
Don't worry about it.
i1What's with this caf?
I'll see you at the Garden then.
On the thick column, its crimson lacquer rubbed off here and there, perched a cricket.
might have been expected to be waiting there for a break in the rainstorm.
Hey, afternoon.
Yes, certainly! Just like you said, sir.
I-If you insist.
You have to promise.
Dude, that's nuts!
Hey Kase-san, wait 'til you hear this! Ootsuka-san spent
We'll take non-smoking.
I enjoy working at the restaurant.
Wonder who's calling.
Let's see...
Welcome home.
i1Damn, I could use a smoke right now.
Manager!
I thought you went to the nail salon!
Run, Nathan! She's not the Angelica you knew any more!
Certainly.
one of these... Kiliman...jaros? This coffee, hot.
What, me? Uh, 45...
i1What's with this place?
Um...
Look around you
It's full of noise You can't see me but you hear me loud
Don't that make you crazy now Don't that make you crazy now
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Ah ah...
What is it, Sanae?
My sister is amazing.
to earn all the money she needs to raise Makoto herself.
I'm home!
Are you saying I can't even save my game?
You haven't left the house in a while.
It's okay. Leave it to me.
Makoto is cute.
OUTSIDE LINE CALL KOMADORI PRESCHOOL
KOMADORI PRESCHOOL
That's not funny.
You're my senior, right?
Uh... Well...
Hey, you!
EFFORT
So bring me the ransom money.
There's that public apartment complex, right? The one they're going to demolish.
Be there in 30 minutes with the money before 7:20.
Would you get there on time by bike?
It's my fault...
There's one thing I have to tell you.
A story about the people who entered this world.
We're here.
Juri!
Juri, you carry Makoto.
Let's carry the chair too. It'll be faster.
Accepting momentary despair Good night
That old man can control it, right?
Hey! Come back!
Don't that make you crazy now Don't that make you crazy now
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Well, I wasn't in top shape a minute ago.
What's the point in splitting up our strength?
Protecting Makoto is my job!
Even with this body, I'm able to move as easily as I could before.
Oh, really?
and who's controlling that thing, is you, Makoto.
Well, that's only natural.
Makoto?
Hey, Juri!
Hey!
This movement isn't of his own will.
He's being controlled by someone.
It's the kid.
Bull's-eye!
If they keep chipping away at me like this, I'm in danger.
That guy's stomach. It's being eaten.
More importantly, follow them! Hurry!
and remain here alone?
Your grandpa over there would be sad.
I'll let you out
No. I think of myself as just a normal human being.
Every religion has a pillar,
Good morning.
The child from one of the member families
They'll find out by the smell that we used soap.
Inside the bowl called me There's nothing it's so boring
I didn't even know your name There was no need for words
Ever-changing memory is therapy
It dried up and vanished in the morning
Coming in Coming out
Look around you
Crazy now Crazy now
We're about to get all the money and women we could ever want!
Junji.
He knows that.
I don't see any extra dust.
Give this to the doctors!
The doctors? You mean...? No, hold on--
What's wrong, Takafumi?
How much time has passed?
You're right.
of airborne particles that have been concentrated from over a wide area.
Even if he was able to draw in some organic material, I don't think he'd last long.
Let's hide the evidence and the dead bodies.
Well, all he has to do is dig. We'll be the ones who'll bury them.
Are you hurt somewhere?
I want to go home soon.
Well, you should have asked us about it first.
This is...
-What are you going to do? -What do you mean?
It only needs to touch the threads and reveal them.
Majima!
-Are you okay? I'm coming right now! -No!
Probably.
his life will probably
can ever...
You're gone
Let's all go home together.
I mixed it with my fingers directly.
What are you planning to do?
Youre going to let him live because you cant kill him?
How do you know?
Theres nothing left for us to do here anymore.
Right. And I dont really want to see you anymore,
THE TWELFTH MOMENT
Oh... Whats wrong? Hmm?
Oh, he stopped crying.
DEAR MOM AND DAD,
Well. Its nice going on trips sometimes.
You used to ride this the whole time whenever we came here.
Okay.
Yeah. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please forgive me.
Okay, okay.
Im starting to understand you.
I want you to believe that youll go back someday.
How about living with me here like this?
This is about right.
No, there's no way.
My body is being pulled.
Uh...
Oh, I know that name.
He wanted to have a body like mine.
But after a while, he started to become more interested in research than his original goal.
-Please be careful not to miss this train. -My feet hurt...
Juri, welcome home!
Makoto and the others are waiting outside.
Crazy now crazy now
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Ah ah...
Flashback
The First Moment
What is it, Sanae?
Okay, I got it.
Are you saying I can't even save my game?
I can't play Rpgs in the living room anymore.
You haven't left the house in a while.
last hope for raising a decent adult in this family.
You don't know him?
-Ms., -Yes?
I'm sorry.
He doesn't have a driver's license.
Don't you remember me?
What are you talking about at a time like this?
There's not enough time!
I'm going to go so at least Makoto can get away.
-One minute, okay? -Put your hand on The Stone.
Don't you want to save those two?
They're already here.
Hey! Dad!
What? I've never heard that before.
What's going on here?
Stasis?
You mean like the Mc on Tv or at parties?
Grandpa, do you mean...?
People start off stealing coins. then they move to bills,
They sounded different from how these guys look.
It's open.
We'll think about what to do next later.
-Let's pull it backwards. -Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go!
Who are you?
If you can't go through with it, just go home!
Juri!
Damn!
Ever-changing memory is therapy
You're gone
However, The Master Stone is necessary for using the true power.
Our teachings have been passed down since the Meiji Period.
Well then.
Coming in coming out
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Don't stop no turning back Flashback
Stop!
What are you hesitating for? this was the plan from the beginning!
It's disappearing...
Did the spell wear off?
Hey, that's right! Grandpa, that thing!
Even if we tried, they'd be left behind.
In the end, the doctrine of The Genuine Love Society has been demonstrated.
They got away...
After they search for a while, I'll call them back so we have enough people here. Is that good?
It must have been misinformed and changed when it was passed down.
They got smaller...
We can bring back Tsubasa and Makoto In a Stasis where those guys don't exist.
How do you do it? Instant teleportation. can I do it too?
What do you mean by "how"?
Majima? Ever since she joined half a year ago, she's been sizing us up.
We talked about why the body of The Herald
Isn't it just a coincidence?
I was at an interview today, right?
We could be breaking the rules without knowing,
Who... Who is he?
What are you doing?
What?!
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
What have you been doing up until now?
I see. I didnt know that the second daughter had such powers.
I see.
Thats scary
This is the guy were supposed to kill, right?
The Herald doesnt just diffuse it disappears.
-Lets talk inside. -Okay.
Tsubasa
Did you have a bad dream? that must be it
Kids adapt to new things so easily.
How come Dad was over there?
The phone call for the ransom wasnt that long ago.
Are you okay, Tsubasa?
Yeah. Right.
What are you saying? You idiot!
But according to Majima, the Specter was expelled from the guys body
right after the second daughter touched his chest.
About your home situation, your economic situation, and your lifestyle.
It was today.
What are you doing?
Well
Damn, look at yourself, you old bastard!
She wasnt at the apartment.
Now we just have to save Takafumi, like we originally planned.
Shake Shake Shaken Empty
Autumn passes right by
Now we just have to save Takafumi, like we originally planned.
Well, yeah...
I see.
Anyways, lets go home for now.
Wait.
Yes. Ive thought about it so many times that Ive lost count.
Run away! Run away!
-Shit! -What's that?! You think the two of you can take us on?!
And after that...
Whats wrong?
When someone dies, what happens to the jellyfish inside their body?
What a low-life...
Well... Im not sure. Sorry...
Well, even if he did have a change of heart, It would still be unrealistic.
Im not sure.
We could live out the rest of our lives with a healthy diet--
Oh. Then I made the wrong call. Sorry.
-You making a fool of me? -Nope, I'm not.
Like this!
Hey. Its dangerous...
Dont get close...
It wont move anymore.
He wasnt eaten.
This is a person who gave up control of his body to the Specter,
Theyre the forms of humans who have transformed into inhabitants of Stasis.
The Herald marks the intruder
the whereabouts of The Master Stone,
And others ridiculed for being old-fashioned.
But once we get our hands on The Master Stone,
The world is going to change. No, this will change the world!
There is no need for more words of teaching now.
If you don't, I'll stab this kid!
My grandpa told me that The Handler appears when someone tries to break the rules of Stasis.
and then they would attack us.
There's no way that could happen.
-We can get Tsubasa and Makoto back... -No, it's impossible.
Dad?
Yeah. Stay back. It's better if you didn't see this.
Hey, stand up.
The Herald looked just like the description in The Great Circle Scriptures.
It must have been misinformed and changed when it was passed down.
That's so unreliable.
On the other hand, we should acknowledge our findings
We infiltrated that single frame, and are moving around in it.
What do you mean by "how"?
There isn't really a way to do it.
the information she gave us was valuable.
That's what we hired them for.
The hospital...
I was at an interview today, right?
But then...
Then this will all be over.
What does this mean?
Damn! I'm such a fool.
NEXT MOMENT
As her consciousness fades away and she faces death,
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Excuse me, uh...
What are you talking about?
This feels so good.
Mom?
Yosuke!
Like thanks for letting me out of Stasis?
So you were planning to... use that girl...
Yes.
Kato-san, you said even if we cant leave Stasis, we can still survive, right?
Youre the one asking us for a favor,
Then its settled.
Do as you like, Sako.
Wait... come back!
That old man even hid the Stasis spell from his own family.
If we had the Stasis spell,
Then we have to retreat for now!
I see. that was unexpectedly fast...
I didnt want Sagawa to get curious about my family.
Sako-san.
without crossing the permitted boundaries, the Heralds wont do anything.
then we would have seen Heralds of this size many times already...
Its like leftovers! or is this one a reject?
All right, hand me your knife.
what I meant was that I want to take their bones back with me.
What did you say?!
Don't talk to me about resolve!
Grandpa...
Painful happiness comes over me
Ever-changing memory is therapy
Next Moment
Look up realizing it's all past
Hey, you!
Grandpa!
Juri! Stop Tsubasa! get the jellyfish out of him!
I feel the Specter flowing through me just like I feel my blood flowing through my veins.
Those guys can use instant teleportation.
It cant be helped.
Im going to summon The Handler.
-Shut up, Takafumi! -Okay, I got it...
It was just coincidence that we happened to have The Stone that night.
You said youd help Tsubasa!
Makoto!
Are you relieved?
Stay back.
Ive never been able to jump where I wanted.
Youre so stupid, auntie Juri.
They havent appeared yet.
Junji Sagawa
I think it'd be better to start over later.
-Its still alive! -Im going to ride it next time!
Expel it from the big one too!
Dont you want your grandson anymore?
Painful happiness comes over me
Don't be doubtful again I've been patient I wonder if you'll give me your heart one day
Hey, where's my little sister?
Hey, hey.
What's with that face?
White Sesame Tantanmen Noodles sora Sora
Well, you can do that after you take your brother to the hospital first.
But, do you think you could beat those guys on your own?
At the moment, I'm trying hard not to strangle you to death,
Start with the area around the Yukawa family's house.
First of all, four of them are disciples from the Society.
Sagawa is extremely curious about Stasis.
I still don't know what he's after, even though I had close contact with him.
The eldest son... I thought he was one of The Stalled.
Is that passed down to each generation through their genes?
Our members all believe the world would be a better place with the Stasis spell.
If you help me, I will leave you in charge of The Genuine Love Society.
What would you do if I leave its future up to you?
Oh, right.
Something unusual?
Nothing happened.
It couldn't be helped. we can't teleport wherever we want.
I have the duty, determination, and the brains needed to restore the Yukawa family!
But you want to seal away the Stasis spell?
The Heralds aren't the result, they're the process.
No, no. It was nothing.
If you're not interested In making the world a better place,
You eavesdropped on our conversation?
At all moments, it prevents the world from becoming distorted.
I'm going to make the doctrine come true.
What is it like to be completely controlled by a Specter?
Fatigue and emptiness meaningless morals and hesitation
What is it like to completely control the Specter?
Complete control over the Specter
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Look up realizing it's all past
Ah ah...
Complete control over the Specter
Heralds protect The Stalled, but lack the instinct to defend themselves.
What is the main characteristic of a Herald, Yamai?
You dont know?
-You monster! -Sagawa!
The first is whether or not there are any Heralds here in Stasis now.
and that Im completely free from the constraints of The Heralds.
You, who were used to Stasis from the moment you were born.
A sign of life!
Theres a toy store here.
Wait.
So?
Why did you bring the eldest son here?
And here I thought you were going to use me to check for Heralds again.
Did Stasis make Sagawa evolve?
Did this man change Stasis?
Lets go outside to talk.
If you want to survive, then join us.
Useless negotiations wont work with me.
-But... -Well, this guy wont scan the barcode.
I sent my unmarried daughter to the frontlines
Of course no one would listen to me.
Grandpa. Ill go check, and if it's not going well,
But if we place our weight on something floating in the air,
That was bad just now.
-How is it? -I think its enough.
So he was a backup hostage?
Why did Sagawa retreat so soon?
Huh?
Whats the point in taking something like that?
If they use The Stone and leave, thats better for us.
Not thinking much seeing where the city will take me
Juri resists in vain.
I can't believe I'm going to die.
Crazy
Look up realizing it's all past
Ah ah...
If everything goes according to Sagawa's plan,
You're right. From Sagawa's point of view, the old man is probably the biggest nuisance.
Without instant teleportation, the second daughter Is like a nuclear warhead without a rocket.
If we lose you, then the rest of us will fall like dominoes.
Sagawa won't go easy on them just because they're children.
We should get The Stone back as soon as possible.
Grandpa!
Hey!
What? That's impossible. we don't even know where it is.
The weight, the shape and the color.
That's right. The Stone itself can be considered a location...
Stop.
Everything's back.
Shiomi!
Did you break it?
I wasn't sure if that would stop it, but I still...
We can leave Stasis.
Stop joking around!
That's what I suddenly decided to do.
He's pretty high-powered, isn't he? Damn!
I'd say his weakness is the fact that he has to be careful about replenishing nutrients.
That's the part I don't understand.
By having the Specters enter our bodies,
Just like how this world only represents a single instant too short to even notice
He wants to move to the future.
No. I'm just an ordinary person.
It has nothing to do with us!
I'm not going to give up!
Stay back! Stop!
It stopped.
Is this...?
A special power, like what Juri and Dad have?
Oh, Juri!
Maybe the fact that Sagawa turned into a Herald Is having an effect on Stasis.
Here we go. Climb up over there!
I saw on the side of your face what looked to be love
It dried up and vanished in the morning
What do you think about using that thing to fight Sagawa?
Great! This is it!
It's full of noise you can't see me but you hear me loud
Crazy now crazy now
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
Well, I wasn't in top shape a minute ago.
I have the same request.
I want at least Makoto to be safe.
You can scream at me as much as you want later.
What?
I can do it! even if I'm far away, I can do it!
And let your daughter bear the brunt of the attack?
What's the point in splitting up our strength?
I'm going to use this Handler to protect my grandson.
No matter what your plan is, It's better to make a decision soon.
He moved!
Which way?
This is it! This is it, my time has come!
Don't worry, Makoto. your future is bright!
That's what this means.
Are they bluffing?
It stopped?
I thought I told you not to go alone!
This movement Isn't of his own will.
I see.
I have to finish off that kid controlling the Herald first.
I'll let you live just a little longer.
-It really was him. -Well, the cat's out of the bag.
Makoto! Just keep him there!
His body got bigger?
He looks so thin.
-Grab him. -Yeah!
If they run away, chase them.
There's something to eat...
I'm okay.
-Get away! It's scared! -I can't say the same for him, though.
-I won't let him get away. -Juri!
I'll get you back to the original world.
Don't let him trick you!
Now that you mention it, you did use to be a priest.
I'm just a normal person who couldn't even go insane.
I'm going to talk to you about faith and people's hearts.
An invisible pillar that supports people and that supports morality.
I washed it, but it won't come off.
I didn't.
I'm glad you're here, junji.
It dried up and vanished in the morning
It's full of noise you can't see me but you hear me loud
Don't stop no turning back Flashback
Ah ah...
Quit fooling around!
If I do it a few more times, I think I could expel them.
I don't want you to get your hands dirty.
Are you saying you wouldn't?
Justice is served.
Seriously? He just charged straight in and stabbed him.
has been concentrated into those thin threads?
If that's the case...
What if he's restoring his body Inside that thing?
Even if he was able to draw in some organic material, I don't think he'd last long.
There's no sign of movement from Sagawa right now.
She's not mad?
He'll be okay. this will be his good-luck charm.
It's nothing.
wants to see Sanae.
If not now, I won't be able to say goodbye.
Listen to your mom.
I know he wanted to go home,
but this guy was valuable in battle.
Don't call him "this guy."
Hey, everyone.
Come over here and look.
No way. Is he getting nutrients through the threads?
Majima!
You're right.
This is the egg of a monster.
You're gone
Let's all go home together.
wed be talking about the realm of spirits and grudges.
Well, if thats how it is...
Right. and I dont really want to see you anymore,
Crazy
Don't stop no turning back Flashback

Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
The impact force created by your power Is pretty big.
Lets go get some.
Notes: find Hot Water For Milk
Youre the only one who can smooth things over.
Dont try to push me suddenly from behind, like you did before.
Okay.
-Hey. -Huh?
and be able to leave Stasis.
Im going to start...
Grandpa.
Huh? What? are you going to help me out?
This sound means youre worried or youre lonely.
Which one?
Okay, okay.
This sound means youve pooped.
If I believed that, would it stop me from worrying?
Thats good enough.
Hey, you.
I sent the baby over there today.
I didnt notice until now!
I should feel privileged.
No depressing
Was that a hallucination?
Whats that?
-Huh? -You surprised me.
Huh? Huh?!
You made quite a fortune, right?
I cant believe it.
Dont forget it.
Inside the bowl called me there's nothing it's so boring

What are you doing? Dont let her go!
As long as youre sure that you can leave Stasis with your own will,
Being ejected from Stasis by force seems to involve a lot of pain.
Right. You know about it too, right?
What could this mean?
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF FEAR  PTSD  SOCIAL PHOBIA
In total, three people have joined The Stalled with blood dripping from their noses.
Here.
Well, it was
What?
Damn, look at yourself, you old bastard!
She wasnt at the apartment.
Sorry.
Inside the bowl called me There's nothing it's so boring
You're gone
Juri failed to rescue Makoto and reflected on the hopelessness
What--
Ive been in this stopped world when I was a kid.
Gaze at this world It's all upside down
Ah, ah...
Its just like hes dead!
That means its time to say bye to your grandpa.
Andres going to stay stopped like this.
My arm!
No, what I should be wondering is...
If youve forgotten about it, then its for the best...
But its the other way around.
Grandpa! Grandpa?!
No, no, no. Im going first.
Scary...
The old man and the bitch--
Stay back!
Hey, Grandpa. Theres something I want to ask you.
There might have been...
Lets hide Makoto and Tsubasa somewhere else.
Wheres Makoto? Did they move him somewhere else?
Yeah... well...
Youd need money to fund your activities.
If we dont have The Master Stone, which the second daughter took with her,
Well, let me put it this way.
We didnt know that the second daughter had the power to expel others from Stasis.
He wasnt eaten.
He was eaten away.
Theyre the forms of humans who have transformed into inhabitants of Stasis.
Its like Stasis itself has a will.
But theres a possibility that other Heralds exist in Stasis as well.
Well, you look pretty calm.
Aegis!
Excuse me!
What are you talking about?
No, that was something else.
Stay back!
Hm? Yeah.
Dont lose that determination.
I never meant to do that.
You bastard!
Are they really going to show up?
Can I talk to that girl?
Those arent people who can be reasoned with!
Theyre gone.
You said humans end up as Handlers.
Lets eat pudding when we get home!
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Of course, the settlement will be fake.
I plan to capture the Grandpa when he shows up.
Got it.
The Herald died already, right?
Lets try it.
Its like leftovers! Or is this one a reject?
Do they really exist just to protect The Stalled?
Ow...
Of course, I dont! Anyway, we cant do anything now.
If the three of us run away, theyd chase after us and try to kill us for sure.
Damn. I got wet.
Pudding! Pudding!
You're gone
NEXT MOMENT
Juri was able to rescue Takafumi.
Crazy now Crazy now
Look up Realizing it's all past
Ah ah...
Makoto...
Makoto...
Did they go easy on you in return?
and they'd use you as bait to lure us out.
People who fool around too much in this world end up as Heralds.
Makoto...
Grandpa!
Look!
His body hasnt changed...
The Handlers have white jellyfish in their bodies, just like us.
I got it. Im not sure if Ill be able to help, but Ill try.
Hey, knock it off!
Im okay with that.
Keep your promise.
No... Im going to stay with you.
I got it.
No, not yet.
Theyre right in front of you!
Take a break...
-who you dont feel any hatred for! -Huh? What are you doing?
-Hurry up and run away! -You can do it!
Its so far!
Did it really?
He saw me.
Dont you want your grandson anymore?
Shut up! Kiddies have to watch from up here!

Don't that make you crazy now Don't that make you crazy now
Too fast I feel torn Ah ah...
That's good news.
You don't have to feel responsible for any of this.
I'm the one to blame.
If I continue to be a pawn of The Genuine Love Society,
But right now, I still want allies.
We're going to search for The Master Stone zone by zone.
Start with the area around the Yukawa family's house.
And Shiomi, the expert on hidden video cameras and wiretapping.
And the last one is The Great Lord of The Genuine Love Society, Sagawa.
but he used his own body in an experiment to summon The Heralds.
Is that passed down to each generation through their genes?
The key is the mental condition of the person whom the Specter inhabits.
I agree.
who use the Stasis spell like a toy.
Grandpa, I'm thirsty!
It'll make you throw up.
It already existed as a KO 200 years ago.
Before we head to their headquarters, I want to go back home first.
If nothing happened, then never mind.
Even if it does involve some risks!
All this trouble happened because Dad slipped up!
You guys from The Genuine Love Society can make the world a better place with the Stasis spell.
But you want to seal away the Stasis spell?
It might not necessarily have been left here.
EFFORT RYOGOKU SUMO HALL
but they're a detailed record of the reality The Founder saw,
went even further.
At all moments, it prevents the world from becoming distorted.
It is the power that supports the world.
Crazy now Crazy now
We dont have to decide right now about forbidding the Stasis spell--
Well, here goes.
Yeah. You killed him.
Well, Mr. Tanabe, how about you?
There are two things I want to check.
The first is whether or not there are any Heralds here in Stasis now.
The second is whether or not I react to the intent to kill
Two... One!
What?! What are you doing?
Itll be okay. Tsubasa isn't going to die.
I have to get my hands on The Master Stone.
Wheres Juri?
So?
Shiomi is participating in this just for the compensation.
was just a choice he made to save himself from dying.
Then do you need some soy sauce?
She might have done it because there were no Heralds,
Hey!
It is, isn't it?
The reverse feels like strengthening yourself, confirming yourself,
or gathering the Specters to the center of your body.
So you got big just now
How did he learn to control the Specters within such a short amount of time?
Someone is downstairs.
Lets go outside to talk.
If you're going to join us, then stay right there.
You fool.
If you have 10 times the manpower, then surround them.
I should've guessed, you guys are useless.
-What did you say? -Quiet!
the fact that youre able to stand on top of that
Exactly.
We can spend our time looking for The Stone afterward.
Even if they dont leave, that doesnt change our goal to defeat them.
Have you ever tried it without placing your hands on it?

The next episode, "The Ninth Moment."
I can't believe this.
That was supposed to be the job of those other pieces of trash.
I don't want to die.

Isn't there any way to stop this?
I wonder how far they went.
Grandpa, how are you? Are you okay?
You broke The Stone? Are you serious?
That applies to me, too.
will only lead to an early death.
It's probably best you just make yourself useful.
he can sense your presence and tell the direction.
They say that The Heralds appear in response to someone's intent to kill.
They're able to stop time
to give him complete freedom from the speed of the flow of time
then Sagawa will land in the future he wishes for.
Have you ever thought about that before?
He just wants to go see the future?
if we told him we'd forgive him for what happened today,
Hey.
Stay back! Stop!
It was me.
It kind of felt like something I've never felt before.
Here we go. Climb up over there!
What's wrong? Hurry up.
I saw on the side of your face What looked to be love
Takafumi plans to use Makoto's newly awakened power to clear his name.
The next episode, "The Tenth Moment."
Okay, got it.
That was a good night's sleep.
Don't worry about it.
I'll help myself.
New Message To: Yui Was it a dream? Was it real? What do you think?
Morning!
Probably because you can't even feel the seasons change.
S-Sure...
For example, take me,
that there was such a thing.
You bet!
What's your next topic, Nagase?
what's missing from the StuCS paper,
I'll write the article.
Over my dead body!
Wouldn't this be right up your alley?
I don't think boys in high school are looking for that.
Wait, they might prefer a little maturity.
Then let's ask one of those boys in high school.
Since I'm representing every boy in high school,
Of course.
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Like you see in manga!
Yeah.
That had to be a nightmare!
Right. There, there.
Iori-chan was trying to be considerate, I guess?
Well, why don't we have tea now?
Yeah, you're...
No way...
Want me to help?
I'll be fine.
Anyway, you need to give me a good reason
You're in my body right now, so don't do anything weird!
when all of a sudden, I was back in the club room.
He's pretty good looking,
so he'd be popular with the girls if he laughed more often.
Why you...
I'm positive that Taichi and Iori-chan have switched places.
Still, shouldn't you be a little more skeptical?
You guys aren't fooling around or anything like that?
Big Jugged High School Gi
And I also got to hear Iori-chan talk dirty in the process!
Wait, did I just get hosed?
Is that true?!
I guess it's true.
What's wrong?
Was this really a one day thing?
Isn't that obvious?
Now look here, Inaba.
so I let the students call me Mr. Go,
So why are we here again?
Oh, right.
What's wrong, Yui?
Again?!
i1Hello?i0
Yaegashi...
Huh?
You look tired.
Taichi!
I was just trying to find a place to hide!
Let's focus on Fujishima-san!
Goto?
I just got here.
What does a little-known plant have to do with anything?
The five of you will randomly swap personalities for the time being.
And I'll be observing you.
I guess.
Don't worry too much about this and go on with your lives.
about the personality swap.
I have more questions for you!
That's not the task you've been assigned.
Kiriyama!
What's up with this whole "shocking turn of events" deal?
i1Huh?i0
we may be doing exactly what he wants.
we'll need to stay in contact and
urge to go while in Taichi or Aoki's body, that means...
I've learned how to pee while standing up.
Sorry.
but I moved away because you're Aoki right now.
I screwed up.
Nagase seemed different somehow.
Oh, Inaba-san.
Yaegashi-kun, do you have a moment?
Or something more?
Stay away from her!
Go!
You can't use your hands, right?
Okay!
Nagase Iori. Six years old.
What about the guy over here who's pretty handsome.
Taichi-oniichan!
Y-You're actually going to compliment me, Inaba-san?
They don't understand their current situation,
so they don't question why they're here.
It has to be.
It looks like he's reversing time this time.
It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen.
Mom's home.
Mihashi Chinatsu-san.
Mihashi-san and I faced each other in tournaments a lot.
And I quit karate.
in the lovable nature only a child can have!
I feel bad now.
Here you go.
Kiriyama Yui?
That's why you haven't kissed anyone before!
I'd say by the fall of your first year of high school...
Wait, that doesn't matter right now!
So the words on the board were meant as a hint.
Does that mean Taichi is the only one who won't have his time reversed?
Wh-What?
after you quit karate.
Uh, we're headed to the same place,
Taichi, can I ask you for a favor?
Aoki Yoshifumi! Eleven years old!
No need to be shy.
B-Big brother?!
T-Taichi and I look like a real couple?
I never thought I'd get to carry Iori like this.
A lot of things are different this time around.
Kiriyama's sister and a friend
so after I talked to Mihashi-san, we decided to follow you.
You're not getting away.
Then the person holding the baby was the mother?
Wh-Why do I need to have a purpose?
Why are you attacking me?!
you pale in comparison to your former self!
Mihashi-san, have you ever defeated me before?
Kiriyama was soundly beaten.
and New Year's Day together.
What's wrong, Yui?
Tried to...
It's okay.
I need to get some fresh air.
Stop cowering like a wimp.
but she can be pretty hostile.
Are you okay, Yui?
Shut up!
but Yui, you should talk things out with Mihashi-san.
But you should hear her out.
There's nothing wrong with me!
I'm like a background character now.
I rely on everyone else to help me.
And I can't do anything in return.
That was the decision I made back then.
Hmm?
I was pretty close to her, so it was a shock.
It made me realize that humans can die at any time.
So that's the path you've chosen?
I really loved you.
Why are you in such a hurry?!
That's why I usually don't think things through.
I truly loved Nana.
because I was living life to the fullest.
But that's because I look like Nishino-san.
It wasn't your appearance.
I fell in love with you as a person... that's the only way I can put it.
I could have explained that I was scared of men, and worked something out!
I was the one who refused to take the last step!
lose again.
The phrase "I am my own Lord throughout heaven and earth" is perfect for me.
that phrase means that you're the best,
A-Anyway, I'm...
Well, it might be hard now,
It was a mistake to choose you.
No matter, since this is goodbye.
Why? It's not five yet.
Right, hold on!
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!
And you have really good balance.
Iori-chan, are you cold?
You know how your memories of the time you returned to
Aoki and Yui really impressed me back there.
I felt the same way for a while.
She sounds like she's about to ask the police to search for me.
How long has it been?
Ah, that's why I...
I remember now.
Huh? Why?
But I have to go!
What do you see?
I always thought I needed to do this myself
Yui...
Open up! It's Iori!
we might make things worse.
Well, it appears that you're in some trouble.
But there's something else to take care of first.
Whoa!
Heartseed?
and Number Two are acting separately?
We should probably hurry back.
Oh, I have a proposal for Nagase-san.
What?
I don't have time to listen to you.
I am who I am now because of
I'm done.
Yes, he shouldn't be back for a while.
Huh? Oh...
Mom, do you love him? Are you happy?
You weren't wrong.
No, because I just wanted Mom to be happy.
And I was prepared to endure it as long as my daughter was happy.
Really?
He's back!
This is my responsibility.
What the hell are you saying?!
You can't
Never show your face here again!
And just like that, winter vacation was over,
I honestly think that StuCS is something special.
Looks like you're going to get a second chance!
My name's Purupura.
I've been charged with being your guide.
Makoto comes from a four person family.
Ah...ah!
Nothing wrong, right?
This is my mother.
And...
You could've carried his luggage to the washroom.
Yeah, but... I'm kinda full.
Oh yeah... There was that time we had the buffet at that hotel...
Not something Makoto would say, evidently.
You should go to your room and have a rest.
...which one, exactly?
N...nothing...
You didn't tell me anything about Makoto.
...that I spent the whole time sleeping!
You're...
How terribly naive...
Ah...
What...? If you had that, why didn't you pull it out sooner?
He gets all the worst tasks stuck on him, and does tons of overtime.
But he's still never considered for promotion.
Oh, what about his grandmother?
In the trail of misfortune that is Makoto's life, that was the worst day of all!
You're having fun, huh?
Are you sure you're an angel and not...?
Hmm...
What is it? Do you want jam or something?
On October 10th, on his way home from cram school...
Can't blame him for getting quite a shock.
Ahahaha...
You're my guide, aren't you? Don't you have any advice for me?
If my heart was made of glass, it was broken to pieces years ago.
But could you maybe tell me when you're heading out in fu...
Hey, I hope you're paying attention to where we're going.
A lackey?
And it's not like I came back to Earth by choice.
I thought he died.
Hello.
Makoto!
Eep...
U...um...
U...um...I think this just comes down to individual interpretation, so...
I just...think you were better before.
Makoto, Mr. Sawada was really surprised with you today.
I was really happy to hear it.
You're a third year now.
Huh? Oh, you mean me trying to kill myself?
Nice justification.
To escape from the boredom at home.
Shouko's nagging got on my nerves, but...
Ah, your brother's in a hurry so he's already started eating.
I figured you always liked ketchup, so...
He told me I should talk to you about your choice of high school.
Hey!
Can't a sinful soul get a little privacy...?
...so that you can have a chance to live again.
...something REALLY bad, right?
I might've ripped off a bunch of people and made off with a ton of cash.
I feel kinda calm just sitting in front of it.
Huh? But you're the one who painted it.
N...no, there's definitely something weird...
A...stupid face? Uh...
That's awesome, Makoto.
Your brother's decided to change his first choice to medicine.
- Yo! - Huh?
N...no, it's fine.
Ah!
- No way! - Hey, no fair!
Just one of my fans.
...and when we met he didn't seem so bad.
I want it now!
Forget it.
I had fun running in the rain with you there.
Wait, I'll get you a towel!
I...it's just that...
Hmm...
Are you hungry? I can make you some rice porridge.
Can I come in?
Think I should be back in school next week.
I see...good...
So what if I do?
Umm...not that that's a bad thing...
So...if she's the reason you've c...changed...
Did he do something horrible?
So you disappear for all that time...
What'll happen to Makoto?
Oh! Makoto!
Yep. Lost it somewhere.
Huh?
What I find most interesting is...
It's kind of exciting, isn't it?
Table tennis, huh?
Thanks to all that practice, I ended up with the 31st lowest grades in a class of 32.
You're kidding me?
Ahaha...
In a way, we're kind of awesome, huh?
It's pretty nice.
Or so I'd like to say.
It's just your regular park, huh? They could've put up some kind of memorial.
You think someone from the Joumon Era would burst into tears 'cause they lost a pair of trainers?
A stylish, designer Haniwa.
But by the time you get there, it'll already be...
They said if you didn't like the colour, you could change it.
Can you draw me next?
I don't draw people.
I ended up eating most of his as well as mine.
Y...yes...
How'd you recognise her?
Well...
I'm screwed up... I've completely lost it...
We're all beautiful screwups.
It's a unique school that values individuality...
So you're saying it's my fault?
He was all for you going there.
No problem.
Your brother has been worried sick about you too, you know.
And the time you were attacked...
You used to play there together as kids, right?
Like you're one to talk.
Even though a certain someone doesn't even eat them.
Stop it, Mitsuru.
...I want to go to the same school as him.
I want to make lots more friends...
Want a dash?
Meet me on the roof of the school after class tomorrow.
Sure thing.
You didn't hear from Saotome?
I used to get told to die or fuck off... People would write about me on the net...
Right?
Yeah...
No. Not at all...
Shut your mouth!
Close your damn eyes!
I'll be checking up on you every now and then.
You sure are.
Hey, don't gimme that!
Oh, I forgot the sugar.
What, are you blind?
Wow, scary.
Unlike you, I don't watch wrestling all night.
Morning, Inaban!
What, you two come to school together?
Or, for example,
Or, for example,
q3Nagase Iori, who thought that, with so many clubs, choosing one would be a hassle
Or, for example,
and ended up having to search for another club.
Oh?
or CRC.
I made no reference to the content of your article,
120 yen per peek.
Then let's ask a high school boy.
"Both of you strip!"
It happened to Yui too!
Why don't we have some tea for now?
Are these...
q3Don't you think it's better if someone else does it for you?
Girls would be all over him if he always smiled like this.
I guess I have to accept it.
But don't you all think you're accepting it way too easily?
Yeah. Ask me anything you want.
What kind of question is that?!
Um...
It certainly was, Captain Inaba!
Wait! Inaban, are you serious?!
30 or 40 minutes, I guess.
Was it just something that happened to you four?
Onii-chan!
Yeah. I had a meeting that ran really late.
Onii-chan, stop treating me like such a kid!
Why is your name some obscure plant's?
I'm Aoki Yoshifumi!
It's like we're some secret society. It's exciting!
Meanwhile, I'll be eating.
but talking down to me is kind of...
Inaban's just amazing!
I've been tainted!
q2When you were in my body earlier, you went to the girls' bathroom.
Who cares about that? Taichi, how big are Iori-chan's b
I just got here.
who are you?
In other words, you're something else in Gossan's body?
I guess.
And well, I want to watch you switch personalities
just live your lives the way you normally would.
I'm hoping for the best from around the top of my heart.
q2You better not think that everything will go exactly the way you want!
I was here, trying to get through this paperwork...
Dammit!
Just how careless can you people be?
Let's start with the most basic problem.
Um... can I make a suggestion?
No! No! No! Zettai yada, yada, yada!
but you're perfectly safe.
Totally sure!
Oh, that?
Right!
I'm back in my own body!
What're you talking about?
Okay.
I'll make it up to you later, so please forgive me, Inaba-san.
Well, let's see.
What?
Just win Iori over before Fujishima beats you to the punch.
What do you mean by "selfless freak"?
If no one wants to do it, then I have to take it on myself.
q0My favorite wrestlers are the ones called "jobbers," who dedicate themselves to getting beaten
q0but if there's anyone who comes off worse every time, it's her.
Sorry.
Will you forgive me?
Y-You know,
I'm sorry to bring this up all of a sudden,
Um...
Time to delete.
So, if you don't mind, will you go out with me?
Wait, Inaba, what are you doing?
Inaba-san, if I die socially, I don't think I can go on living normally!
Yes, ma'am!
I'm definitely stronger than both of you, you know?
I...
And I didn't even notice when I was in Kiriyama's body.
That's not me at all!
I get the feeling you're more amazing than you look.
That's it!
But if that happens...
Okay.
but don't let it bother you.
it took all I had just to get away.
Then let me help you!
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.From preview
Kiriyama, I think this is far enough.
Oh, right.
You've got the wrong guy.
I might be wrong, after all.
Of course! Anytime!
What do you think that meant?
Inaba?
Inaba?!
Like I'd die from standing up too fast.
Balloon Vine didn't do anything.
You have to take care of your own body.
Right?
I just might faint out of shock.
It's almost like you can't trust us.
Right, Inaban?
but I had no idea she was so afraid of them.
And you know, Yui might be falling for Taichi too.
The problem with selfless freaks is that everyone starts falling for them.
I'll... keep that in mind.
But it's times like these when I can't think of a joke!
Why hope for something like that?!
I have five dads.
You mean your mom divorced and remarried that many times?
I've been pretending to be different "me's" ever since.
After he died, my mom cried and said, "I'm so sorry I never thought about what you wanted.
I'll do everything I can so we can live the way you want from now on."
To live the way I want...
I don't know how to do that.
But
I won't let that happen!
How can you be so sure?
"Darker"?
Wait.
Forget I did.
You said something like that before.
You guys are...
I can't trust any of you.
And more than anything else,
Inaba, we wouldn't hate you just because
Taichi,
By "masturbate," do you mean that...
Actually, I rarely do it at all.
And more than anything, actually feeling moved by it is stupid.
I check my body whenever I switch with Aoki.
What about Taichi?
Nope.
Nagase!
So,
Well, what you do next is up to you.
what did you think about Aoki and Yui at lunch?
What's perfect about it?
I don't know!
Nagase!
This was definitely all my fault, anyway.
I'm really sorry.
But were you really just pretending?
They're all you.
I'd say that it's totally normal.
But I change mine depending on who
Nagase.
Sorry.
But the fault lies with all of you.
He'll be here soon.
Are you saying you can control people's lives?
For the next 30 minutes, I'll make it so that
You...
The doctors are doing everything they can too!
It's better if I get hurt instead!
I can put up with it!
I'm not doing it for anyone else.
I think that Iori-chan has to die with her body.
What are you saying?!
but someone had to.
Either way, we need to tell Iori-chan.
Killing another personality and taking their body is a sin.
If I cried, you couldn't cry yourself.
We were very lucky.
We'll let you see her soon.
She's alive?
Thank goodness.
Well, you could say it was planned from start to finish.
You didn't plan on hurting Nagase at all from the start?
I kind of feel bad, though.
Looks like you took my first kiss.
Well, you can't really complain if it's not their fault.
Does your back itch or something?Lol. This fucking guy.
I-Inaba
Yui?
What's gotten into you?
What happened?
What's wrong? Did it hurt?
Why are you asking me?
Hello? Nagase?
Good... evening?
This is kind of weird.
I'm... feeling it, too.
Sorry to bother you like this. Bye!Dat "Bye!" hnnng
You were acting so weird a few weeks ago.
Huh?
I'll think about it.
i1Again?i0
So tell us, Fujishima-san!
Well, they were just trying to help out their fellow schoolmates.
They'll probably just let them off with a stern warning.
Isn't she...
You could say that I'm helping you find your true selves.
That's all I can say.
You'll make it interesting?
q3Your desires get unleashed, and you just can't help yourself.
but I know I wasn't going to cross any lines!
Yui and Aoki have already caused trouble for other people.
or we can do the opposite and keep stress from building
We're counting on you, Taichi.
What should I do?
We're really dangerous, no matter how you look at it.
The desires in our hearts are going to be unleashed.
I hate myself for thinking things like that,
I'll treat you to a snack or something tomorrow.
I'll make it work out.
I have to do it right.
I never thought you'd turn your back on a friend.
If you work hard enough,
Aren't you in love with Iori?
to make sure that no one else would have to suffer.
Which confirms that you're a selfless freak.
In pro wrestling, it's not about who can
Sounds like a job for the selfless freak, right?
I should probably mention that Iori's in love with you.
Are you an idiot?!
At any moment, any one of us could be seriously hurt, completely broken!
Y-Yeah...
Wait, Inaba!
Inaba-san! If you kill my chances at a normal life,
Every time I'm Yui,
Why should I be scared of a couple weaklings...
I'll go help her calm down.
Yeah...
Don't be too hard on yourself.
But in retrospect, there were signs.
now that I've hurt Yui.
Yeah, is this Kiriyama?
so your sister was a little freaked out.
Anyway...
Still, this was back when I practiced karate every day.
That's because I was desperate.
Why should a girl have to experience the pain of a man?
You even hurt yourself in the process.
Sounds like something you would say.
Were you the person I saw struggling
Hey, Kiriyama...
Hey, hey, hey.
Not right now. Not right now.
In that case, let's have a strategy meeting, Iori-chan!
I just gave Kiriyama a little push.
can actually do some good.
Twin Feelings
Yui, you're still not up?
You know, the one in your club.
You mean Nagase?
Why are you late?
I think my desires got
Maybe if you weren't so retarded.
I've never gotten violent without a reason.
i1Onii-chan!i0
Just curious, but was Nagase hit by a desire for sleep, too?
You could act a little more surprised!
Yeah. As long as it's something like shouting "Yahoo!"
we can look back on it and laugh.
I have to save her!
I have to save Kiriyama!
Just how badly do you want to save people?
Well, I don't mind giving it a try, but...
Iori-chan! Do it for Taichi! Please!
Is there a problem?
Don't look at me with those lewd eyes of yours.
You really might be the one in the most danger this time.
She said that she was okay when I called her last night...
We definitely have to visit Yui today.
If we go there looking like that,
Wait, Iori?
What're you...
Come on, Yui. Open the door.
No! No! No! Don't look!
Of course I wouldn't do that!
I can't go outside like this!
Hey, Inaba...
I'm sorry, Setouchi-san.
Is that why you didn't do anything when Nagase yelled?
Well, you couldn't help yourself.
I...
Inaba should come back if we give her some time.
Even if we went to her room, what would we do then?
But if one of our desires gets unleashed while we're there,
it'll turn out the same as last time.
But Kiriyama looked so sad that she could die!
overlapI want to save her, but I don't know what to do!
TaichiThen we should go see Kiriyama first!
Aoki, calm down!
I've had enough of this.
Aoki, calm down!
I said to stop it, you two!
I said too much. Sorry.
Did you get into a fight with your girlfriend?
So you're seeing him again tonight?
Yeah, I'll be fine by myself.
You're going to the club room, right?
Hey.
Kiriyama from Class 1-1.
I don't mean to pry,
but did someone screw something up?
Other classes will also be using the facilities.
With fewer members per group, helping each other becomes a necessity.
For now, form groups with two to three boys or girls in each.
That's how I like it!
You don't have a right to tell me what to do.
Okay?
Then it's settled.
I'll be in the club room.
Don't mention it. It's not like I had anything else to do.
I know.
Inaba?
Right?
He's got a lot on his plate right now.
But if you didn't talk to them, you couldn't do something.
But then you might hurt them
If you sit down and decide what's most important to you,
Sorry.
but there's more to this world than just the five of us.
Is that place really the most important thing to you?
Hey.
But... the text you sent... said that you wanted to talk.
But after distancing myself from you all, I realized that I really want to be with everyone.
even if there are better ways for you to go about it.
This is a different kind of "hurt," though.
Listen, Aoki.
I said something really mean the other day.
I'm really sorry.
Like a knife through the chest.
I was jealous of you because you saved Yui and everyone else, while I couldn't do anything.
And when all is said and done, I saved them for my own selfish reasons.
She hasn't called yet, so...
Let's sit down for a bit.
We can't let her stay in her room forever.
If we're really careful and don't back down...
Yui, it's me and Taichi.
I know you won't!
That's how it works, right?
What?
Well, if you can prove that I won't do it, then...
Don't you call it baseless, too!
Anyway, I've been wondering.
I thought so.
But you know exactly what it means now.
q3Actually, I injured Nagase when my desires got unleashed the other day.
q3But it's nothing more than speculation right now. We don't have any actual proof.
Score!
It would be my honor.
Hey, you okay?
Looks like I got worried for nothing.
Wait, hold on, Nagase!
Get a different one!
I guess it's a good thing it happened now. It's just
Not trusting anyone.
I thought you'd only interfere if we shut ourselves in.
I just came here to shake things up.
Why do you feel so troubled?
Why is that place so important to you?
Or at least I hoped you would.
Oh?
No need to worry.
Don't shut yourself in any more now.
Next Episode Title: What It Means to Say It
Watase-kun, could you think of something for us?
D-Do I have to do it, too?
We're done washing the rice.
Why?!
I'm listening!
Um...
There's rice on your cheek.
I'd go on a field trip every day for this!
I wonder where those two went.
Why?
You're going to tell me why right now, Inaba Himeko!
Because... when it comes to guys and girls...
You think I'd know that?
I didn't have a choice!
I can't help it!
I've always wanted someone to tell me that.
So I can't go back to the club room.
q3I know you're trying to do everything you can to keep the five of us together,
the friendship between Nagase Iori and Inaba Himeko won't end over one lousy guy!
Okay, I got it.
You were really emotional just now.
But there was a little accident.
I don't know what I did, but I'm sorry!
I finally made it back.
I don't know where I was, either.
What do you mean?
Shoot!
Himeko, what happened? You never say anything when you leave.
Ow, ow, ow!
Taichi.
Oh, sorry! We have to go now!
Where are we going?
we were able to live our lives in peace.
When I open them, everything will be normal again.
Kiriyama Yui! I'm eleven!
Nope.
And there we have it.
Yeah.
They're back!
For me, it's what I was like back in fifth grade.
I was so bright and breezy.
What if we turn into kids in front of our families?
If it only happens between those times,
Don't tell me you didn't give her a present.
but you're not him.
No way! Why'd you quit?
A friend from back when I practiced karate.
Wait, Kiriyama...
A rival?
She said something about a promise?
Yeah.
But I don't remember.
Now that he's got Inaba? What?
Hey, this place is pretty nice.
She's too cute!
Now she's totally afraid of you.
Then what about hers?
She isn't Nishino Nana's big sister?
Oh, right. You look just like her...
You can already write your own name!
You can see Inaba's brilliant mind already taking shape!
This is grown-up talk!
Huh?
What am I supposed to do?
Why am I naked?!
Hey, whose is this? Can I drink it?
She was a girl who lived near me. We're the same age.
I thought you would say something like,
You haven't had a time regression yet, so you don't know,
It's confusing the heck out of me.
Oh, right. I ran into Mihashi-san today.
Did I say something bad?
Taichi and me look like boyfriend and girlfriend?
What should I get?
Then why don't we get something that everyone can enjoy?
i1Is this the real fourteen-year-old Nagase Iori?
One day, it might be the trigger for something that ruins us all.
milk.
Nothing's happening to Taichi, and Balloon Vine still hasn't appeared.
You're not going anywhere.
Huh?
But if you're the father...
same timeIt's not a love triangle!
So you're just goofing off?
Who are you to judge me?!
I told you...
Fight me!
Hey, stop, Iori!
Cheer up, Nana's sister!
She said she got a fun new game
I'm Kiriyama Yui!
Sorry.
Why do I keep thinking that she's Nana's sister?!
Don't let it get to you.
We ended up spending New Year's Eve and New Year's Day together.
I...
Huh?
I just wanted
Sorry it has to be me again.
I gave up on my dreams and left it all behind me.
Yeah.
I don't want to stick my nose in other people's love lives.
forgot to be laid-back!
It doesn't look like you'll be getting your time regressed.
Y-Yeah. Got it.
That's your philosophy?
Right. I don't know if it's right or wrong.
But I'll need to live it to the fullest to know.
Sorry, I just had to see you.
Huh?
That's okay. Thanks for coming to see me.
Oh, and my hair...
All right! It's about time we left.
Yui.
because I was living life to the fullest.
What's wrong with that?
Nana is Nana.
Because I love you, Yui.
I knew all along!
Thanks.
but it doesn't.
Yoshifumi-kun, how old are you?
Listen, I might not be able to right now,
How do you know that?gj Taichi
What are you hiding from us?
Mom!
I...
The Second?
Clothes! My clothes!
I'm hungry!
So this is how it feels to have your time regressed.
This is happening because Taichi told us about The Second, right?
Right.
I'll bear with it.
Not good.
Hello, Mom?
Mom!
He helped out around the house for a while after coming back, but lately...
He doesn't harm us physically, but...
it's my problem.
Why do you have to protect her?
I...
You kept it all to yourself and now it's come to this.
But...
Shouldn't we take the train or the bus?
Dammit!
What if we go in there and make things worse?
This marks the end of this phenomenon.
But there's no way to...
I am who I am now because of my past.
No.
Then why are you letting him stay here?
Excuse me,
All I cared about was if my mom was happy.
I didn't mind putting up with him if it meant my daughter was happy.
It'll be six on one. We'll be fine, won't we?
Hurry it up!Should this be on the top of the screen?
I can't
but I am who I am now because he was there.
Oh, sure, Yui!hnnnng
but we put our heads together and got through it.
Especially Taichi.
Sorry, Iori.
I overslept again.
Did you burn yourself?
Oh? Yui! Aoki! Morning!
But while most wolves hunt in packs, no matter where you go, there will always be lone wolves.
Or, for example,
Aoki Yoshifumi, who sincerely believed that
Oh?
Just Taichi and Inaban?
Darn. I sprinted up the stairs for just you two?
I'm here too.
You're charging for it?
q3No one's looking for that sort of excitement from our newspaper.
Inaban, did you get that?
Right?
But before I knew it, I was back to normal.
a girl's... a woman's...
"Nagase-san"?
Taichi!
Fujishima-san, if you needed TaichiI mean, meI mean, Nagase Iori, then I'm sorry.
Let go of me, Fujishima!
What kind of joke is this supposed to be?
Shut up!
and was going to punish him physically for it as usual,
you two keep putting on this stupid act!
q3Well, if it happened to you, all you could say is "Oh, that's what happened!"
would you mind if I whispered it into Aoki's ear?
I hope I never get on Inaba's bad side...
You can't be serious...
Was it just a one-day phenomenon?
Thanks.
What's up? You seem angrier than usual.
Nothing. This is how I always am.
Mom?
Sounds like a rough day.
I'm in fifth grade now!
Why do I have to be in this totally uncute body?
You guys don't cause much trouble,
Man, the first bite of hot food always goes down the wrong way.
What were we talking about again?
Some mini chocolate buns we shared yesterday had gone bad, so we all came in late with upset stomachs.
That's all.
You can go now.
Yeah. I don't know how she can lie through her teeth with such confidence.
If you can't say anything nice, just shut up.
So?
Anyone home?
Yeah. Is Kiriyama there?
Where are you?
...bathroom.
It's okay.
Yaegashi.
Bathrooms again?
You touched my boobs!
I was just trying to find a place to hide!
Wait, that's not important right now!
q0Perfect manners, perfect grades, and the teachers all love her.
I'm sorry about your boobs,
Oh, and could you not call me Gossan or Gotou?
Then...
who are you?
Well, I'm something like an observer for you five.
q0Then you have something to do with us switching personalities.
That would require effort.
That was hardly an explanation.
That's not what you need to do.
q2You better not think that everything will go exactly the way you want!
Huh? I haven't gotten anywhere.
We don't know how much of what he said was true,
q0If you run into someone, act like the person you switched with.
How could you do that?!
Could we try going to the bathroom more often when we're not switched?
q0But if one of us girls switches with Taichi or Aoki and has to go to the bathroom,
Okay. Aoki and I will make sure we do that.
More importantly, what about our purity?
Are our bodies safe?
I haven't had to go to the bathroom yet, either.
I was thinking that it might be dangerous to leave a girl at home alone.
But if someone were to break in,
Once it happens, it's too late!
I'm... sorry.
It's just that you're in Aoki's body right now, so I jumped back.
q0This is why we identify a person by their own physical body.
Oh, it's nothing.
I'll be frank.
What do you think you're doing, Inaba?
Why do you like professional wrestling?
But you asked!
I've never seen anyone so close to breaking down.
This personality switching can ruin any of us at any time,
How can you be so calm about this?
Will you forgive me?
Um...
I love you!
So, if you don't mind, will you go out with me?
q0But when I see her making such a girly confession... My heart!
Let's do some more before Yui and Inaba-chan get back!
I've always...
Listen up. If you do it again, you're dead.
O-Okay.
Yeah, but she said that she had something to do, then left.
Yui, are you scared of us two or something?
would ever be...
I'm sick of my own stupidity.
I think that's all that's important,
You jump right to saving her!
Didn't you like this duo?
Over and over.
If so, would you mind telling me?
Did you know?
Hey, Kiriyama.
What's wrong with that?
For me...
You don't like it either!
Never mind me. Just go.
This isn't the time for cool movie lines!
Oh no!
Kiriyama, I think this is far enough.
Yeah.
I'll practice more at home.
If so, sorry for suspecting you.
Morning, Taichi!
You know, Taichi...
Of course! Anytime!
Maybe later.
What do you think that meant?
So?
I guess good things can come from this personality switching too.
All I could see was disaster...
Are you actually scolding me?
I don't need four people escorting me around.
I think I'm gonna faint from the shock.
Nagase, I'm pretty sure that Kiriyama
I understand.
Inaban, you should be worried more about
Oh, that's right.
I almost forgot.
Inaban decides everything on her own.
to say something funny before the mood gets serious.
All the more reason to not do it.
The joke was that I couldn't come up
with a joke when I needed one.
I learned to adopt a persona.
This was back when I was in first grade, I think.
But the real hell starts after that.
That's because...
A-Anyway, I'll be able to recognize you.
You swore that I could spill my guts and nothing would change!
I'm not going to leave you all alone while you're sick.
Keep it down.
Why do you want to help me?
Why couldn't you be a little darker?
If two people switch bodies,
Well, it may be unfair to say you'd commit a crime.
In that sense,
you're probably doomed to be a selfless freak forever.
Are you saying that it would be stupid to worry about that?
I-I can't do it.
This is all so stupid.
What's wrong with you?
What about Taichi?!
It's not just me, right?
Sure. Whatever.
The same as I always have?
Inaban! Can you stop analyzing us like that?
"hi-ho, the derry-o" or something!
And you know, Yui might be falling for Taichi too.
So do it.
But it's times like these when I can't think of a joke!
Why hope for something like that?!
I even changed my tastes to match his.
M-Morning, Nagase.
Taichi!
Iori, go back to class.
We're back?
You can go back to class now.
If there's a reason, tell me.
Why do you want to help me?
Inaba, are you sure you're okay?
When I said "I'm not okay," I meant
Inaba...
No!
the responsibility falls on the body's original owner.
I always imagine that you might do things like that.
q0I suppose you can't save someone who doesn't have any trauma.
So why not tell them?
I'd probably die socially.
Then why don't you tell me this "secret" of yours.
But that part of you is fine by me.
Confessing that you did something like that is stupid.
And thinking that you'd come out fine after telling me is stupid.
Dammit, what is wrong with you?
It's not just me?
Break's going to be over soon.
Then we'll be in the same boat.I like the Cold War: Then we'll have mutually assured destruction.
I know that you're thinking I really don't need to,
And you can always change y
Not yet.
I don't have time for that kind of talk!
i1Nagase!
q2But that's because you wanted to try moving on, right?
Being happy, being angry, being sad...
That's why I wish I could be more like you and show that I'm enjoying my life.
They're all Nagase Iori!
I'd say that it's totally normal.
You have a lot.
I wish I could be more like you too.
Well, I'll apologize ahead of time.
Where's Gossan?
What the hell?!
Yeah. He could've been lying,
it just gets worse and worse!
Nagase, it doesn't have to be that way!
One too heavy for me to live with.
Taichi...
Not really, but I thought you might tell one.
But you're sadder than me.
I had so much to look forward to.
You even told me that you love me.
Me. Nagase Iori will die with Nagase Iori's body.
Of course.
There shouldn't be any permanent damage.
That's how the story goes.
I even made sure her cell phone didn't get wet.
After all, this experience was to your benefit.
q3and now we're busy making up for lost time on the next issue of the CRC News.
At least, we thought so...
Hey!
I-Inaba
Blood?
Hey, every
What happened to them?
Hello? Nagase?
But I get it now. You're lovesick.
U-Um...
Fujishima?
Let's see.
Well, they were just trying to help out their fellow schoolmates.
Yui's afraid of men.
I wonder.
Unleashing our desires?
Sorry to make you worry about me.
I'm totally okay, but...
Um...
Now look what you've done!
Before you came in two days ago, my desires got unleashed,
Oh? When I wasn't here?
We can talk more about it then.
Yeah! I know it!
Take care of Iori.
We didn't really get to finish last time.
but I want to keep our distance right now.
You're right.
We're probably really dangerous right now.
We're really dangerous, no matter how you look at it.
We don't know what we might do.
That's another part of who you are.
I have to do it right.
Sorry I'm that kind of person.
I've never gotten violent without a reason.
So what desire got unleashed?
Shut it, siscon!www
The general reaction was pretty much, "Sounds like something Iori'd do."
i1Yui...i0
our unleashed desires won't be crazy either.
It was just you being a selfless freak and trying to save someone again.
But isn't whatever incites our desires being unleashed usually right in front of us?
Wait. My eyes don't always look lewd, do they?
You really might be the one in the most danger this time.
What do you mean?
Who knows what'll happen if a desire like that got unleashed.
You're all here?
I'll go back to school soon.
I'll let you in, so please, stop!
If not, we can go home now.
I made a huge mistake!
You aren't staying home from school because of that zit, are you?
When those boys started to get rough with those girls,
I just can't deal with men.
He'll make someone jump off a bridge again, or maybe something even worse!
Inaban!
Sorry, Yui.
But that's what you really thought, right?
You don't have to yell at me!
No, that's not...
Stop right there.
she ran out of patience.
Isn't that right, Nagase-san?
Inaba.
Later.
Not really.
Don't give up like that!
There are times when my hands are full.
Right!
I'm sure Inaba-chan knows that it's not really your fault, too.
This is hard on you, too, but I still...
You only said it because you were worried about Yui.
I...
It's like we're losing everybody, one by one.
Didn't we say the same things yesterday?
I don't think anything good can come from our current situation.
But Yui will just get hurt if she goes outside.
Who knows what she might do to the people around her?
How many times are we going to do this?!
You too, Taichi!
What'd you call me?
Is either of you really thinking about Yui?
Asleep?
Good night.
Taichi!
You're going to the club room, right?
Sorry, not going today, either.
Sure, you could just spend it playing around with your friends.
So what will it be?
The six groups of five? Or do you still want bigger groups?
I haven't had any good moments.
And I think Fujishima might be too much for you to handle.
I want you and Nagase-san to get along.
Me?!
That's not in my job description as a teacher.
Hey.
Was it Nagase?
Isn't hurting and causing problems for each other what being friends is all about?
Not hurting them? Or talking and accomplishing something?
By the way,
But what you think about that is up to you.
Sorry.
Let me know if you ever need any help again.
What are you, Fujishima?
Talking man-to-man in a place like this is like youth at full throttle!
ED
q3That's why I tried to put some distance between us. I didn't want to hurt anyone.
Will that really work?
q3Are you going to tell everyone else something similar to what you just told me
So I'm sorry I pushed you
This is a different kind of "hurt," though.
It feels like we haven't talked in ages.
Listen, Aoki.
Taichi,
Don't lie to me!
I know you won't!
Let's go to a love hotel.
q3And just for good measure, you should wear something erotic.
Don't you call it baseless, too!
But that's not really being violent.
But you know exactly what it means now.
Good job, Taichi.
Worried sick!
q3It was just supposed to be what we needed for the week,
Wait, hold on, Nagase!
Get a different one!
All three of you?
You shouldn't hold it against yourself.
Come back to the club room! We're all waiting for you!
You could call it that.
Judging from your current mental state,
Or at least I hoped you would.
Is that place really the most important thing to you?
How'd you like a fist to the face?
Are you going to do this to the others, too?
Don't you think something like this can be interesting as well?
Let's go.
Inaba!
I got the worst luck in this morning's horoscope on TV.
Whoa.
No reason. It feels like it's been a while since we talked like this.
I mean, it looks like Inaba-chan is almost back to normal.
Why?!
Okay, it's time.
I can take care of myself!
Oh, shut up. I brought my own.
Just mind your own business...
Inaban!
Inaban!
I mean, I knew you loved Taichi, too...
Because...
You were looking for someone who would support you,
and that's like second nature to Taichi.
q3If you and Taichi got together, everything would be just peachy!
But then I got to high school, and I finally met people I could call my friends.
You're wrong.
But it's too late now.
Because everything would be way too awkward.
I just can't.
q3I know you're trying to do everything you can to keep the five of us together,
the friendship between Nagase Iori and Inaba Himeko won't end over one lousy guy!
You were really emotional just now.
Yaegashi-san fell.
Wasn't Nagase-san with you?
He tried to help a kitten that got stuck in a tree.
And then he fell from there.
I apologize!
What's important is that we're free right now. Let's enjoy it!
Hey, Inaba.
I mean, you're not going out with Iori yet.
Himeko, what happened? You never say anything when you leave.
Inaba? Did you find him?
Where'd he go?
Not really. I can let go...
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, yeah. That's what happened.
Oh, sorry! We have to go now!
Still not normal!
Okay!
Aoki Onii-chan.
Taichi-san.
And I get a compliment, Inaba-san?
Do you remember anything from when you turned into a kid?
Like playing with friends and going to school,
and stuff at home.
There's a building scheduled for demolition by my house.
Let's meet there tomorrow.
You can call me the Second.
So you're part of Balloon Vine's ilk,
but you're not him.
But don't tell anyone about me.
Yeah, back in the day.
Fire!
Sorry about that, Himeko-chan.
Orange.Because they spelled it that way?
missingHere you go.
Thanks, Nana's sister!
Nana?
Then what about hers?
You can see Inaba's brilliant mind already taking shape!
You're too young for this, Himeko-chan!
I mean, what happens to our clothes when we go back to normal?
Got it!
Maybe Taichi won't get time regressed?
Something like that.
Isn't that like...
Just on the spur of the moment.
Oh, right. I ran into Mihashi-san today.
Onee?
Then as thanks...
Taichi and me look like boyfriend and girlfriend?
Don't mention it!
So this time...
Preview
Hey, quit shaking.
q3A pure young maiden can't produce breast milk, you idiots!
You're not going anywhere.
Then the girl who was holding her was the mother?
I got Anzu to go home.
Seriously...
Don't get too far from me!hnnng
And so, the new year came.
Looks like her time regressed to right after she was assaulted.
Then can I read that book?
Are you all right, Yui?
Don't treat me like that!
I remembered.
I'm like some side character, aren't I?you're the worst girl, sorry
I'm completely worthless now.
I'm no one important.
Huh?
It doesn't look like you'll be getting your time regressed.
What just happened?! Why does Aoki suddenly look kind of cool?
Right. I don't know if it's right or wrong.
But I'll need to live it to the fullest to know.
Yeah, I brought her New Year's card with me.
Nana...
That's good.
Oh, and my hair...
Yui.
But I'm living life to the fullest even harder now.
I fell in love with you for who you are.
That's all I wanted to say.
When did I stop caring if I won or lost?
I won.
Okay.
It looks like everything worked out.
I...
They also said not to tell you anything.
My clothes!
Why?
Clothes! My clothes!
overlapOkay, okay! Just get down from there, okay?
This is happening because Taichi told us about The Second, right?
But my mom and sister are really mad at me right now.
Thank you very much for your consideration.
So that's how you saw me.
When your time regresses, your memories from back then are really clear, right?
Mom!
There have been times where I thought,
Dad...
Hold on
What should I do?!
What should I do?
If I do things right, Dad won't be mad.
How long has it been?
How old...
I won't cause you any trouble.
It's because you didn't tell anyone, didn't depend on anyone, and tried to do everything yourself.
But...
This is my home.
Mom!
What's going...
So you and The Second were acting separately?
Regardless, it's all over now.
Oh, I have a suggestion for you, Nagase-san.
I'll undo everything that's happened until now
Maybe I wouldn't have caused trouble for anyone.
I...
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't lived my past the way I did.
Should we call the police?
Shut up!
But you whispered "Thanks" to him, didn't you?
but I am who I am now because he was there.
About that...
I think I'm going to pick up karate again.
That's what I believe.
Taichi is a great guy.
He's a great guy, but...
Please go out with me.
Not yet...
And Inaba's really pretty.
Wh-What about me?
No way!
So...
And it's more awkward when you look like Nagase.
Why would you think that?
Nagase was pretending to have switched with you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Looks like you have some idea.
I don't have time to talk about that right now!
Move, Fujishi
Nobody will notice a change on the inside
do things spontaneously or plan everything out,
Um, what are you getting at?
In each case, you're still you.
What's that mean?
One person can't wear all of those masks!
You're always true to yourself.
Hello.
Nagase!
Hello there.
Bastard...
I want you to choose which personality
will die with Nagase-san's body.
That's a load of bull.
but you only care about yourself!
but somebody had to.
Iori, listen carefully.
Can I
Hey, Nagase.
I want to give a response now.
Not really, but I figured
Everyone else looked so sad.
I don't want to die.
Why?
What did I do wrong?
Right after you told me that you love me...
Huh?
Well, that would be the logical conclusion.
Oh, it's time.
It appears that there won't be any permanent damage.
It also serves as a get well gift for Nagase-san.
Well, I knew it was a possibility.
but I hope that you won't hold a grudge
Don't worry about that.
Sure. Have a seat, Iori-chan.
Nagase made a complete recovery,
so we've been busy making up for lost time
and she said that she felt the same way.
Or so we thought,
You're always early, Inaba.
I wasn't able to finish up at home.
To feel better by blowing off steam.
You're able to reduce your own stress by taking it out on me...
H-Hey!
To do what?!
I know.
Inaba?
What was that all about?
I think I called you unconsciously.
I still feel the same way I did then.
So...
There's trouble.
Huh?
I don't know any details,
I was going to tell you anyway.
You guys looked way too serious.
If they try to punish her,
I was also wondering about that.
grapple with a bunch of boys.
As I mentioned before,
Is it against the rules to hide in our rooms?
could be just as entertaining.
come across some dirty pictures.
I-I don't know how far I would have gone.
I think...
to avoid any stress build-up.
Sucking up won't do you any good.
Hm? Is it a bad idea?
Is everyone else doing okay?
Sometimes, I wonder if this is really okay.
Yui, are you still in bed?
The girl in your club.
So what desire was unleashed?
If I hadn't woken up, they would have called an ambulance.
It's only natural for a brother to love his sister!
Have you ever had the urge to break
And suddenly I had an urge to shout...
If everyone thinks I'm being myself
Anyway, you guys have some tame desires.
I told her about Heartseed.
I mentioned that the five of us needed to talk together.
If he makes Yui cry again,
Name five good things about Kiriyama Yui!
Wait, I need more than five!
Is this a new form of bullying?
Wait, Taichi?
Wait, Taichi!
I have to go help Kiriyama!
Are you sure that will work?
are driven by your current circumstances, right?
I wasn't ogling you!
What do you mean by that?
We need to go to Yui's house today.
If you show up looking so grim, Yui might end up feeling worse.
Yes?
No way, why?
Yeah, all of the StuCS members are here.
I'll be back at school soon.
First, her BWH is an A
Wow, that's terrifying.
That's silly.
Well?!
Inaban!
Don't ask me!
I just wanted to know what was going on
That's what I want to know!
Hey, shouldn't you help out?
Stop, that's enough.
Oh, yeah.
How can you just give up?!
I'm disappointed, Inaba.
Student Cultural Society
Inaban, Taichi, and me... we all have the worst timing.
who doesn't want to see Yui look sad!
I've always thought that humans
Yes, I could have.
You only said those things because you were worried about Yui.
about what she said to Yui than about
but if she keeps it up, Heartseed might try something.
You need to think ahead!
Hog all the glory?!
I'm going to save Kiriyama!
want to see Yui look sad!
I didn't mean that.
What's wrong? Why are the lights off?
so I was wondering if you were sick.
That's no good.
Oh...
Oh, Inaban!
You're a fan of hers?
And we must include Fujishima-san as one of our girls!
everything about Fujishima-san?!
The class representative is
obligated to uphold love and peace in the class.
That doesn't give you the right to boss us around!
and Watase-kun will be one group.
Yeah, I'm so glad you were there, Yaegashi.
Oh, Fujishima.
He's my rival.
What?!
What would you do
Or talking to that person and making something happen?
Me?
That's why I ended up hurting Inaba, arguing with Aoki,
to avoid hurting anyone.
But when I actually tried to distance myself, I realized
Well, it does make sense.
But I never thought I'd hear you say
that it doesn't matter if we hurt each other.
just told me and bring back the whole club?
Uh, well...
I thought you said it's inevitable that we'd hurt each other?
Aoki?
Huh?
Taichi, I'm sorry!
But I still...
I have no idea
I took your advice.
You mentioned that swapping personalities
Don't worry, "Mom"!
Come in.
How many times do I have to repeat myself?
You can stop yourself from beating someone up!
That's how it works.
come to school,
I practice karate, so it's happened before.
Right?
your desire to not hurt anyone will probably triumph.
So I think I kinda understand how you feel.
You came to school, Yui!
It's too late to return them now.
These are all mine!
It's not over yet.
No, that's not what I mean.
Isn't there something else you care about just as much?
I'll return control to this body's owner
the moment before you hit.
Are you going to visit anyone else?
We were wondering why you were late.
If we're late, Fujishima will start griping.
It feels like it's been ages since we just chatted about nothing.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Inaba.
Help me out here!
Yaegashi-kun, you will be punished later.
Watase-kun, can you think of a suitable punishment?
You look happy.
Now, now, now.
How can you be so bad at rock-paper-scissors?
Why are you smiling?
I do a lot of cooking at home.
Wh-Why are you so excited?
I got the rice.
Not yet. Wait a little longer.
Um, are you listening to me?
Man, they need to mind their own business.
Wh-What is it, Iori?
i1She knows!
i1She knows! She knows!
Are you in love with Taichi too?
Did you want to let me have him?
Iori, are you having an episo
But in high school, I made friends for the first time!
Even if you're worried that
I can't do that!
Don't talk about yourself like that!
You're wrong, Inaban.
That's not the point.
It's not that simple!
Er, I still don't, really...
Why are you still lying to yourself?!
I'm not lying.
Using people to her advantage!
Just so you know,
or better, to let you know
Fell?
i1Taichi!
You look really pale.
And he ended up falling down.
I don't know what's wrong, but it was all my fault!
What? Were you really that worried?
You think?
So don't worry.
I'll see you in the clubroom tomorrow.
Shut up, stupid.
A Story That Began As We Realized It
- Just now, I found out about a huge secret! - Here you go, some fried egg!
All right, that's the last of it.
But I am a prince! See?
Up in smoke?
But what should I do? I can't seal--
This particular god loves talking!
Any words will do?
Like "I wanna sleep with a hot woman," or "I want to bust that jerk." Anything!
Oh, right. I guess having a great logo ties it all together.
Now, now, let's forget about small things.
I've already picked our committee.
Like it's not your problem.
It isn't our problem!
An apathetic youth, locked up in his own shell.
iRon!i
Shousuushi! Little Four Happiness
I'm gonna go complain to Shimaccho.
Mishima!
- Sorry! - We'll be right there!
I heard he should be here.
Well, yeah.
Offer up some human sacrifices, and I'll be happy to switch you out.
You're too nice!
That might be just the thing!
Where did that come from?
I'm a music teacher, you know.
Recitations and choirs, year after year.
That car...
Yeah, I think these brakes are history.
Then use mine.
Yes.
No, just by name.
She's raising her daughter single-handedly! Isn't that admirable?
Nope, doesn't exist.
It kind of sends chills down your spine, doesnt it?
maybe singing the lines helps get your feelings across better.
Yamaji, you set him straight!
Right!
If they have something to say, they should just speak up.
Right. Pretty mind-blowing.
I was just randomly singing out a story I heard from some old guy here.
Look, don't you think it's unproductive to do this by text?
You're asking if it's better?
dont you think you should try singing?
Maybe singing doesn't count for the curse.
So let's pick one of these and- -
I dont think it's half bad, this idea.
Shooting off your mouth like that when you dont know a thing.
What do you know about Dai, anyway?
- Shouldnt I get the teacher?
Dai!
If what Sakagami said got to you. That was nothing but--
Oh, man, miso potatoes!
You sure know a lot about it.
Yeah, what should I do?
Welcome home!
Thank you for your hard work.
My feelings...
Is that a friend?
So what happens in the end?
I can't write songs from scratch, so...
we can just stick some lyrics into existing songs.
The lyrics are yours, remember?
I see.
Turn what you really want to say into a story.
Text me if youre running late.
Of course it's not!
Oh, the thing is...
Naruse wrote it?
Oh, the ending isn't done yet.
Yeah...
Youre wrong about that!
I wish you disappeared from my sight!
Words can hurt people!
- Is she okay? - A doctor! No, an ambulance!
- Excuse me, youre disturbing the other customers.
The neighbors always gossip about you.
I... I'm so tired!
You think so?
Huh? Dai!
We have practice in the gym...
- The game, my injury... that's all on me. - Hold up, Dai!
Yamaji...
- I'm going to practice. - Yamaji!
We've only got a month and a bit before the Outreach event.
But...
Right, committee member?
Of course!
Hey, what about casting?
After the girl dies, everyone realizes the truth, right?
At least youre a human!
And of course, all the main characters were forced upon the committee members.
GirlJun Naruse EggDaiki Tasaki PrinceTakumi Sakagami
Taku, your friend is here!
Just once, when we were thinking up the story. He set music to my words with the piano.
It never really seemed possible till now...
My mom who left us, and...
Can I help?
The people in our class all have their talents and skills.
This is the new ending.
Sure, they're gloomy, but...
The part where she shouts out, "I love you."
Stop! Stop!
What's the problem, Aizawa?
Sorry about this, Naruse.
but the discord between my parents only got worse.
Anyway, what I wanted to suggest was,
Sakagami, youre amazing. Youre amazing.
The Shin of Youth GirlJun Naruse EggDaiki Tasaki PrinceTakumi Sakagami
Morning!
Same here. I'm still worried about the choreography.
Oh, right!
All right, it's getting late, so clear up and get out of here!
Those guys.
All right. Hey.
Aren't you acting a little weird lately?
Dating.
I thought it would really be over between us. All this time...
Does that mean...
We should get going. Everyone's waiting.
it's not just about words.
You have a heart that talks too much.
Stop it!
Your egg is full of cracks now.
I'm very disappointed in you.
All right, It's time for...
Community Outreach Event To think it would snow at this time of year!
No. And we haven't heard from anyone else, either.
Not hearing back from the guys patrolling outside, either.
Hey! When you two went back to the classroom yesterday,
That's kind of a jerk move by Naruse, don't you think?
What are you gonna do?
she ignored it so she could push on.
And since I saw that...
Why, hello. Ms. Naruse!
The first years just finished their performance now.
It all started with...
What?
Have you lost your nerve?
I might have been running away from making things clear.
All right, then let's go!
Let's go, Naruse.
- Naruse- - - Dont come near me!
My stomach will start hurting again, dont you see?
Because I spoke up, I became unhappy!
I need him to exist, or I'd be lost!
What am I supposed to do?
Or I wouldnt know what to do!
You have a sweet voice, you know.
I dont mind if I get hurt.
Is that all? All your words of truth?
but you do have so many things you want to convey.
We were worried.
So listen,
I'm gonna go confess my feelings to Naruse.
So I wont have much spare time...
So, can I step away for a second?
Morning!
I'm starving.
Nobuko, over here!
Why not? I like it. Anyway, you're one to talk.
You should try making your own.
I have to see Grandmother.
I should get dinner going.
- Today's spots are very distinct! - And they form a straight line.
Thanks.
Don't they ever clean this place?
Do it for her, hero.
You help them, Umi. My handwriting is terrible.
You're a junior. Got Suzuki for physics?
Then you need this.
All hands on deck. Time for today's meeting.
That poem in the paper...
- You were saying? - No, it's okay.
Can I help with anything else?
There's a debate after school. Why don't you come?
Sorry, I'm busy today.
Sorry, Tomoko's off today. I have to be back early.
We must build a new society on the ruins of the old.
Wait your turn!
Want to demolish something? Demolish your own heads.
Democracy doesn't mean you can ignore the minority.
Stand fast, men!
A white flower was blooming
Debates are always like that.
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.
Oh no...the fish!
You read signal flags?
The gate's open.
The sushi's here.
But I never stopped raising those flags.
Yes.
Isn't he handsome? That's when they got married.
I'm back.
for helping us to preserve this magnificent cultural landmark.
We've been over that.
She wouldn't let you go.
It's like some cheap melodrama.
Give me that for a sec.
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED, TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!
Something about a direct appeal.
I can't believe you'd say that. You don't know your pastries.
We escaped.
I help out with the school paper.
I can't see the tug passing by from the garden.
Mom!
I'm wide awake.
This one?
I'm afraid this is all a little bit complicated.
I was pregnant with you and working on my degree.
Your father was so good-hearted. Maybe just a little impulsive.
The third man in the photo is here.
Beneath that horizon
That's my dad's tug.
All right, let's do it.
Meeting you two is like seeing my old friends again.
If I walk down that gentle slope
I sing it high and low

I didn't hear anything.
Komi, I'm not sure, but
Oh. This won't work.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
HOW CAN I TALK? WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER THAT?
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
I'M SORRY.
Huh? Were you bothering me?
ANYWAY.
I THOUGHT I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.

Peaceful... Oh?
The nickname of the Madonna of the school
Next!
Oh, you dropped your era-
Having a peaceful and ordinary high school life
Being a normal person, this objective was perfect for-
By the way, nobody realized it until now?
I'm not able to...
I would like to be able to talk to others
i1Sorryi0
When did you cause me problems?
Since Komi-san si has troubles speaking to others...
Remember
She is... dazzling
If you can say this then you'll be easily able to have 100 friends
I know it well
Tadano-kun doesn't know it!
Must we read the textbooks out loud?
Yes like this!
an8All these trivial delights
an8if only I could tell you
Hm? What's up, Tadano-kun?
she wants to...
You're nothing more than horseshit, so you should be grateful that you even get to
if I don't even have any friends myself, there's no way I can do it!
She might be able to get along even with Komi-san...
Hm?
Ah!
...and Komi-san?
an8Weren't you a boy in middle school? Didn't you wear the boys' uniform?
i1This is just how Osana Najimi is...
Hold on, Mrs. Najimi, you can't say the title of a light novel in front of the masses!
Wow...
Huh? Yeah, my childhood friends!
I wonder if my body would be able to quell Tadano-kun's insatiable lust..
an8Please stop. Komi-san is here too.
the words we practiced earlier...
If you could maybe become friends with Komi-san.
Oh...
Komi-san!
Ko... Komi-san.
I get the shivers.
Ah, no, someone like me is in a different leagu,e well below Komi-san.
Heh... okay.
Just like when you wanted to confess to a girl you liked,
Stop, don't mention that!
Is there any secret to that?
Mhm!
please go out with me!
i1Is he a girl?
Oh!
Ugh
i1They couldn't overcome it after all.
Did you know?
Good grief, what a pain.
The other time when I was at the store...
and extra extra whipped cream from Standbakes?
If you don't, you'll no longer be my friend!
It's fine, the shop is pretty close!
It's painful even for me
You can stop talking now.
You're about to laugh.
I take them all in
But, keep in mind...

 Hmm? What do you want Tadano-kun?
Who do you think you are?

Komi-san, do you remember how we first met?

That surprised me, but it's just more of Najimi's childhood friends...
Oh, that is...
What is it?
They probably just misunderstood...
Eh!
She was able to speak with a stranger.
Is he eating alone?
Mine's from a convenience store...

It refers to the difficulty communicating with others

My eyesight isn't the greatest,
Don't tell me... Komi-san...

She must really want to beat me
That's her weight and sitting height!
She's taller, but I'm shorter and heavier.
Yeah, it's rude if I stare too much
Huh...
Good morning Komi...
This is the Yamai style "invitation to eat lunch together"!
I don't know what Komi-san is thinking without Tadano-kun!
This... where is it?
I'm hungry
Okay, we'll wait here
I'll bury you there later

What did you say to her?

I heard that!
Hey! We're starting!
Komi?
Hang on.
AFTER THAT, I GOT NAJIMI TO TAKE ME.
Subtitle translation by: Claire Tanaka
The principal of Takamitsuka school collaborated with the construction company.
And what else are you hiding?
I can't tell you because I made a promise that we'll do our best together.
It must be because he thinks that if he exposed that person, it will definitely make the situation worse than it is now.
If that girl was part of the dormitory, it would be totally fitting...
But to think it really was you!
Tomorrow, at the emergency teachers' meeting.
And I want to always have the meals that Umi makes.
I want to be with everyone happily until the end.
Eh...
I agree on that too.
To be so carefree like this...
It's decided then.
I didn't say anything like that. But what I can say is only that this meeting has yet to begin!
He had family that was part of the government...
No matter how it comes out, the result has already been decided.
What do you mean by this?
The situation has changed. We have to do this again.
Of course. We'll rest a while first.
Those who save themselves will be saved by fate.
Even if it isn't very conspicuous, it's already very obvious.
And the third time was for a friend.
That... That...
Isn't this more distrusting instead?
Mitamura Takashi. Suspended five times.
Regarding Hoshino's expulsion from school as punishment for mischief, for those who strongly oppose, please raise your hands.
The secret scheming of the Minamisakou Island hotel resort development plan?
And then we'll have an approval of eleven and opposition one.
be1The new semester starts today, you know.
be1You're wrong! In fact, I don't remember anything.
be1They take an effort in club activities too.
be1How troublesome, you must come one hour before the opening ceremony.
be1I'm chairman of the student council, Asakura Naoko.
be1It's okay, forget it.
be1That's why, you...
be1Transfer student? Why at this time?
be1From today I will be a friend of you all.
be1Sharing a bed?
be1The place is outside on the 218th step of the stairs.
be1S-Sensei, careful with your step.
be1What? Student council?
be1It would be good if we can be friends.
be1Welcome to Tsugumi Dormitory.
be1Though?
be1It's for Sawaki-san's welcome party.
be1We mustn't start before she arrives.
be1Thank God, it just started.
be1Umi, give it up.
be1
be1Because of influence, the families of authorized people from Temizugawa Heavy Industry...
be1If you're deeply involved with me, won't it bring more pain?
be1I stay not only to continue the dormitory, but for the sake of the dorm members at school.
be1I will drag you along for sure.
be1It's decided, our separation will be very sad.
be1Although it's sad and lonely...
be1And after many years of suffering, finally when the wound is closed.
be1It becomes an unforgettable memory.
be1Im not. If you want to be separate from your friends and me...
be1It won't become like that, right?
be1I'm sure, I won't be the girl you think I am.
be1Run run run, to the blue sky, to the middle of blue ocean.
be1Run run run, through the asphalt, past the wind.
Welcome home! Welcome home!
What time do you think it is right now?
Then, next, Hoshino.
She's attracted to me?
Don't you remember?
At that time, she arrived.
Yes, Tsugumi Dormitory here.
Eh? But...
That time you really helped me.
Eating together everyday, can you promise this?
Hmm, don't you ever think there's a meaning to having a match with your enemy in their speciality?
Ah, I found you, wait Hoshino.
Thank God, Wataru arrived in time.
She wants to control my pace.
The match hasn't end yet.
Thanks, Takashi-san.
What must I do now? I can't let her run from us everyday.
The Tsugumi Dormitory urgent members meeting is now open.
That's why, how do I say,
I'm obviously celebrating!
Yes, I only meet him when I was a child.
the school building was changed into dormitory.
After this, I must visit another place...
Osechi?
Do you hate it?
101, 102, 103.
Since she's family of the founder of Temizugawa Heavy Industry,
108, 109, 110.
In brief, she became the successor since Rokujou grandfather passed away last year.
This is the 118th stairs.
One two...
The stairs increase by one, so it becomes 13 stairs.
But, in the dance room,
Give it to me.
But, I'm the owner.
Senpai, are you nervous?
Even if it's so, following the footprints of Rokujou Kiichiro is somewhat...
the name of grandfather is William Elgar.
Since he had experience in teaching school,
he started the Takamizuka Gakuen School with his private finances.
He became the board chairman.
Wherever she is, she's so clumsy.
Sensei is an Englishman.
In the villa of Rokujou family lived your grandmother, Miyako-san, who's been having a medical treatment.
The reason why Temizugawa used South Sakoujima Island to establish is,
One day, when the girl was looking from the window,
For both of them, it's their fateful day of meeting each other.
Ah, thanks goodness the dust didn't get on me.
I want to touch Miyako's beautiful long hair.
Miyako, Miyako, Miyako.
Miyako, Miyako, Miyako.
Since he's a tutor, he tried so hard to control himself.
Why? Why he's so thickheaded?
This is an unpopulated island...
Miyako, let's get married.
Mistress.
be1...Hey, what's going on everyone? It's strange for all of you to become strained like that.
be1Just be quiet, Umi.
be1If you are talking about that, I will do the rest by myself.
be1There are some missing articles from the local newspaper issues 14 and up...
be1And senpai's Grandfather and grandmother were here until we closed.
be1Local Newspaper, issue number 14.
be1There are so many varieties of butterfly on this small island.
be1Be...because, it won't be delicious if we all don't eat it together!
be1sigh
be1He's home, he just came back now.
be1M-Miya...
be1S-Senpai is so selfish!
be1Two volumes of the book of season, 5 volumes of free poem magazine,
be1Huh?
be1Rokujou Kiichirou's Perfect Collection!
be1After that, the illustration of daily weather, the chronological tables,
be1After all, it was all right if I think about free research easily.
be1Merry Christmas!
be1This cake looks delicious!
be1...Miya..
be1This placed reserved by my grandfather...
be1Miya's research, has not ended yet.
be1My mother, Shizu's mother...
Everything must be curious to you, this being your first time in the city.
Konohanatei
She'll teach you what you need to know.
I've prepared some of my kimonos.
I hope you'll be good to me.
So this is our special privilege.
I've never seen anything like it.
You two always lived on your own, huh?
Now, back to wor
Are the outdoor baths this way?
That was an excellent bath.
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
Attendants all share responsibility.
Really, I'm fine.
He thinks I'm just a kid.
You just shut up!
You moron!
That's what you call BS!
You have a strong sense of responsibility, but you ought to loosen up a little.
Um...
Isn't this...
I need to pick up the star that you shot down.
We know that.
Don't do only what's asked of you!
If you don't know what to do, watch someone and learn!
Satsuki-chan is busy enough just taking care of me,
Sakura-chan, where are you going?
It must be because you're finding so many fun things to do.
I'll take good care of it.
O-Oh...
She said it's fun being with me.
Is it fun being with me?
I can let my hair down around you.
Why are you so hyper?
Goodnight.
i1You aren't going to get out of Konohanatei just because you work especially hard.
It'll be a full moon soon.
When did I stop looking up at the sky?
A shame, huh?
Do you want to be putting in all of this work?
I'm sure you're tired, too.
I'll treat you to something nice in return for the cherry blossoms and sake.
And your obi's the wrong color, Yuzu-chan!
Change it!
Thanks.
How cute!
a6The one with its right paw up brings good fortune,
Here you go.
We had a lot of human visitors, too.
I just had time to spare.
I, um... just want to pay my respects to the god.
I want to see where you'll be working.
Sorry.
I have to be careful.
Listen. Stay there so you don't get lost.
I-If it's okay, I'd like to help you look for her.
I'm glad you understand.
Find my sister for me.
Sorry, I don't know the area very well.
Is she selfish?
Why don't you join me?
It's noble work, serving the gods.
She's near the great cherry blossom tree.
This calls for a banquet!
I found you, Satsuki-chan.
She's so kind.
So it's the kind of hospitality only Sakura-chan can provide.
You make me want to polish you up.
Yeah, why is it, Onee-sama?
I would have no idea.
Festival! Festival!
I'm going to ask him to teach me kendo later!
There used to be festivals all the time.
You're the guest who came after they did.
You want to watch me put on makeup?
They get some rest ahead of time.
Move it!
What's the matter, Okiku-chan?
Oh? Is that lady there your friend?
What should I do?
Yes?
Why are you sulking?
I'm not sulking.
Say what?
Okami-san, what should I do about the stuff in here?
I just boiled some soba that I bought at the store.
Should we go this year?
Are you okay?
Hey, isn't that a kenzoku scroll?
Okami-san's past?
Hey, dummy!
What should I pray for?
I want to ring the bell!
Aren't they doing them here?
Where did I put it?
It's almost the end of the year...
S-Sorry!
It depends on whether we, the kenzoku, feel like they deserve our help,
and whether they're wishing this for someone other than themselves.
Those wishes are for people to grant themselves.
Th-That's such a gracious mission!
I'm so moved!
Which means I brought her here by accident.
I told her to go back to Konohanatei if she gets lost.
Wh-What do you mean, I can't go home?
Thank you for curing my mother's sickness.
but to different times, as well.
I know! Let's dig up a hot spring.
What else?
I'm sure she'll be useful.
You're all going to go your own ways eventually, right?
Once I'm free to resign, I'm going to aim to become a priestess again.
He'd never have talked to me like that if I served an Inari shrine.
Even if we're going to part ways someday, even then,
I'm sure it'll work out.
We might not be able to take her back with our powers,
Where did you get that hood?
Yeah.
Are you talking about relaxation therapy again?
You'll have to help when we do, Tsubaki.
Welcome home.
Until we meet again
She's so terrible.
Capable?
N-Nacchan is fine, thanks.
I was not.
Ren was like...
Don't fall for such an old prank, Yuzu.
I-I'm not kind.
Learn to be skeptical of people!
You found me.
Pardon me.
I'll pour the sake.
Okay.
Oh, no! What have I done to a guest?
Don't let it get to you.
The girls are helping you out because you work hard all the time.
Ren, we have guests.
Yes, it must be at least a hundred years.
See you, Grandfather, Grandmother.
Your friend?
I-I have a steamed bun here that I've been saving.
You could tell your friend to express her true feelings, and not bottle them up.
True feelings?
D-D-Don't be crazy!
Pardon me.
Welcome h
No!
Idiot.
What are you even talking about?
Of course I do.
and you make everyone happy, like a large flower.
If it doesn't matter either way, they'd rather have my sister become one.
It can't be anyone else.
Satsuki-chan!
Come say hi sometimes.
It turned into a good dream, and...
What was it called again?
It's me, Yuzu.
Make this baby stop crying.
There doesn't seem to be a guest who could be a mother.
It's for a three-year-old's Shichi-Go-San celebration.
I hope Shino will like it.
Long ago, children were said to belong to the gods until they were seven.
Nothing!
Um...
Do you want to grow up faster?
Oh, that's great.
That's my Ren! You're so kind!
Come in, Onee-san.
She's going through her growth spurt.
Yes.
so that the daughter would marry in the afterlife.
Guests are gods, after all.
How can I?
the fleeting dreams you have here at Konohanatei,
Are you all right, little attendant?
A perfectly clear spring sky.
It truly was like a dream.
Now, then, we have a banquet tonight.
Yes!
As if!
This is me?
Okay.
I think I have some scraps.
Then you should have said so.
You have such pretty eyes.
Your glass is sparkly, and your porcelain skin is so white and clear.
Buy me one, too.
No!
I, uh, don't really have a name.
I'm a top-class Japanese doll made by a master craftsman!
You don't look like a Japanese doll.
Yuzu-chan, can you bring me a washcloth?
It's over in other places already.
Hang on! Do you really need to talk like th
Pardon me.
Special?
You certainly have a long road ahead.
Take this to the guest in the shed, please!
Pardon me.
I brought rice balls.
Leave them there.
No, I mean, the fabric is beautiful, but the way you use your hands is amazing, too.
No, this isn't good enough.
I'm neither, so I want to become able to weave better and faster than they can.
You're right.
Eat when you get hungry, rest when you're tired.
She had no friends either, and she spent all her time alone.
Is it because I'm me?
Am I still not good enough?
S...
Shall we call it a night?
everyone split up to turn the lights back on and make sure the guests are safe.
That's right.
Satsuki-chan?
Of course.
See, on special nights like this one,
You're going too fast.
Do you?
Did she get food poisoning from the miso mackerel we had for dinner?
Well, too bad.
You're the worst!
There's something hot about playing with your own body.
They're seasonal?!
Oh, yeah. Where did she go?
I...
That's crazy.
Bikuni-sama would never kick me out.
Indeed.
Yo, Yuzu-bou.
What was that noise, Yuzu?
Oh, dear.
So please let me stay with you!
That's why you're going to send me away...
That's too complicated. I don't get it.
Was I just dreaming standing up?
Who do you like?
Are you getting on?
With a smile like that, I'm sure you can make everyone love you.
She was a ghost. An evil spirit. Get it?
Yes.
Next Episode: Night of the Summer Festival
From the city.
It's the Yoimiya Festival today.
You've got a bunch of stuff mixed up.
And after the festival, they set it all on fire, and everyone dances around it.
You're making it even worse.
How old are you, Kiri-san?
Sure, I had my share of adventures back in my day.
Are you all right?
Today is when souls come back from the afterlife.
Wow!
All these total strangers gather around a tower and go around and around.
We have to hurry, or the gate will close.
How do you get lost going in circles?
What?
Didn't I learn my lesson then?
I got all dressed up, and she didn't even notice.
I was so sad, I went home without even watching the fireworks.
I thought you weren't having fun.
Why don't you compliment me after all the effort I put in?
Go drown in stuffed squid and return to the sea!
I wish I had a boyfriend like him.
Well, you can't walk, can you?
That's how it was last time.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
It's fine.
If you wouldn't mind, shall I help you look for them?
And I liked drawing.
and when I grew up, I'd go to work.
You didn't deceive me.
Your stories are fun.
Matsumoto-san!
I wanted to see if I could catch them.
Maybe I was yanked by foxes.
This dream I just had...
If he were a guest, I would have stopped you before you hit him.
This is Sakura's job.
She's not like you rich kids who don't need to work.
"You're talented, Kaito. You might be even greater than Dad one day."
I'm sorry.
Kaito, are you awake?
Find happiness with your new family.
I hate this place.
I can't go home to Mom.
I'm never going home!
And really, "Hell"?
That's a sophisticated way to say it.
In the end, we're all dancing on the palm of God's hand.
Don't be stupid!
You're the only one who thinks they haven't figured you out.
Of course.
Be well, brat.
I don't know about my future or anything, but I want to study hard and be able to help.
We didn't take him.
Turtles sure are thoughtful.
What are you trying to accomplish?
I don't know how to say this,
You're supposed to deny that!
To the sea god's shrine!
I took him to the sea god's shrine.
This is stupid.
Let's get back to work.
I'm sorry, but I need to return to work.
Yes, that's right.
What?
Pardon me.
I-I'm sorry.
I have a permit.
I'm counting on you.
Let's work hard, Ren-chan.
I'm sure you're busy with your own work.
Hey, what's up, Yun-tan?
Got it.
Yun-tan, go after that one!
Please wait, mini-nami-sama.
I grew up in the mountains. I have a ton of stamina.
Yuzu!
Well...
Reserved
Awanami-sama is going through her rebirth right now.
Oh, I was taking a stroll through town, when I had a sudden urge.
There are tea and snacks in the attendant room.
She's so cute!
Damn it... Natsume pisses me off.
It relieves the exhaustion of such a long trip.
Yes.
But...
How did you know she came from the mountains?
Nah, I don't have anything more.
I'll do anything if it'll make you normal again.
Thank goodness!
Satsuki-chan!
Well, then...
Hey-ho!
I bet there's some sibling drama.
Who's going to be in charge of their room?
U-Um, I'll do my best, too.
Um...
Satsuki-chan...
I shall accompany you.
I should be happy for that to come true.
My sister's been missing all day.
Thank you!
Oh, dear.
What's the matter, ma'am?
Are the moon dancers not to your liking, Princess?
Yes.
Besides, you have the great Hiiragi-sama with you.
It's because I asked you to dance
Don't get the wrong idea.
She's doing great as an attendant, the job I wasn't chosen for.
I was going to invite her to the shrine

What will be seen?
I can't let you see up my skirt.
Huh?
I see.
You saw them, didn't you?
I don't want to hear your excuses!
you're in a position to supervise the students!
This way, you can increase the level of your intimacy. I went with intimacy because of the line following
What a rough ride that was.
A really scary haunted house.
Zombie... a zombie's hand is...
Hm?
It's nice... Should I get one too?
Right...
i1I thought I had seen them before somewhere, so I was having a look...
I found something in the student council room.
If that's the case, then it's possible to broadcast that voice.
Oh my.
But Kunitachi-san, why do you know about that?
This is only a suggestion,
but can you see if you can find out about his little sister?
My best guess is that he intends to use that information as leverage.
Eh? Engaged?
I found that mobile phone in the rubbish dump.
By the time I realised it,
Yes. That's why I got you to become a public morals committee member.
but I didn't realise at all.
Eh?
Huh?
Lover?!
That's only for you to cancel your engagement.
It's definitely a relationship as a preamble to marriage.
Eh?!!!
be1Don't move. I can't measure it.
be1So, what will it be? Huh?
be1If you're trying to break the dress code, it's got to be at least as short as mine.
be1Did you see? Did you see it?
be1I didn't! I didn't look!
be1Why don't you try going somewhere else?
be1What is this?
be1Are you okay?
be1If we don't go to the bathroom first, we might wet ourselves!
be1President Tendo, if you're that scared, maybe we shouldn't do this...
be1I will pass.
be1I'll get some soft serve while I wait for you.
be1But it's easier said than done...
be1W-What's with that swimsuit?!
be1Kunitachi-san, calm down!
be1Th-That wasn't on purpose!
be1Huh? It's so cuf... what?
be1No, you're wrong.
be1I'm supposed be patrolling with Mikadono-senpai, but where did he go?
be1What are you...
be1I also found this voice changing cell phone in this room.
be1how do you know that?
be1It seems there's no point in hiding it any longer.
be1But I had no choice.
be1It was our parents' decision, but the Genda household is the family I will marry into.
be1So you were saying that not to me, but to Genda.
be1Kunitachi-san, I'm sorry.
be1It is a promise between our families.
be1Huh? But why...
be1What? The inside of my mouth?
be1Next is episode 9,
Hey, Shogo...
A-As a morality officer, I was just trying to
Then please measure mine as well.
Very well, then. How about this?
Maybe I'll hike up my skirt a little, too.
I don't want to hear your excuses!
Senpai! What are you looking at?
Well, Shogo-kun?
As long as you're at school, she's the vice president,
President Tendo!
a6Rinka-chan, look!
a6It looks so good!
My hair is a mess.
If we don't go to the bathroom first,
G-Ghost... Ghost... I saw a ghost...
our power supply system within this facility, we have shut down the power.
No, you're wrong.
It's what?
Morality Officer
into the phone connected to the mic.
It's because you've seen the real thing...
Within the academy is his publicly unknown younger sister.
He probably meant to threaten the group with a scandal
I suddenly came up with that plan.
And when you warned me to be careful of my surroundings,
you were trying to tell me what Genda was up to.
Kunitachi-san, I'm so sorry.
since you saved me,
Huh?
It's time for Shiga-san's check, everyone.
"Surprise Attack! Little Sister Warning!"
...nii-sama...
Who's that? Where are you?
What do you mean?
Marry me?
Seri-san.
q2I had trouble with the final part of the curriculum and couldn't make it in time for the second-year opening ceremony, though.
I have to find a girl I love before I graduate from high school and make her my lifelong companion.
Take this as well.
We've rented an apartment close to the academy.
It will be your new home starting today.
Hey
I can drive you to school if you'll be going now.
I'll walk there with my own two feet.
Today's my birthday.
Today's my first day there, but I got lost on the way over...
Huh? Are you sure?
Oh, it tastes much lighter than I had expected.
Is there a problem with that?
an8Hey, Mikadono. Don't you have more to say?
an8All right.
Mikadono, Tsuruma's the class rep.
Kannagi Miyabi-san.
Kannagi-san doesn't really seem like the type to proactively approach others.
That was... um...
Oh, that's right.
I see. Your memories...
Konoe-chan!
President Tendou.
Hmm...
Oh no, Rinka-chan's mad!
Yeah. Okay.
Well, Kannagi-san...
I wasn't hitting on her.
I can't.
My tongue? Seriously?
Look, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but there's no way I can do that.
Hello?
Happy birthday!
Yes.
I'm the one who's kissing you on the cheek.
Are you really my younger sister?
Give me your name!
I love you, Onii-sama.
When I was wiping the cream off his mouth this morning,
It's all your fault, Shougo-san!
Isn't that obvious?
Walk quietly into that alley over there.
My name is Mister X.
"Seems"?
Marry?
Wh
Isn't that obvious?
I'm trying to keep your sister's scheming hands away from you.
I guess so, but...
Hey!
Got it?
Like hell I would!
I left them drying on the balcony.
A... girl?
Sorry I kept you waiting, Shougo-san.
That's our student council president, Tendou Mana-san.
She's normally a lot quieter,
She's a first-year student, but she's already serving as the student council vice-president.
If you're not confident in your dancing,
Well then, maybe I should get a little serious too.
Don't even bother explaining!
I don't like that kind of stuff.
We can dance together.
Our own little...
Mademoiselle.
Have you seen Shougo-san?
H-How long are you gonna hold my hand for?!
Are you well, Onii-sama?
I'm not going to marry my own sister
When we were hugging earlier, I bet he wanted to see them!
Don't worry, the effects will wear off after one season.
That's illegal!
Simple, if you will.
So that's how babies are made.
D-Do you get it now?
Have kids?
So it was you.
Looks like us siblings really do have things in common.
So a woman's body is better, right?
You want to know who I am, right?
I love my sister!
Well?
Onii-sama.
I am your younger sister.
You're such a sleepyhead.
I see.
We're here to guide you back to the light. Back to liking women.
What the heck's that all about?
You just don't get it, Tsuruma-san.
You're not going to find any siblings who help each other get dressed.
Could this be love?
Then maybe someday, you'll have a nice body like Sensei's.
Shougo-oniichan.
Oh, so you're trying to impregnate Mizutani-kun instead?
Okay!
Shougo-oniichan, you can't fall sleep?
I want you to like women again.
If only she would call...
You shouldn't run!
You slowed us down with your giant butt!
But don't steal ahead just because you found him first.
This is purely hypothetical. A general scenario.
Tsuruma-san went somewhere too.
So this was what you needed to do?
Come on, get in the shower!
You were staring at it pretty intensely, so I thought I'd put it on for you.
Actually, that's a question you should ask the teacher!
More importantly, we have a preview to do!
Yay! Potato chips!
Ikusu, cut it out already.
Also, it's water-resistant.
Konoe.
I bought a brand new car the other day.
It's a cute one too.
Now, she calls me a closet perv and says I have a big butt,
but still, I like the current Kannagi-san better.
So... So I...
So promise me that you'll keep it a secret.
Where did Konoe go?
"Goodbye"?
It was pointed out there was a risk of such voice-changing being used for pranks or serious crimes.
Hey! Mikadono!
Miyabi!
Help me find Konoe.
Why should I?
Where are you, Konoe?
I...
Yeah.
I was much happier than usual.
Hey, wait up!
Watch out!
Do you remember what you said after pushing me out of the way?
I took down your address and your phone number.
Huh? But she always referred to Grand Bellion as "Onii-sama."
I see now.
I'm sorry.
N-No, you're wrong.
Well, now that the misunderstanding is cleared,
Oh, so you forgot about that too.
Until my dad's appointments were over, the two of us would play in the courtyard.
and I couldn't see you anymore.
I cried every day.
You didn't seem to remember me at all.
I'm serious about wanting to marry you.
Fine. I'll take you on.
Of course!
but they were never really friends.
Man, it's just 6 o'clock!
I was just doing my homework.
One of the class rep's duties is to ensure students have a proper school life!
Wait, what kind of class rep is she?
Because I'm your...
What?
But even if we allow the possibility that it was someone else,
Oh right, after the previous sister fiasco,
R-Right...
Good morning, Onii-sama.
Yeah, well, I haven't been getting enough sleep...
Maybe I'll use this lunch break to nap at the infirmary.
Mikadono.
I'll allow it just this once.
So this is your hiding spot?
Huh?
It's not something a future company president should do!
I wasn't able to clock some good times.
Uh, it's supposed to be around here.
Hey.
O-O-Onii-chan?
I'm your slightly cheeky and somewhat precocious little sister!
The Tsundere Sister's Spicy Omelette Rice?
I'll have a chocolate parfait.
You've finally come to my cafe.
What?!
Who is it?
Onii-chan, welcome back meow
I came here for a nap, but I'm wide awake now.
Um, Senpai.
Sure. Ask me anything.
I apparently solved even university-level problems with ease.
Eventually, a university professor heard about me.
I did think you were extraordinary in a sense,
My dad left to lecture at a university in Massachusetts.
I used that money to buy back my mother's cafe.
Just like you, I ruled out the possibility at first.
Is that rumor true?!
No... it's still too soon!
Sorry if my being delusional has caused any problems!
TEL
My, what an adorable little waitress.
It's something I promised my father.
Let's think of how to get lots of customers and make business boom!
He may have Mikadono Kumagorou's blood, but he's still an amateur.
A delineation for an advertisement.
Uh, I have no idea what you just said, but there's one condition for the interview.
Very well.
We're making flyers next, so I was wondering if I could make them any better.
Um...
It's a trade secret I'm currently filing a patent for!
What do you mean, naughty panties?!
You put the omelette over the chicken rice before it's fully cooked, and...
Kunitachi-san, you're as good at cooking as they say!
Don't worry.
Are you okay?
Welcome back, my Onee-chans!
I'd like one too!
I heard it's gotten quite busy here, so I've come to help.
Heck yes!
Please share those wonderful genes with me.
You can stop joking now.
Don't tell me you were spying on us.
I see.
I suppose I did make a big mistake, though.
so I made an advance on you, thinking you were interested in me.
I didn't think you'd reject me that quickly.
I didn't think you'd believe me if I said I forgot, so I decided to go all-or-nothing.
First, she'd cause you sleep deprivation by calling you early every morning.
Mikadono, you really surprised me.
I was still a little girl when I first met her at my mother's cafe.
Geez, backing away just like that? You're too nice a person.
I guess so.
Well...
Tsuruma-kun and Kannagi-kun's advances are bothering you?
I think you mentioned that before.
That's why you shouldn't personally request for the test and instead entrust it to someone you can trust.
It'll be good for all of us in the long run.
There we go.
Fill this container with your bodily fluids.
Bodily fluids?
Pee maniac!
Hey!
Oh? What's this?
So please fix your tie and make sure you don't embarrass the students of Miryuu Academy.
Say, "ah."
Ah, so you're Kumagorou's son.
Please believe that Mikadono Shougo doesn't have a sister.
It's the only way everyone can become happy.
Got it? You need to be careful of those around you.
It's not going to lead us to the culprit.
Wait a minute!
but from now on, the student council will take the initiative to correct student behavior on campus.
Shiga-san, give it to Mikadono-senpai.
Y-Yes!
During the time the sister's message was being broadcasted,
What was that about?
If all goes well, we might get our answer!
Man!Unless we want to keep the pun.
No recruiting in school!
Not now.
Here. Say "Ah."
No flirting in school!
Otherwise...
Kannagi-san, Sagara-senpai!
But this skirt is in line with the school rules.
Stop moving, or I won't be able to measure it.
Is Miyabi using seduction to get me to quit being a disciplinary officer?
I-I see.
Hey!
It's dangerous to run around like that!
What's this?
Kunitachi-san, you've never seen a rollercoaster before?
Rinka-chan's family is really strict.
Why don't you come with me, President Tendou? I'll treat you.
I see why we had to change into swimsuits.
Nice!
Let's get on that too.
W-Wait!
It's so nice and furry!
I-I don't!
What do you mean by that?
Playing dumb won't work.
When the person who claimed to be my sister was broadcasting that message, you were nowhere to be found.
Are you trying to say that I'm the culprit?
My, my.
How would you know that?
It doesn't look like I can hide it any longer.
It's the first time I've heard that.
He probably intends to flaunt the scandalous information to push the deal to his advantage.
Deep down, I didn't want to assist him in this scheme.
With that in mind, I was halfway towards giving up when, one day, I found that cellphone by the dumpster.
Someone without the pressure of an elite family behind them...
Someone who didn't have to marry for the family's reputation...
And with the board of directors' inspection coming up,
So that wasn't directed at me, but at Genda?
You're the victim, in fact.
Oh come on, don't ask why.
Of course I'd make you your lunch.
Shougo!
Well, everyone, it's time for the regular Shiga-san's Check!
"A Sudden Attack! Be Wary of Sisters!"
This bed's expensive, so stop knocking it!
Does that mean...
I see.
Second cousin?
When my real mother passed away,
Daddy Kumagorou entrusted me to my current parents and asked them to raise me.
Huh? Onii-sama, what's this?
Huh?
You will eventually be the company president,
That's right.
Yes.
What is it, Tanaka?
It's no good?
You're all having fun.
Oh.
I was in the area and figured I should find out more about this school,
I wouldn't lie about this.
Well, I don't think you're lying,
A womanizer?!
to the Mikadono Group's thank-you party as a partner?
As a partner?
I-I was naked with Shougo-san on his bed!
But I was there too!
Me... me...
Why would it be you?!
What the hell are you doing?!
Of course, I will do it anonymously, so have no worries in that regard.
Good night to you too.
Your times aren't improving.
Oh, there'll be dessert after dinner tonight.
Kannagi Miyabi.
Looks like we made Houshou-san angry.
It's your fault, Shougo-san.
Geez, there you go trying to avoid me again!
I had no idea what you wanted.
Well...
Well, yeah.
Would you like me to escort you to the party?BEST GIRL
H-Hey, stop teasing me here...
We're finally here!
Wh-What are you doing?!
Is there a problem?NONE AT ALL. HNNNNGG.
Uh...
We'll show you to the ballroom.
However, in these uncertain socio-economic times,
So good!
Sagara-senpai.
I don't see Kannagi anywhere.
Like she was worrying about something.
My...
Seriously, where did Miyabi go?
It was in the bag in the cloakroom, just like you said.
Unfortunately, it's not clearly written that he has an illegitimate child,
We need to tell my mom, quick!
Thanks.
You be careful too, Shougo-kun.
That's probably it.
She must've found out you were my sister from that DNA test and looked for something she could use as proof.
Despite how Kannagi-san seems, I think she really is a delicate person.
That's probably why she can't be honest with you despite her feelings for you.
She should've been able to tell from the first sip!
We noticed and tried to warn her, but she took the glass and emptied it in one go.
She found me!
H-Hey, Miyabi!
It's true that we were separated once,
Miyabi...
Thank you very much for inviting me to this wonderful party.
What on Earth were you doing today?
I don't want to hear your excuses!
Be sure to thank her properly later.
It's as powerful as the dragon that flies in the sky and gathers the clouds!
Newlyweds?!
I was told that she caught a cold or something.
No, no solid leads yet.
Okay.
Hmm, it looks like I've reached my activity limit.
How embarrassing! Oh gawd!
Yes?
One bag can't make three cups of tea...
Shougo-san, I'll be back soon.
Thanks so much again.
It can't be.
an8Endou.
an8Ozaki.
Ooh, nice answer.
Sounds like your cold's gone.
An interview with me?!
That's right!
my alternate personality demands that I have an interview with you, the new Little Mermaid of the Age of Aquarius!
What?
Wow! This look delicious!
Ahh, I can't decide!
Kunitachi-san.
Sorry I took so long!
Let me guess. You're speechless after seeing me?
Come on, let's go.I NEED ME A MIYABI
By the power of my Crystal, I see the future...
Somewhere nice? Where?
Welcome!
Yes!
Is something happening today?
Sorry, Miyabi.
I initially regretted doing something that let Seri-san know who my sister is.
You're thinking too much.
But what about those invitations you had for everyone else?
Ikusu?
Few speak of her anymore.
She started drowning at morning practice, but it's nothing serious.
I need to apologize to you.
The funeral was on the same day as the entrance exam for Miryuuin Academy.
That's right. It was me.
I told you about how my dad and Kumagorou-san met at the hospital, right?
My parents are divorced.
Since you had lost your father, I figured I'd console you.
But I was nervous.
But Houshou-san said...
Then I'll explain myself.
From Kumagorou-san.
I want to confirm if it's real or not.
Don't tell me...
It was about an hour before you and Tsuruma-san came to see me.
So you have no proof that you're his sister.
That way, as his sister, I can help bring you two together.
So that's why she said she saw Konoe at the funeral that day.
We're siblings.
Ahh, she was so close to getting past the preliminaries.
You broke your own personal record. You did great.
I see.
So Yuzurina disappeared.
I pulled a few strings, so the opposition probably won't try anything again anytime soon.
overlapWhat about my strawberry?!
Onii-chan's mine!
Shougo-kun's so popular.
Preparing a funeral is pretty tough work.Begin match to episode 1.Matched.
Because we're siblings.
What day?
You know, Dad's funeral.
I can be graceful if I want to!
Breakfast... huh?
It's good!
Just to my tastes!
Let's try Kunitachi-san's next.
Let's see...
Geez, then I'll just have to feed you both!
Tsuruma-senpai,
We got 'em cheap!
...potato chips from Thinhair Inc. that came on the market 15 years ago but got discontinued in an instant,
It's a pancake!
Really?
Want these instead?
Yes...what the fuck
The easiest way for me to keep an eye on Miyabi is to marry you.
You're embarrassing me!good liberal
Dear, it's about time.
Who knows what'll happen if I let you keep going?!
...this!
They're holding a bridal fair today.
Who's that? Where are you?
But I'm an only child.
Shougo-sama, all of your belongings have already been moved there.
R-Right.
I guess Mom was too busy to remember.
Are you okay?
What about your cake?
Every morning, I eat cream puffs in that park over there!
Oh, it tastes much lighter than I had expected.
Must be that.
It's as if we've known each other for a long time.
Is there a problem with that?
That's Kannagi-san.
Look, look! It's Mikadono-kun!
I shouldn't give you more trouble.
N-No, that's not what I meant...
Liar. Your face is all red.
There's a lot I can't really remember.
I see. Your memories...
You must be grossed out.
Are you okay, Shougo-san?
Konoe-chan!
You're such a player to be hitting on girls right after transferring in.
This one.
What?!
You're using different words to mean the same thing!
Fine!
Refrigerated food delivery here!
Present? So it's from you?
We've been separated for such a long time,
but I'm really happy we could meet again.
Tell me.
Give me your name!
Oh, morning.
What's wrong, Shougo-san?
Hey! Stop!
Sir! Yes, sir!
Wait, you don't know?
You want to find out about his illegitimate child?
Then that means last night's call was...
I'm Mizutani Ikusu, and I'll be joining your class starting today.
Y-Yes! Absolutely!
No need to worry.
You just need to collect her saliva using a kit and send the sample to a lab.
I get the feeling we created a huge misunderstanding instead...
Go right ahead.
I'll be right back.
Got it?
Like hell I would!
That's right, we saw the release of a new model this time last year.
What do you think, Shougo-kun?
You're as wonderful as always.
The student council welcomes you to this dance party!
She's normally a lot quieter,
Dance with me next!
Well then, maybe I should get a little serious too.
I-I'm not going to lose!
Careful!
W-Wait!
This was an unfortunate accident!
I don't want to dance with you.
So what do you want to do?
I want to dance with you, Miyabi.
Because...
Please give me the moment of my dreams.
Did you see?
No! No way!
I don't trust you.
Liar!
What should I do, then?
Okay, there you go.
You can look now, Shougo-san.
Miyabi!
So it's you.
If I push them together, maybe I'll get some cleavage.
When we were hugging earlier, I bet he wanted to see them!
He tried to hide it, but I knew!
Stop right there!
I gave you the injection that messes up your speech and makes you salivate.
"The Thistas' Theducshon."
Good morning, Shougo-kun.
I figured I'd stop by and shower since your place is so close to the school.
You could've told me.
That's illegal!
That way, even if your mysterious sister tries to approach you, she can't marry you.
We will build a happy family.
Have kids? Are you nuts?!
You don't have to recite it!
No... uh, this is...
It's definitely nothing suspicious.
Do you want to see my naked body in the bath?
At this rate, you won't be able to marry a woman and have kids with her!
It's the cafe of your dreams.
but we figured it was better than being gay.
I can help you get dressed.
You just don't get it, Tsuruma-san.
You're not going to find any siblings who help each other get dressed.
Any brother would be attracted to a more realistic sister.
You left your boxers lying around again!
It's all because you left them lying around like that.
Eat up and take a nap!
Then maybe someday, you'll have a nice body like Sensei's.
Shougo-oniichan.
Not that I mind at all.
Okay!
Maybe it's because of all that swimming.
Ah, it's nice and cool.
I want you to like women again.
Shou-nii, you need to be cured!
Like hell I'd wait!
You're diligent, quiet, and seem like a model student, but the truth is...
But don't steal ahead just because you found him first.
W-Well...
And I have something to do...
Oh right, you're in the swim club.
Uh, maybe...
Yeah, I think I'll go with the Kyouasu brand.
They could become a strong competitor for our company.
Why would Miyabi have something from such an old series?
Wh-What?
Hey, Rinka-chan.
Huh?! W-Well, uh...
What was it again?
How should I put it?
Miyabi.
Oh, nothing really.
I bought a brand new car the other day.
I'd rather piggyback you than have you drive a car!
Togetherfscx150
Kotori Attack!
Kannagi-san was acting strange today.
O-Okay...
What does that mean?
I think I figured out what voice changer she's using.
They apparently bought the technology from some start-up company.
It was pointed out there was a risk of such voice-changing being used for pranks or serious crimes.
No way!
Is something wrong, Shougo-kun?
Find Tsuruma-senpai?
Okay!
Wait! President!
Mikadono.
Why are you in such a rush?
Wait!
Goodbye, Onii-sama.
Konoe!
I am your sister.
That day was no exception.
Yeah, but that was just her admiring him as a brother.
Yes. It was just meant to be a little prank.
I'm sorry.
I was only planning on doing it once,
When we were kids, I wanted to be your sister.
But I'm the one who caused it!
But...!
Well, now that the misunderstanding is cleared,
Childhood...
I kept praying for the day I would get to see you again.
It's you.
I'm your younger sister.
but they were never really friends.
Shougo-san, you had a make-believe wedding with Kannagi-san back when you were a kid, right?
Oh, you're finally up, Shougo.
Okay?
Any more Hard as a Boss and I'll...
Konoe? Why are you...
You're spacing out...
It's nothing!
Really, it's nothing.
Konoe-chan, congrats!
Konoe, I love you.
using the phone's voice changer to pretend to be my mysterious sister.
I'm sorry.
you have amassed the interest of many students in our school.
Sleeping in again today?
You're so pervy, Onii-sama!
Geez, don't scare me like that!
Yeah, well, I haven't been getting enough sleep...
Geez, Shougo. Why would you do that here?
You're so bold!
There's a much better place to have a nap, you know.
Well, I'd be grateful for a place to nap, but are you sure about this?
It's a secret between you and me.
What do you mean by that?
Um...
Wow, this place sure is messy.
H-Hey!
Uh, it's supposed to be around here.
Onii-chan, Onee-chan.
Geez.
I just wanted to test out this new cat tail equipment.
Sure. Ask me anything.
That would mean Sagara-senpai's the mysterious sister this time...
Huh?
What's more, she was picked up when she was one or two years old, and she doesn't know when she was born exactly.
Is that rumor true?!
It's finally time for my preview!
The air shall grow thick with the scent of catnip as the girls start pruning themselves lewdly!
Next week: Episode 6.
Because...
A delineation for an advertisement.
The Manga Society's club room.
Kukukukuku.
What are you sighing about?
We're making flyers next, so I was wondering if I could make them any better.
Wait...
I'll be a super-moe waitress!
Well, now that we've seen Tsuruma-san's naughty panties...
Good luck with the swim training.
All right. I'll put it on our menu today.
Elitism is a very fine moe quality.
I know, but when I think about wearing this in front of people,
Not there! Anywhere but there!
Oh! It's Oniichan-senpai!
Calling you "Oniichan-senpai" is all the rage among the first-year girls, Mikadono-senpai!
Onii-chan, here you go!
Yes, it's been really busy all day.
You're right!
Yes!
O-Onee-chan, would you like some more tea?
What is it, Senpai?
You managed to save my cafe from failing.
If our chromosomes can come together,
We need to strike while the iron is hot, so let's start now...
Sorry, but could you help me look for it?
Sagara Mei.
It didn't ring.
But why would she go to the trouble of doing that?
I guess there's no point in playing dumb if you already know that much.
My mother said that we were almost like actual sisters.
Then...
But now's not the time.
No, he's going to have my lunch!
No, he's having my bread!
Oh? So you do even crazier things?
but my memories from back then are all fuzzy.
Collect the mucus from inside the cheek with this cotton swab.
You may also use blood, urine, or any other bodily fluids.
Yes.
By "mucus membrane," I meant inside your mouth...
There we go.
Shougo-san, are you really...
It's nothing perverted, I swear.
Pee maniac?
Pee?
Pee?
Hey!
What's all this commotion in the hallway?
The board of directors is coming today to inspect the school.
From what I hear, some of the directors are very interested in seeing you, as Mikadono Kumagorou's sole heir.
Sensei.
Yes.
It's me, your sister.
Is she threatening me?
Everything will be over if that happens.
Got it? You need to be careful of those around you.
But Sagara-senpai...
A special high-class disciplinary committee under the student council's direct command?
I think we can just keep things the way they are.
We, the student council, need to take action at times like this.
M-Mikadono-senpai, I look forward to working with you!
What do you mean?
I don't know either...
And when I think about my favorites being used by my friends, it feels like I'm being cuckolded.
Any other complaints?
Well, not really...
It's gonna be awesome! It's a scoop!
No secret photography in school!
No!
Isn't it obvious?
Fine.
If it's more than 10 cm above your knees, you're changing into your tracksuit.
I didn't!
Well, I...
Senpai, what do you think you're looking at?!
Dead bodies aren't really my thing.
Why don't you come with me, President Tendou? I'll treat you.
Stop staring at me!
Payback for the slime!
Nice!
Kunitachi-san, you okay?
But amusement parks aren't so bad, right?
Hey, Rinka-chan!
I just got the feeling I'd seen it somewhere before, so I...
Its tail.
Y-Yeah.
Kunitachi-san.
This.
I also found this phone with a built-in voice changer in this room.
You're saying that was me?
Yeah.
You must've seen the original. Am I right?
It's the first time I've heard that.
Kunitachi-san, I'm sorry.
You don't have to apologize.
It's my fault for being bound by my family and reputation, and being unable to turn down his wicked request.
Kunitachi-san.
Thanks to that, I was able to cancel my engagement without problems, and it looks like my father likes you.
All right, it's time for my sexy preview!
"A Sudden Attack! Be Wary of Sisters!"
What?!
Fine.
Hey, Shougo.
an8What was that commotion all about?!
Well, let's start making the necessary arrangements.
I guess it's tough being part of an elite family.
I'll have a soft ice cream while waiting for you.
This was the only rental swimsuit they had left.
I see why we had to change into swimsuits.
Nice!
Attention, guests.
A problem has been detected in this attraction's power systems,
But amusement parks aren't so bad, right?
Kunitachi-san.
Hello, Shougo-san?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Are you trying to say that I'm the culprit?
Didn't you buy that strap at the amusement park?
You almost certainly borrowed that cellphone from Tsuruma-senpai.
You must be referring to Mikadono Shougo-san.
And with the board of directors' inspection coming up,
Got it? You need to be careful of those around you.
Huh?
C-Calm down!
Well, everyone, it's time for the regular Shiga-san's Check!
Next up, we have Tsuruma-senpai's oral mucus membrane.
With just the inside of my mouth?
This bed's expensive, so stop knocking it!
Um, is something wrong?
That's right.
I will be sending you two invitations.
Take this!
It's these boobs that are being cheeky!
Yuzurina, why are you...
I was in the area and figured I should find out more about this school,
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's going on, Shougo-san?
Well, uh... um...
That's why I'd like you to keep what we'll be talking about inside this room.
I understand that, but... uh...
I apologize for the late introduction.
Onii-sama, you believe me, right?
That's what I think.
Am I wrong?
What's the problem?
That's why I'd like you to prepare another DNA test.
Understood.
Eating out every night is bad for your diet.
I told you there'd be dessert tonight.
He seems particularly close to those three.
Then there's Tendou Mana and Sagara Mei.
I can't take any more!
You just wouldn't eat my dessert.
Please eat it.
No, I just thought I saw someone.
You got that right!
I got really excited.
You're concerned about your friends?
Well, yeah.
We're finally here!
We'll show you to the ballroom.
These are pretty good.
Indeed.
It might be a good idea to look for her.
Yes, this should be enough to start a scandal regarding Kumagorou-sama.
She wouldn't...
I thought she was acting suspiciously lately, so I disguised myself and investigated her.
Thanks.
No, I'm not strong at all.
Huh?
You're right.
Let's get back to the party.
I'm sure Kannagi-san is waiting for you too.
Did you do something strange to her?
I see.
I see.
Then I'll help you with that.Then I'll make you mentally prepared.
I don't want you to go away!
I'll be by your side from now on.
The two of them must be very close.
I'd love to show it to you all next week.
Onii-sama!
But doing this sort of feels like we're newlyweds.
Or will you have me?
Onii-sama.
But you did say you were my sister...
I was told that she caught a cold or something.
So you've been investigating a lot of stuff?
Are you okay?
So what should we do afterwards?
Yes?
Are Marie Chocolate's puddings one of their specialties too?
Miyabi's room is on the third floor, right?
Yes?
If you won't...
Wow!
What about it?
Huh? On the day of Kumagorou-san's funeral?
an8Iizuka.
an8Here!
I... see...
I have practice now. We can go ahead if the captain says it's okay.
Guess I'll go home.
Wait, one second.
Those are for guests!
Wh-What is it, Mikadono-senpai?
You burst in without knockingRAEP
Just watch me swim.
There's one last place we need to go.
Oh?
Just the top is enough!
TEL
Oh? Are you two on a date?
See you at school tomorrow.
I-I didn't mean to eavesdrop...
Yuzurina, do you have some time to talk?
but that was because I wanted the best for you as your sister...
That's right!
You said you asked your foster parents to prepare them.
Danno Nayuri?
playing Perin-chan in Cyborg Soldier Grand Bellion.
Why would you do this?!
It took everything I had not to laugh.
O-ni-i-sa-ma.
Kannagi-san was...
Drowning?!
I can't let that happen!
Okay.
If I'm wrong, tell me.
After that, my dad changed hospitals, and I never saw you again.
That's why I knew right away that Houshou-san was lying when she said she was your sister.
But right after you thought you had found your sister, you started trying to date Tsuruma-san.
I told her that I knew she was a fake and asked her to reveal herself.
If the public finds out about the illegitimate child, it would not bode well for the Mikadono Group.
Could you let me borrow it for a while?
I thought that Houshou-san would get mad at me,
It felt like I was deceiving even Houshou-san.
There was no letter in the first place.
Am I right?
When I told her about what happened in the suite room, she said that I was just one step away from getting you.
So that's why she said she saw Konoe at the funeral that day.
So don't worry.
Oh, Kannagi-san...
I knew it!
Now that you've found your sister, you could make out with any girl you wanted.
TEL
I must fu... fulfill...
Don't mind the gravel on the floor.
In This Corner of the World
Then I got lost,
What? Oh, no...
Let me see.
I'm so distracted at times.
Thanks, our ancestors will appreciate it.
You look so pretty.
It's tough.
Wake up. The tide is pulling out.
So if I leave my kimono there,
You're so kind, Suzu.
Stupid!
February 1938
Oh.
I wish I could draw like you.
Umm...Mizuhara?
I don't want to go home.
Urano, give me your hand.
It's my brother's, I have plenty more.
If you want to draw, then draw this stupid ocean
But still better than the idiot who joined the Navy and drowned.
Kure?
Hurry home.
She should be home any minute.
Someone left a window open...
Thank you for having us.
Of course.
Oh, Suzu?
Have a nice day.
But Keiko found a job and a husband all on her own.
Welcome back.
What's that rag you're wearing?
Hello Harumi.
Hey, Mom!
and we brought someone like you to a place you don't know.
It's time for dinner.
My sister-in-law said
I haven't heard from him, though.
- What? - Good night!
I'm home.
Sure.
I see.
Here's a yellow one.
That ship is a submarine tender.
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Suzu, stress will only make you lose more hair.
You'll stain everything black.
Dandelions, dried sardines, and soy pulp.
Use extra water for thin rice porridge.
Boil pickled plum pits in water.
Don't worry. I'll find a job and work.
even with all that overtime.
The pillars and tatami mats from Keiko's house were a godsend.
So this is where you've been.
I see two Yamato ships.
I see.
That's the Tone. She has no rear turrets.
Yes.
Good.
That's how distracted I can be...
Sir. I was... just...
She was sketching shorelines and ships.
at the navy court-martial office.
After all, a daughter-in-law was a stranger before!
The laundry is still outside.
Acting humble made her look cunning and what not.
She's so clueless, she thought I work as a store clerk.
We thought putting it
That's fifty times the ration price!
Naganoki? The naval cemetery?
I'm sorry.
You're lost?
Even though you're a grown-up?
and everyone smells very nice.
Go straight and turn right when you pass the post office.
Good! Let's have a cold beer, then.
Let's go then.
I used the excuse that
Changing my name and moving was hard for me,
was the best decision of my life.
You're tanned even in winter.
She must be quite useless here.
What do you say?
Good night.
Okay.
That drawing of white rabbit waves...
Everyone loved that drawing, and I didn't know what to do.
Our family was poor, so he chose a tuition-free naval academy.
"Army Private First Class Yoichi Urano"
Could you sort out that argument at home?
I know.
Mr. Houjo?
I know you worked all night,
April 6th, 1945
May 5th, 1945
Engagement ongoing. 30 aircraft approaching from southeast.
My military uniform arrived.
This will take forever.
Is that so? The sooner the better.
Auxiliary minesweeper No.16.
I want to tell my brother which ships I saw here.
Need to find a public bomb shelter.
Come quickly.
Bad luck, huh?
Thank you very much.
Bracken-dumplings.
I lied.
Eighth squad, move!
Three are confirmed in the seas south of Ashizuri.
- Your training? - Cancelled.
I'm glad that you're alive.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Sumi, thanks for coming.
No, so it's strong.
I'm meeting him at the fire station.
You like him?
You must find it hard to be here not being able to do housework.
Oh, it fled from the beach.
You did what you were told.
The JOFK isn't coming in.
What is that cloud?
Chita, aren't you a nurse?
It's frustrating with one hand.
My son is a soldier in Hiroshima.
I said no!
Understood.
August 9th
So I gather them to use them as toilet paper.
They dropped those new bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Not to worry. Where's Shusaku?
Let's start eating.
No more bombs, so no more floating fish.
Thank you. Here is fine.
Keiko!
This one's flavorless.
I gave the Americans directions and they gave me chocolate.
The dead soldier found next to the settlement house was my son.
You lost Harumi in front of your eyes.
From now on, this body will be here to smile.
Sumi?
Don't get up. Are you ill?
I wish Yoichi could come back to Eba.
On the morning of the festival, Mom went shopping in the city.
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
Huh?
No, I can commute.
I'm buying treats for my brother and sister.
and I met an old man.
I have to go home before night fall or else...
You'll see soon enough.
Thanks, Suzu Urano!
I'll say "Our parents will join us later."
Excuse me...
Wait for your allowance.
Suzu, is Tetsu Mizuhara going to school every day?
Oh, the white waves look like rabbits hopping.
Oh, thanks...
Imperial Navy Forces conducting
Hurray! Hurray!
Where did you come from, Grandma?
Then he will ask, "Can I open it?"
Don't be silly!
We lost our way.
i"Yano"i
i"Koyaura"i
Someone left a window open...
Hello, Mrs. Kobayashi.
Simple suits our girl just fine.
Thank you for setting out the futons.
It's brand new.
Mrs. Houjo?
- I'm Chita. - I'm Kariya.
first you must timely counter and neutralize...
When Shusaku was in the fourth grade,
the "disarmament for peace"
Humdrum? How? Rice is such a luxury now!
So I stay quiet.
Oh, dear. What should I do?
Not again, not like that!
Put in a waistband and I'm done!
Can I have some string?
I'll go. Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
Thank you, I was able to fix my kimono.
I'm so tired.
Then my in-laws apologized
Uh, if that's what you want, isn't that nice?
- You too? - Nothing.
Maybe I did just tell you a Navy secret!
I feel bad for the Houjo family.
Mommy, can I borrow the ink?
What for?
I wanna use it.
No, I'm not.
That's right. Let's welcome them to Kure.
So you knew...
It's still better then just being given vegetable leafs,
Good job.
We have lots of rice today. The grains are so puffy.
I have plenty of firewood. My house was torn down.
There will be more of us now.
What a fine bomb shelter.
Sure, take it. Just be careful.
I see lots of warships, but no aircraft carriers.
She's an aircraft cruiser.
Shusaku!
So you like warships?
Yes.
Even for Keiko, that was hard on her.
That's Yamato.
at the navy court-martial office.
Has she sent coded transmissions?
I'm home.
It's so small, you won't be able to draw the shoreline.
Shusaku, you were lucky...
Dad's home! Let's tell him, too!
I'm sorry, Harumi.
We need to hide it from the ants.
Naganoki? The naval cemetery?
Watermelon?
Sure! I'll draw whatever you want.
Stop playing around so much.
Sorry, I have to go.
Ah, wonderful...
You'll embarrass Shusaku dressed like that!
How goes it with the GKF?
Let's go then.
Changing my name and moving was hard for me,
I don't want to wake up because I'm happy to be who I am today.
A real sailor!
We bumped into each other at the well.
"Bath shore leave" means free time,
She must be quite useless here.
I'll take her off your hands anytime!
What? I can't call you Urano anymore.
Suzu, come join me!
We came back from Manila with the wounded.
It looked like a heron, but I saw it in the South.
Back in Eba, they just stood in the river.
Wait. You haven't drawn in a while?
I'm sorry.
You idiot!
Air raid alarm all clear.
April 6th, 1945
You're small,
He's hurt but he'll be discharged soon.
Farther than Hiroshima?
Is this enemy's music?
So that's why Keiko was...
I want to tell my brother which ships I saw here.
Come quickly.
Your mommy is always with you.
Thank you very much.
Be careful.
A formation is northbound via Hiroshima Bay.
Please grab rice balls delivered from Hiroshima!
Suzu!
- Your training? - Cancelled.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I'm glad you're getting better.
Ouch.
This is horrible.
I'm sorry. I saw a white heron flying.
It's none of that!
Suzu, I really enjoyed these 18 months we've spent together.
Ouch.
What was that?
The wounded must stay.
Hiroshima helped us before, now it's our turn to help them.
Suzu, your family...
He walked all the way from Hiroshima.
So I gather them to use them as toilet paper.
I suppose.
Please, come in.
We lost the war?
Why?
There's five of us still here!
Not to worry. Where's Shusaku?
Goodbye.
No idea, but I'll take anything gladly.
Paper waste?
This one's flavorless.
You lost Harumi in front of your eyes.
iSuzu.i
I can't help with work outside on this cold bitter day.
The Navy was disbanded at the end of November.
That's right. This is Kure.
"Kure" means we are protected by nine mountains.
She should go in last.
Take a look. We're almost there.

an8Can't say it's all rosy.

Um...
i1That's how my brother explained it to me later.
I wonder what we should draw.
What?
Take it.
Even if it's just this boring ocean.keyframe. If not for the needed onscreen time this is better snapped.
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
My.
Kure?
I want you to have this. I fixed it up for the day you get married.
i1I guess I'm becoming an adult.
i1I think Kure is where there's a naval port that's full of sailors.
What? Mizuhara?Makes more sense that this is spoken out loud.
Hurry on home.
Oh, gosh!
Excuse me.MTBB: Pardon us.
We lost our way.
Someone left a window open.
Oh, Mrs. Kobayashi.
We've climbed so high up!
No one would be noisy at a wedding.
you can relax a little bit and have her take over.
I'm just glad you've got a mouth that works.Alt more literally: I'm just glad you can eat properly with your mouth.
You don't have to worry about that.
i1Everyone around here seems to work for the Navy.
Rationing duty?
are always going at it.
No I'm not.
Fine. Then I won't.The capitals should distinguish this from "Fine, then." Speed readers might see it differently.
Uh, so at the waist...
Put in a waistband and...
Can I have some string, Suzu?
I'll go instead.
What is it, dear?
Just the two of you?
Make yourself at home.
My pleasure.Alt: Not at all.
Come on, Suzu! Wake up already.
Oh gosh. I dreamt I married a man in Kure.
Yes.
If that's what you want, then good for you.Different conversation. She was more thinking about travels soon being restricted as Suzu's dad mentioned  33:03 ?
So, did you write to Yoichi?
Mommy, can I use the ink?
What for?
Come on, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
Yes. For tonight's supper.
Oh, here's a yellow one.
Those little ones are destroyers.
Look, some white-eyes are flying about.
Over there.
Uh, Suzu...
You know, Suzu, stressing over your bald spot will only make you lose more hair.
So you noticed.
I said no! You'll stain everything black.
i1Soon, Keiko left and went back to her late husband's family, so I thought,
Ah, I see.
Well, estimates of the enemy's range put only Kyushu in danger for now.
Don't fall now.
That's terrible.
I hope they can find a place to live.
an2What?
Really?
Oh, there's a small one headed this way.
Good.
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,
But Keiko, with her temper, didn't get along with his family.
He was taken to Shimonoseki.
That's the Yamato.MTBB: She's Yamato.

i1Am I the only one who doesn't find it funny?
Here, take this. Buy some at the black market.
i1With that secret stash mother gave me, and this month's budget, I only have 25 yen.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...
But anyway, you sure can draw.
Ah, this is what he wants.
They're quite laid back.
Oh, Suzu?
Suzu, choosing to marry you was the best decision of my life.
Wow, you're tanned even though it's winter.
Stop being so cocky!smug
Huh? What am I s'posed to call you, then?
Suzu, you can't hit a sailor.
What's so funny?
Here.
Thank you.
How's the Aoba?
Gonna cut it into a pen?
Well...
Really?Normally would join with previous but the pause is fairly long
Suzu, you're awful warm.keyframe. Snapping actually looks worse here even though it doesn't stop short of the dialogue.

You really are just a ordinary girl.normal
I'm sorry.
And when my brother died, I signed up to join the Navy.
They were just ordinary choices,
I'm relieved to see that you haven't changed a bit.that you're normal
Smile when you think of me.
You've become a real doll.
But Shusaku,
Hey, you two, do you really need to fight right now?
an2Like wallpaper,
So, what about the enemies horsepower...?I guess enemy is what a young child would say.
Father?
Air raid all clear!
Survival kits...
Where's Dad?
What?
I love you.This is the dub and is a much better translation. I think the strong dialect made the official sub translators change it to: 'I'm so fond of you.'
Dad asked me to repair his watch.link?
It's a good chance to visit the Kuromura family back in Shimonoseki tomorrow.
I'll get the tickets. Can you take Harumi to see Dad?
This sure isn't like you!Alt more literally: Why're you all timid? 'quiet' would work better if I went with this. Official: Don't worry.
Is Shimonoseki far?
I've been unconscious.
I hear it's June already.
Which means
an8i1Roughly 20 large aircraft, heading to Kure.
Of course. Quickly.
Sure! Thank you for your hard work!She can't really hear him
Will you draw my brother sometime?
How could you let this happen?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Keiko.
Don't push yourself.Official: Don't strain yourself.
Are those flares?
Is City Hall still standing?
Yes. Go ahead.
i1I'm glad you're recovering so quickly.
i1The right hand that held Harumi's hand in June.
i1The right hand that held Teru's lip balm in April.
A nice army officer gave me a lift on the relief truck.
You sure you're okay?
I'm supposed to meet him in front of the fire station.'at the fire station.' Nothing wrong with the more literal
It's so sad that Kure keeps being targeted.More literally: It's so sad that Kure has been bombed so many times.
Over the mountain, to Hiroshima!
I loved walking with you and listening to you talk.
Oh, right. I guess this isn't going in our wash.
I've fixed up that pure cotton outfit your sister brought.those pure cotton slackswork pants
I can't see my children anymore.
You were brought here to marry into a family you didn't know.Alt: into a family as an outsider; into a family you knew nothing about.
The other stations?
Come over here and look at this!
Suzu, I'm sure your family...
The navy base sent a relief party.
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo.
We can't let people use our toilet for a while, then.
But not all of it.
We still have tomorrow and the day after that.
i1October, November and next year.
i1A year later, ten years later.
Let's just start eating.
I couldn't recognize my own son.
Yes...
i1Suzu.
i1Harumi. I can see the ship now.
Oh, if only I had my hand, I'd draw My Ogre Brother's Adventures in the South Seas.
You will. It just wouldn't be right if you didn't.
Shusaku, thank you for finding me in this corner of the world.
I...
It is usually my brother's job, but he has a cold.
So... I must fulfill... his...
Ain't you the polite one! No need, no need.
What?!
Oh, me too, me too.
Thanks, Urano Suzu!
We...
i1There are ups and downs...
Would you like some more?
i1That's how my brother explained it to me later.
Wait for your allowance.
You're cold!
Mizuhara, you won't be able to go home until you finish drawing.
I won't draw it.
The white waves look like rabbits hopping.
No thanks.
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
I came from Furue.
Because you must.
I thought you were the suitor!
I just came home for my brother's memorial!
The guy ain't someone you know?
But, uh, it wasn't easy to find your house.
i1I don't know if I should marry him or not.
It's this way.
They're here!
Oh no!
You were though!
Sorry you have to do that.
It's brand new.
I just swallowed the entire fruit.
i1Everyone around here seems to work for the Navy.
Mrs. Houjo!
Ah, yes?
I'm just measuring it.
You're eyeballing it!
Those were the days.
It's for me and my daughter, okay?!
Fine. Then I won't.The capitals should distinguish this from "Fine, then." Speed readers might see it differently.
Uh, so at the waist...
Put them together... and sew.
Suzu, are you going to town?
Um, Keiko...
and we brought someone like you to a place you know nothing about.
It would've been better if I just stayed here all along.
Suzu, why don't you go home to Hiroshima?
That'd be for the best.
Y-Yes!
Oh gosh. I dreamt I married a man in Kure.
How's the volunteer corps?
I think I might've just unearthed a Navy secret.Referring to Suzu's bald spot.
Sure.
Come on, please!
Are they different in Eba?
I was wondering why you were so gloomy of late.
You're homesick, huh?
I can see.
i1Violet.
i1Let it sit overnight.
Well, estimates of the enemy's range put only Kyushu in danger for now.
I heard shots on Mt. Haigamine yesterday.keyframe
All right!
All right...More literally: Hup; Upsy-daisy. Neither fits well as he says this before picking those shovels up.
Oh, there's a small one headed this way.
You see that big cloud?
Okay.
It causes heavy rain.
Yeah, Hi-bo loves battleships.
We can go back in the house, now that it's only drizzling.
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,
That's where they met.
Hisao is the heir of the Kuromura family.
He was taken to Shimonoseki.
It's so hot...
I'm okay.
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
i1What?
Are you also from South Hiroshima?
What? You don't know?
What if I bump into him?MTBB: I don't know what I'll do if I see him.
Mind your manners, Harumi.
Huh? What am I s'posed to call you, then?
It's nothing special.
I asked him to sleep in the shed.
There.
It looked like a heron, but I was way down south when I came across her.Alt: I took it from a heron, even though I was in the southern seas when I saw it.
Back in Eba, they just stood in the river year-round.
I can't quite get it right.Alt: I can't quite draw it like I want. MTBB: put it down on paper.
You forgot?
Our teacher entered it into a contest.
Yep.
I thought you were forced to get married and needed help.
And when my brother died, I signed up to join the Navy.
It was so tiny that Sumi thought...
Huh?
I should've guessed Yoichi wouldn't die that easy.
Shusaku.
It's nothing.
And yet you've never once shown me your angry face.
Really? School isn't scary?
Well, uh...
Air raid alert! Air raid alert!
Ready air raid gear! attire
Oops! Sorry!
You're so small, Suzu.
Suzu...
Will you remember me now?
Oh!Huh?
Yep.Alt: That's right.
We can't see anything.
We've had so many false alarms.
Look.
Okay.I guess
Watch out, Harumi!
i1I should've run barefoot.
i1She resembles Shusaku so much.
You were there with her.keyframe
Murderer.
Give her back!
She didn't mean what she said.
Well, if it gets too tiring at work, I'll just take a break there.
i1This is JOFK, Hiroshima Broadcasting.
Mind if I use these?
You're hurt.
Your training?
i1I'm glad you're recovering so quickly.
i1The right hand that held my brother's brain in February.
i1The right hand that drew many rabbits seven years ago.
He even remembered that I have an older sister who got married and moved to Kure.MTBB: 'I was able to come today because he remembered that I have a sister who moved to Kure.' I guess the first part here is implied but it's not in JP dialogue itself. Deviates too much from the JP for me.
i1This isn't the place for you right now.
Are you trying to die?
It must've come from the waterfront.
going home to Hiroshima.
Or is it Harumi?
Say something!
You were brought here to marry into a family you didn't know.Alt: into a family as an outsider; into a family you knew nothing about.
Nothing. The JOFK isn't coming in.
Can I come too?
I said no!
The navy base sent a relief party.
But...
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo.
I can hardly look at the poor girl in the eye. I feel so bad.so sorry
Sorry!
I missed all of them.
We can't let people use our toilet for a while, then.
Not to worry.
Not home yet.
No more bombs so no more floating fish.
I remember that time, yes.
It's so quiet.
Oh, Suzu. Do you know what this line is for?
It's all right.
i1Suzu.
i1Suzu.
I wish he could come back to Eba.Yoichi
Suzu, look at me.
Will I get better?
You will. It just wouldn't be right if you didn't.
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
I...
Huh?What sounds a bit strong to me
She's covered in lice!
We should start with a bath.
I am delivering seaweed to Futaba in Nakajima Honmachi.
It is usually my brother's job, but he has a cold.
Suzu-chan,
What?!
And I gotta ride the train back home with my dad.
Thanks, Urano Suzu!
i1The waves were wild just last night,
i1Mom and Dad joined us after shopping, and we visited our family grave.
What?! You left your kimono in Kusatsu?
Take it.
It was my brother's.
He's got plenty more.
But still,
You're staying near, Sumi-neechan.
There's no adventure in marrying close to home.
On your wedding night, he'll ask, Did you bring an umbrella?
i1I think Kure is where there's a naval port that's full of sailors.
Never met him.
She'll be home any minute.
Now what should I do?
Thank you for having us today, Kobayashi-san.
I'm glad the weather is nice.
We've climbed so high up!
This is quite the feast!
Father, Mother, it's an honor to be part of your family.
Oh, right! She's my sister-in-law who's already married!Official: 'Right! She's the daughter who got married.' Arguably more natural but the more literal sounds fine
i1Where have I ended up?
Thank you for setting the futon.
I just swallowed the entire fruit.
Excuse me...
Haha, I'm young, don't worry!? not sure about this interjection but can't think of anything better
Oops!
Scoot closer, will you?
Okay.
We thought those times were tough.
It's for me and my daughter, okay?!
Mom, listen to this!
Not again! Another mistake.Alt: There you go again! That's all wrong. See lines  1:26:08  keyframe
Put in a waistband and...
Can I have some string, Suzu-san?
Keiko, Harumi, you're here.
What?
Welcome home.
Oh, it's eight already.
So, did you write to Yoichi?
Oh my!
How about you?
You're getting a bald spot.
i1Goodbye, Hiroshima.
What?
Suzu-san?
Okay then, thank you for your time.
You're homesick, huh?
There's a U-boat from Germany.
Oh.
About 2,700 people.
I-I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
You know, Suzu-san, stressing over your bald spot will only make you lose more hair.
Oh, so Kariya-san taught you this recipe?
The grains are swollen.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing on the radio.
Don't fall now.
They need to build firebreaks throughout the city.
I hope they can find a place to live.
an2What?
All right!
Shusaku-san, can I have some of this dirt for the fields?
Made it.Alt's: Hup; And, hup; Up I get.
Yeah, Onii-san taught me.Onii-san. This is where using these titles works but otherwise, what to do? MTBB went with "he" but it's too out of place.
Ahh! Shusaku-san!
I can do it. I can do it.
Oh...
We can go back in the house, now that it's only drizzling.
I guess he was way too skinny.
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,
I'm home.
Eat up!
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
i1Wow, they have everything here.
Huh?! That's fifty times the ration price!
i1Where the heck am I?
Even though you're grown up?
Wait here.
Ah, wonderful...
Huh? What's the matter? Don't tell me you really aren't feeling well.
I don't want you seeing this silly grin on my face!
Changing my name and moving was hard for me.
I suppose I haven't had much of an appetite lately.
i1Ready port entry. Slow ahead. Reduce 2 knots.
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, an Aoba crewmember.
Isn't Aoba a Class A cruiser?
Mind your manners, Harumi.
Bath shore leave just means free time.
It's nothing special.
Here. I tossed some coals in the bed warmer. Take it to him.Official: I've readied the bed warmer. Take it to him.
Come on, we have lots to catch up on.
Here. A souvenir for ya.
Gonna cut it into a pen?

i1Never seen that before.
It's wrapped up there.
But you'll be okay, Suzu-san.
Oh!Huh?
Your uniform looks so cool!
For the Houjo-sans.
They'd only have you doing exercises and playing in the dirt.
This sure isn't like you!Alt more literally: Why're you all timid? 'quiet' would work better if I went with this. Official: Don't worry.

Hmm, I wonder if we can see anything.
Oh dear, so they're really coming this time.
Evacuate! Run!
Suzu-san, I'm scared.
We'll be okay.
Excuse me. Can we have some water?
Will you draw my brother sometime?
i1She warned me so many times, but somehow I was okay.
i1Over the hill...

Oh please, Suzu-chan!Stop that!
This is horrible.
It's so sad that Kure keeps being targeted.More literally: It's so sad that Kure has been bombed so many times.
Hey Suzu-chan, why don't you come home to Hiroshima?
I loved walking with you and listening to you talk.
i10731 hours, Hiroshima Prefecture.
That's the spot.
My word. What a hot morning.
I'm sorry I blamed you for Harumi's death.
Could it be lightning in this weather?

So what're you going to do with all these sandals?
Thank you.
Okay.
We'll never give in to violence.MTBB: We won't buckle under your savagery. Official: We'll never surrender to violence.
Please let me stay.

Where are you off to?
A monster.

You and your ways.
I must point out that the probability is extremely high.Could add: the probability of air raids... Not in the JP but implied. This is kind of cutting into his speech midway so he was probably talking about air raids just prior.

She wore that on her dates with her husband.
How I miss those days now.

It's for me and my daughter, okay?!

My sister-in-law said I could go back to Hiroshima.
Oh, to visit family!Different conversation

Sure, no problem!
Mint candy and bracken-starch dumplings!warabi-mochi

Oh, Suzu?
I guess a big ship is back in port.
Sailors do need their time off. hand over; surrender to. Translating the idea otherwise this line makes little sense.

I'm supposed to meet him in front of the fire station.'at the fire station.' Nothing wrong with the more literal
Oh please, Suzu-chan!Stop that!
Maybe I will if your officer friend turns out to be quite the handsome one.Alt more literally: It all depends on whether your officer friend is handsome or not.
Ow, that's hot!
i1Yes, it's all of those things.
I loved walking with you and listening to you talk.
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you! I can't hear you!
I can't see my children anymore.
You're welcome to stay here or go anywhere you choose.
I did!
Then you can join us tomorrow.
Oh no.
Stay strong, okay?
And by the way, Urano Juro, Kiseno and Sumi are from Eba.
i1I want to stay strong.
Oh, please come in.
I thought we were fighting to the last man!Official: They said we would fight to the end!
I've still have my left arm and both my legs!left hand. MTBB: I've still got one working arm and two working legs!
Let's enjoy white rice tonight.
i1A year later, ten years later.
i1Ah, it's at times like this...
This city sure has changed.Alt: But talk about a changed city. MTBB: Look at this city now.
i1Suzu.
an2It's a waste of salt.
Oh, Suzu-chan! You cut your hair.
He grows a beard and marries a crocodile.
I'm glad I found a job in Hiroshima.Plenty of onscreen time to read this so cutting it at the keyframe.
Huh?What sounds a bit strong to me
It might be good for your mom and Sumi-san.
And in the center is Mt. Haigamine.
She's covered in lice!
Where are you off to?
Hello?
i1Half box, 5 sen.
He's a kidnapper and we're being kidnapped.
Oh, me too, me too.
Or else what?
i1so I was probably daydreaming that day, too.
Um...
Grandma!
You're cold!
Yeah...
What?
The white waves look like rabbits hopping.
Mizuhara-san, you can have my brother if you want.
I am?
Says Urano Sumi, as she shifts her grip on her chopsticks.
You'll answer, I brought a brand new one.
B-But why?
We lost the seaweed business to land reclamation three years ago.
Okay.
i1But I wonder, why did I taste caramel in my mouth?
It's so cold.
Which way is the station?
Thank you.
I'll be your matchmaker for today.
Don't disrobe here!
Would you just look at all this!
This stew is delicious.
See you when you come home to visit!
I'll see you then!
I'll see you around.
I also remember that beauty mark of yours.
Excuse me...
What might be the street name and number of this house?More literal since the dub does the same. Even more literally: 'What is the block and number of this place in Kure?' Official sub: What might be the address of this house?
We're off.
Ah, yes?
I'm just measuring it.
It's gonna fall!
Ouch...
Those were the days.
What brings you home, Keiko?
Oops.Realising she needs to collect the daily food rations
Stop. I'll do it.
What is it, dear?
Welcome home, dad.
Make yourself at home.
My pleasure.Alt: Not at all.
It would've been better if I just stayed here all along.
That's quite a pile.
Okay.
Come on, Suzu! Wake up already.
Are you awake now?
My sister-in-law said I could go back to Hiroshima.
I did.Alt: Me? Yes, I did.
I haven't heard from him, though.
And he doesn't write much.
But it's not as cold as harvesting seaweed, so there are good things about it.
Uh, I don't know yet. There's so much to learn.
W-What is it?
Yeah?
Come on, please!
What?
Those little ones are destroyers.
Over there.
Uh, Suzu-san...
Ah, I see.
i1First:
i1Add miso and violets to yesterday's sardine stew.
It needs to fit a few more people.Alt: There will be more of us in there now, so...
Well, thanks again.
Okay, let's clean up out here.
I'm amazed. You know so much.
You really like your battleships, huh?
Huh?Omit. Lead in quite long but works ok. Still very short
Yeah, Hi-bo loves battleships.
You'll meet him one day.
It's nice that you get along.
Nee-chan went to buy a watch for him.The only good replacement for Nee-chan here is "Keiko".
As you'd expect, that was hard on her.
That's the Yamato.MTBB: She's Yamato.
Does this woman live here?
can you draw me sometime?
i1Am I the only one who doesn't find it funny?
I was just looking at the ants.
Sugar's so scarce right now!
Oh, that's Nagasako.
Yeah.
Nee-san, I have a question.Nee-san
Huh?
We've still got time. Let's take a walk.
Sailors do need their time off. hand over; surrender to. Translating the idea otherwise this line makes little sense.
But I am a little worried that you've lost weight.
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, an Aoba crewmember.
Back home, she weren't good for much but drawing and making seaweed.
You. You're so ordinary.normal
I'm gonna be a sailor when I grow up.
You know, Shusaku-san, getting left behind by those who've died...Alt: lagging behind all those who've already bitten the dustbullet... Official: Feeling left behind, alive, while others have already died...
It's cold so come 'n warm your feet.
It caused a heap of trouble.
You forgot?
and sweet.
Mizuhara-san...
You still get angry and sorry about ordinary things.
All good, then.
And when my brother died, I signed up to join the Navy.
...and was all puzzled about it.
doesn't marriage mean more to you?Onscreen time?
Oh yeah?
an2Like wallpaper,
Really? School isn't scary?
Harumi-chan!
i1If only I had some paint with me now.
an8Huh?
A unified determination and goal...
So, what about the enemies horsepower...?I guess enemy is what a young child would say.
Put out all fires!
You're so small, Suzu-san.
What?
But you'll be okay, Suzu-san.
Take care.
Huh?
All right. Let's go, Harumi-chan.
I hear it's June already.
I'm just glad you're alive.
Auxiliary Minesweeper No. 16.
an8i1Roughly 20 large aircraft, heading to Kure.
Excuse me, could you let us in?
We came from Naganoki to visit the hospital.
It's coming! Cover your ears and open your mouth or else your eyes will pop out!
It's so hot...
Sure! Thank you for your hard work!She can't really hear him
Will you draw my brother sometime?
How could you let this happen?
I'm sorry.
Give her back!
I think I'll hang the bandages out to dry.
Okay. Let's do it.
Mind if I use these?
Your training?
Suzu-san!
i1The right hand that held Teru-san's lip balm in April.
It's so sad that Kure keeps being targeted.More literally: It's so sad that Kure has been bombed so many times.
i1Don't come here.
Or is it Harumi?
Say something!
i10731 hours, Hiroshima Prefecture.
My word. What a hot morning.
So? When's your appointment?
With the doctor.
Don't look!
You'll never make it, anyway.
Not like you could buy train tickets, anyway.keyframe
But my choices have led me here.
And please, would you let me stay?
Cloud?
Uh-huh.
But...
But we couldn't tell who he was.
They knew what we were getting into, didn't they?
No more bombs so no more floating fish.
Yes...
It was awful.
Suzu-chan!
Oh, if only I had my hand, I'd draw My Ogre Brother's Adventures in the South Seas.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.
We'll keep changing and growing, this city and us.
On your right is Mt. Yasumi.
To the left is Mt. Hachimaki.
I have to feed the chickens before it gets dark.
And I gotta ride the train back home with my dad.
Ouch!
What? How do you know my name?
Would you like some more?
if I leave my kimono, she'll come and take that, too?
'Kay.
I lost my pencil.
I wish I could draw like you, Suzu.
I'm home.
What?
It was my brother's.
Even if it's just this boring ocean.keyframe. If not for the needed onscreen time this is better snapped.
Hey, you're right, they do look like white rabbits.
We'll have lunch when you're ready.
You're going far away to get married, Suzu.neechan. Maybe: Cousin Suzu ?
Nineteen. Well, actually, eighteen.
The wedding will be at the groom's house, right?
Your ma was so shocked
So I guess my son took a shine to your daughter on his way to school.
Yes?
i1How did this all happen so quickly?
My apologies for such a simple wedding.
Suzu, no!Hey, Suzu!  Oy Suzu!
Would you just look at all this!
No one would be noisy at a wedding.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I did.

We thought those times were tough.
Uh, so at the waist...
Suzu, are you going to town?
Yes, to get rations.
Welcome home.
I'm coming.
O-Ouch...
Here, it's time for dinner.
So, did you write to Yoichi?
It must be a dangerous job.
Uh, I don't know yet. There's so much to learn.
What? You're leaving, too?
Come on, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
They're aircraft carriers.
I want to paint Suzu's head.
i1Violet.
i1Let it sit overnight.
I'm sorry.
That's for sure.
No need to run to the mountains yet.
They need to build firebreaks throughout the city.
Oh...
Don't worry. I'll find myself a job and start working.go to work; get working
Yeah.Apprehensive to use this since I've gone with the formal 'Yes' so far but it is just an interjection. Alt: Uh-huh.
Things are getting rough.Official: Things are getting more precarious.
Yeah.
All right...More literally: Hup; Upsy-daisy. Neither fits well as he says this before picking those shovels up.
Ah, there's a lot of ships today.
Really?
That's a destroyer.
Is it...
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,
That's the Yamato.MTBB: She's Yamato.
She was sketching shorelines and ships.
We will not arrest her today, but keep a close eye on her.
I'm home.
can you draw me sometime?
We thought putting it in the water would keep the ants away from it.
i1And three pairs of socks might cost 1,000 yen.
Madam, I have a question.Madam
Near the ocean?
I met a kind person once,
And ice cream with wafers on top.

Talking about desserts for the first time in ages, somehow makes even water taste sweet.Alt: 'All this talk about desserts has made even this water taste sweet.'

The simple, official version: 'Thinking about desserts makes water taste sweet.'
Ah, this is what he wants.
Well then, let's go.
Just say hi like you normally would.
They're like dreams we woke up from.
We bumped into each other at the well.
Mind your manners, Harumi.
This is heaven.

Okay.
Really?
Gonna cut it into a pen?
It works.Literally: It writes.
It looked like a heron, but I was way down south when I came across her.Alt: I took it from a heron, even though I was in the southern seas when I saw it.
They all thought I'd made it, when the real artist
You still get angry and sorry about ordinary things.
I thought you were forced to get married and needed help.
I'm relieved to see that you haven't changed a bit.that you're normal

I'm the one who forced you to marry me.
What are you doing?
A unified determination and goal...
Air raid all clear!
I know you worked all night and it's been warm,sunny
Put out all fires!
She lost her husband in the war.
Ouch!
i1Damage to Hiro Naval Arsenal and Air Arsenal No. 11 was very limited.
You're so small, Suzu.
From the 15th, I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
I think so.
Oh!Huh?
Dad asked me to repair his watch.link?
Yep.Alt: That's right.
Is this the enemy's music?keyframe
Is that so? Well, the sooner the better.
Oh, no. What should we do? No time to make it back home.Translating the idea
We need to find a public bomb shelter.
Uh-huh. And who's this?
Okay.I guess
i1She warned me so many times, but somehow I was okay.
i1I held my bag with my left hand.
i1If only I had it the other way around.
i1Over the hill...
I'm so sorry, Harumi.
Stop, Keiko.
She didn't mean what she said.
We're glad that we got you back alive, at least.

This house made it through, huh?
I'm okay.
Suzu, what are you doing?
i1an8Chugoku region air raid information.

i1Boy, I'm glad it was a dud.

Oh please, Suzu!Stop that!
Ouch.
Thanks, Sumi.
My word. What a hot morning.
So? When's your appointment?
Here.
You'll never make it, anyway.
I added elastic straps so you can put it on yourself.
It's okay.
You just did what you were told.
so now it's our turn to..."While Kure was being bombed" is not natural for a local.
And by the way, Juro Urano, Kiseno and Sumi are from Eba.
I'm sorry.
Oh, please come in.
Why?
I tucked this away for our last meal.
But not all of it.
We still have tomorrow and the day after that.
You sure about this? You're trading away so many clothes.
And you lost Harumi in front of your eyes.
I suppose you must rest easy for now.
Oh, if only I had my hand, I'd draw My Ogre Brother's Adventures in the South Seas.
I'm sorry.
You will. It just wouldn't be right if you didn't.
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
I've been let go.
I...
I'll start the fire.for the bath
That's no good.
I have to feed the chickens before it gets dark.

Why, thank you! Let's take some along as an offering.

They say a girl who hold their chopsticks at the ends wed far away.
Where did you come from, Grandma?
That's just one village over.Furue is just next door from Kusatsu.
Suzu-chan, you need to go straight home!
Thank you.
The guy ain't someone you know?
So I guess my son took a shine to your daughter on his way to school.
I'm glad the weather is nice.
Simple is best for my daughter.
No one would be noisy at a wedding.
See you when you come home to visit!
I'll see you then!

so I'm counting on you, Suzu-san.
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
We're off.

I'm so sorry.
They'd go to the cinema, fancy restaurants and exhibits.
I was expecting you to be one of those sophisticated city girls from Hiroshima.
My, if it isn't Harumi-chan. Welcome, dear.
an8I'm sorry, this is all I've got.
Mom, listen to this!
I'm done!
I'm Kuromura Harumi.
I'm Houjo Suzu. Nice to meet you.
Can I have some string, Suzu-san?
Yes, to get rations.
Whew! I'm exhausted.
I think I just accidentally learned some Army secret!
Suzu-chan?
Well, it's time for me to head to the women's association.
i1Dad gave me an allowance.
Suzu-san?
Okay then, thank you for your time.
They're aircraft carriers.
Uh, Suzu-san...
Yes.
All right! Let's eat.
We're off.
Yes.
Well, estimates of the enemy's range put only Kyushu in danger for now.
They're tearing houses down, now.
Yeah.
Ah, there's a lot of ships today.
Really?
this Hisao here?lead in works ok since it's a connected sentence.
Good.
i1It took months for me to learn that about her.

Eat up!

We strive to improve our skills.
So, what about the enemies horsepower...?I guess enemy is what a young child would say.
Father?
but how could you fall asleep in the middle of a bombing?literally: air raid. Bombing does sound more natural here
It'll be big if you just draw it bigger.
I can't see anything.
Ouch!
Oh.I see.
That's impossible!
Hey, what ship did you ride?
Auxiliary Minesweeper No. 16.
The Hiro Naval Arsenal was closed down,
Huh?Normally wouldn't go with such a short line but it's better than omitting or as a single line with previous
It's so hot...
Hang on.
i1Over the hill...
i1That's the Tone and that's the Hyuga.
Stop, Keiko.
She's not herself right now.
That it did. Don't you worry.
Suzu-san, what are you doing?
i1I'm glad you're recovering so quickly.
A nice army officer gave me a lift on the relief truck.
The army officer showed it to me when I first arrived.
Hey Suzu-chan, why don't you come home to Hiroshima?
That's right! Fly as far away as you can!That way!
It must've come from the waterfront.
For good?MTBB translating the idea is better. More literally: You're not going to come backreturn?
I can't hear you! I can't hear you!
Oh, right. I guess this isn't going in our wash.
Here.
You were brought here to marry into a family you didn't know.Alt: into a family as an outsider; into a family you knew nothing about.
Um, now that I think about it,Official: I've changed my mind...

Silly girl. I'll trim your hair when we get home.Alt: Being silly again...

Unbelievable.
It goes in the storage.
They'd go to the cinema, fancy restaurants and exhibits.
She was a real modern lady, wasn't she?
Those were the days.
Are you roasting beans?
Also, that rice isn't a gift.
I'll go instead.
Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
What should we do for soup?
Just the two of you?
Excuse me, Shusaku?
It would've been better if I just stayed here all along.
Yes.
They all told me to relax for a couple of days.Onee-san and the rest.
But it's not as cold as harvesting seaweed, so there are good things about it.
A handsome young officer slips me his meal tickets.
Uh, I don't know yet. There's so much to learn.

Please, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
Come on, please!
I said no!
Picking herbs?
Oh, here's a yellow one.
There's a U-boat from Germany.

Yeah.Apprehensive to use this since I've gone with the formal 'Yes' so far but it is just an interjection. Alt: Uh-huh.
The pillars and tatami mats from Nee-chan's house were a godsend.
Shusaku, did you place this here?
Oh that. It was nothing.
Ah, there's a lot of ships today.
i1I can't believe I'm here, doing this with him.
I guess he was way too skinny.
Nee-chan went to buy a watch for him.The only good replacement for Nee-chan here is "Keiko".
When her husband died, they fought over the business.
Hisao is the heir of the Kuromura family.
She was sketching shorelines and ships.
After all, a daughter-in-law is still a stranger!
What's going on? The laundry is still outside.
Suzu-san involved in espionage, huh?
We thought putting it in the water would keep the ants away from it.

You're pale as a ghost. Are you okay?
Huh? What about work?
There's no rush. I just used the notebook as an excuse to get you down here.'to get you down here' not in the JP; added by the official translators so this makes more sense.
Sailors do need their time off. hand over; surrender to. Translating the idea otherwise this line makes little sense.
Just say hi like you normally would.
And I've made friends.
Suzu-san, choosing to marry you was the best decision of my life.
Wow, a real sailor!
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, an Aoba crewmember.

I thought we were fighting to the last man!Official: They said we would fight to the end!
We still have tomorrow and the day after that.
i1September.
Thank heavens for the salty seas!
The Navy was disbanded at the end of November.
Suzu-san, this is the bridge where I first met you.
I'll find that beauty mark and know it's you right away.MTBB: That beauty mark is a dead giveaway.
Huh?What sounds a bit strong to me
We could leave Kure and start over here.More literally: We could leave home and start a family here.
I think it's best that she go in last.
Hey!
It is usually my brother's job, but he has a cold.
Ain't you the polite one! No need, no need.
Take a look. We're almost there.
i1Half box, 5 sen.
an8Thank you for coming. Take care.
what's that thing?
Then I fell into his basket and met a boy there.
Thanks, Suzu Urano!
an8How's life over in Eba?
an8...rats, in the middle of the day?
i1That's how my brother explained it to me later.
I lost my pencil.
Suzu, does Tetsu Mizuhara come to school every day?
an2So short!
But still,
And with a drawing like this,
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
My.
You're staying near, Sumi.
Where did you come from, Grandma?
That's just one village over.Furue is just next door from Kusatsu.
A boy's come all the way from Kure looking for your hand in marriage.
Suzu, come here a minute.
What? Mizuhara?Makes more sense that this is spoken out loud.
I wouldn't say that.
i1But I wonder, why did I taste caramel in my mouth?
Thank you.
My apologies for such a simple wedding.
Suzu.
Suzu, no!Hey, Suzu!  Oy Suzu!
What's wrong? Is yours not ripe?
With my mouth.
We have. Don't you remember?keyframe
What is?
They'd go to the cinema, fancy restaurants and exhibits.
When Shusaku was in the fourth grade,
Oh, hello.
I'm talking about you!
Is that so?
Also, that rice isn't a gift.
Ouch!
I'm done!
Yes, to get rations.
Welcome home, dad.
Come on, Suzu! Wake up already.
And he doesn't write much.
Come on, I wanna use it.Alt: Come on, let me use it.
What?
There's a U-boat from Germany.
Is that a ship?
There's people on it, too?
i1It's still better then just being given vegetable leafs,
i1And moving on...
i1First:
Let's eat.
ls Shusaku off to work already?
If you need firewood, I have plenty.
Don't worry. I'll find myself a job and start working.go to work; get working
The pillars and tatami mats from Keiko's house were a godsend.
Sure, take it.
Yep. I'm looking at ships.
Yeah, Big Brother taught me.What to do???
It causes heavy rain.
Ahh! Shusaku!
For the moment, just take whatever you can into the shelter!Alt: whatever's around you more literal, less natural
You really like your battleships, huh?
Isn't that nice? Two married couples getting along so well.Alt: getting along so splendidly.
They used to measure their heights together as one happy family.
Wait, was Keiko's husband...
I guess he was way too skinny.
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,
That's the Yamato.MTBB: She's Yamato.
After all, a daughter-in-law is still a stranger!
the military police investigated Suzu, and...
i1Wow, they have everything here.
Sugar's 20 yen a pound.
i1A box of caramel could cost more than 100 yen.
i1What?
You lost?
Most of us aren't locals, and we don't go beyond these gates.literally: won't leave Official: Most of us aren't locals and we stay within these gates.
Not heard of 'em?
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Suzu?
D-Do I really look that funny?
I wanted to take you to the cinema, but...
I suppose I haven't had much appetite lately.
i1Ready port entry. Slow ahead. Reduce 2 knots.
Mind your manners, Harumi.
Stop being so cocky!smug
Huh? What am I s'posed to call you, then?
Hey! Suzu, wanna join me?
Oh, I think it's in the shelter.MTBB: 'In the shelter, if I remember right.' It's ok but a bit unnatural
Good night.
Ahh, there's nothing like being on dry land.
Okay.
Wait, don't tell me...Literally: possibly; could it be
Well...
You sure you don't want me to take you back home?Official: 'Do you want to stay?' What's wrong with the more literal version?
He'd be the same age as my late brother.
but somewhere along the way, I guess my life derailed from the ordinary.
Oh yeah?
an2going on forever.
Father?
I was so scared.Alt: You nearly gave meI nearly had a heart attack.
Air raid alert! Air raid alert!
It's still raw...
Remove sliding doors!
Nothing.
Oh!Huh?
Let me see. How handsome do I look?Alt: Did you make me handsome?
The house suddenly feels so much bigger.
For the Houjos.
No wonder we couldn't find him.
but he'll be discharged soon.
It's a good chance to visit the Kuromura family back in Shimonoseki tomorrow.
Where my brother is?
I'll get ready.
What about school?
Aw...
I'm just glad you're alive.
Auxiliary Minesweeper No. 16.
The Yamato?
Hang on.
i1She resembles Shusaku so much.
That it did. Don't you worry.
i1This is JOFK, Hiroshima Broadcasting.
Yes. Go ahead.
Hey! Anyone here from Shinonome?
I see.
Wow!
You sure you're okay?
Suzu, come on!
You're wrong!
Oh, ahhhh...keyframe  MTBB: Ooooohhhh, boy.
Oh, about 10 o'clock.
You need to change.
Excuse me, um...
Don't look!
I added elastic straps so you can put it on yourself.
I'm sorry I blamed you for Harumi's death.
Come over here and look at this!
i1Look at that big cloud. It's an anvil cloud.
The wounded must stay.
When we we're being bombed, Hiroshima helped us out,"While Kure was being bombed" is not natural for a local.
I hear it was a new type of bomb.More literally, add: 'that was dropped on Hiroshima.' Makes sense to omit this.
i1Kind but strong.
Ah, this rubbish again.Idea translation. Literally: so loud
I'm sorry.
I missed all of them.
That's true enough.
We can't let people use our toilet for a while, then.
Why?
They knew what we were getting into, didn't they?
I tucked this away for our last meal.
i1A year later, ten years later.
We only have rice.Alt: There's nothing else though.
Let's just start eating.
I'll be back! I'll come home to you, got it?
Oh, Suzu. Do you know what this line is for?
No idea, but I'll take anything right now since we're short on everything.
I gave the Americans directions, and they gave me chocolate.
You sure about this? You're trading away so many clothes.
Didn't you hear?
Yes...
i1Suzu.
Sumi?
Oh, Suzu! You cut your hair.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I can't help with work outside on this day of bitter cold.
He grows a beard and marries a crocodile.
Dad fell ill in October and died quickly after.
No.
Yeah.
i1Half box, 5 sen.
an8Business is still busy.
I got lost in the city,
Thanks, Urano Suzu!
i1Mom and Dad joined us after shopping, and we visited our family grave.
I lost my pencil.
Today's art class is free drawing time.
Don't want to.
Oh...
No thanks.
You've gotten quite good.
A boy's come all the way from Kure looking for your hand in marriage.
Kure?
B-But why?
i1I guess I'm becoming an adult.
i1I think Kure is where there's a naval port that's full of sailors.
Never met him.
But, uh, it wasn't easy to find your house.
Okay.
i1I don't know if I should marry him or not.
i1But I wonder, why did I taste caramel in my mouth?
Which way is the station?
Someone left a window open.
You do know your husband-to-be's last name, right?
Here we are.
Oh no!
I'll see you around.
What's wrong? Is yours not ripe?
You don't have to worry about that.
This is...
Oh, hello.
I'm talking about you!
an8I'm sorry, this is all I've got.
Is that so?
an8Then sew one, right now!
I undo the seams... and cut.
Hand me your ration coupon and wallet.
Our mother has a bad leg,
and we brought someone like you to a place you know nothing about.
I'm home.
I was puzzled at first.
Oh, to visit family!Different conversation
I did.Alt: Me? Yes, I did.
He's stationed far away.
Okay then, thank you for your time.
All the dandelions here are white, aren't they?
So you noticed.
It's so quiet without Keiko.
i1And it's done!
The grains are swollen.
That's terrible.
Well, thanks again.
The pillars and tatami mats from Keiko's house were a godsend.
One of them is the Musashi.
What?
I can do it. I can do it.
You're a married couple.
Has she sent coded transmissions?
Does she have a random number table?
I don't know if I can draw you well...
It's so hot...
Eat up!
i1Wow, they have everything here.
The price is only gonna go up from now on.Alt: If ya don't buy now, it's only gonna be more expensive for ya.
i1With that secret stash mother gave me, and this month's budget, I only have 25 yen.
i1What?
Most of us aren't locals, and we don't go beyond these gates.literally: won't leave Official: Most of us aren't locals and we stay within these gates.
Near the ocean?
Kusatsu!
Sure, no problem!
Rin!
That's...
Ah, this is what he wants.
They're quite laid back.
Waking up now wouldn't be any fun.
I see.
i1Eating for only one after all.
Thanks.
So you're here to take a bath?
Don't by shy, now. Just say the word and I'll take her right back home!MTBB did good
And don't call me by my first name!
It's nothing special.
How's the Aoba?
And then you might want to have a nice, long chat.
Oh, that.Official: 'Yes, I remember.' Translates the idea, arguably better but nothing wrong or unnatural about the literal rendering
You coming for me...
I'm just so angry at him! It makes my blood boil!
Is he four years older?
Huh?
Makes me wonder what he was like.
It's nothing.
I'm showing it to you now!
i1If only I had some paint with me now.
So, what about the enemies horsepower?
but how could you fall asleep in the middle of a bombing?literally: air raid. Bombing does sound more natural here
Remove sliding doors!
Remove sliding doors!
Where's Dad?
I'm sorry. That not true.literally: it was a lie
Because if I didn't, I don't know if I could ever find you.
I'll get ready.
All right. Let's go, Harumi.
This sure isn't like you!Alt more literally: Why're you all timid? 'quiet' would work better if I went with this. Official: Don't worry.
Nothing.
Harumi, your mommy is always with you.
Bad timing, huh?
Hang on.
Yes!Official: "We're fine!" I'm going with she can't quite hear them properly so a standard Yes works.
You need to evacuate now!keyframe
Will you draw my brother sometime?
You were there with her.keyframe
She's not herself right now.
i1Rin?i0
Are you able to get up, Suzu?keyframe
Hurry!
i1This is JOFK, Hiroshima Broadcasting.
i1Hang on, people of Kure!
i1The right hand that drew...
Ouch.
It's so sad that Kure keeps being targeted.More literally: It's so sad that Kure has been bombed so many times.
Thanks, Sumi.
i1Don't come here.
Shusaku, I'm...
i1Yes, it's all of those things.
Excuse me, um...
Don't look!
I can't see my children anymore.
I did!
The wounded must stay.
The navy base sent a relief party.
He died sitting here?keyframe
I can hardly look at the poor girl in the eye. I feel so bad.so sorry
i1Kind but strong.
Forever.
Oh, please come in.
It's finally over.
i1A year later, ten years later.
It's so quiet.
No flavor to be found up here.
From now on, this body will be here to smile.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I can't help with work outside on this day of bitter cold.
And Mom, too.
Suzu, look at me.
Will I get better?
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
i1I think I saw Rin a few times, too.
I've been let go.
That's where our home is.More literally: "Our home's on the foothills of that mountain." Obviously doesn't sound natural
I need to work hard too, so I can become a Prima Undine as soon as possible.SallySubs: I need to work hard and become a Prima Undine, too.
Yep! Ever since I was promoted to a Single, I've had this strong determination to succeed.This is the dub. SallySubs: "Absolutely! Getting promoted to Single has worked wonders for my motivation." Sounds good but is this in character?
Certainly.
As a mix of new and old, time flows slowly here.
I need to become a full-fledged Undine as soon as possible, so I can make myself more useful.SallySubs: I need to learn the ropes so I can be useful, too!
Hello, Akira-san...
but would you mind accompanying me, please?
or how Aika-san and Alice-san are for you.Hard to split these two lines well. It looks worse when names are said but it's not in the subs so even though it's a bit uneven, I think this works better
Right!
Akari-san!
So something amazing happened, huh?
Yes, very much so!Alt: Yes, it did!
That's why we're going to walk all over town tomorrow, right?
I'm not one to brag, but I'm full of potential.Alt: "I don't mean to brag, but I'm full of promise." SallySubs: "diamond in the rough." Nice idiom but I'm not sure if it fits.
I'm Anya Dostoyevskaya.
Alice-senpai at Orange Planet mentors me.
Um, look me up, how?
Oh, I see.
Right now, the main Himeya location is eagerly searching for a new president.
So maybe...
I thought I saw a shadow earlier.
All right! We'll help you look!
True. This could be bad.
Please!
It has to be!
He's still watching over us from somewhere, isn't he?
What a scary stone.
I've been looking for you for so long.
Should I step on that stone again?
Never again?
But even though I said goodbye to Cait Sith that day, I feel like I was able to see him again, thanks to Ai-chan.
Perhaps feelings of love can attract miracles?Alt: Perhaps feelings of love are what callsbrings forth miracles.
Thank you for the training!Nozomi: "Thank you in advance for your guidance!" SallySubs: "Thank you for doing this with me."
I need to become a full-fledged Undine as soon as possible, so I can make myself more useful.SallySubs: I need to learn the ropes so I can be useful, too!
By any chance, were you looking for Alicia-san?
Alicia-san's birthday is on the 30th day of the 10th month, and today is the 30th day of the 22nd month,
Akira-san...
I'll leave the present here, so please give it to her tomorrow.
It made me realize that any time the three of us can spend together is something very precious.
I'm not saying I want us to go back to how we were, but...
I'm not sure why,
But it really was a miracle, wasn't it?
The smile on Akira-san's face when she said that,
Thank you very much. Please take my hand.
I don't remember there being an alley here.
Huh? Looking for Cait Sith?
I'm Azusa B. McLaren.
So we got curious and looked you up.
If the new recruit seemed weird after looking her up,
All right! We'll help you look!
Do you two usually practice together?
Cait Sith, huh?
So maybe that means we have to move on from the world that only kids can see?Nozomi: "from things that only children can see?" Either is fine. Went with the more literal one.
One of Neo-Venezia's seven wonders, The Stone of Misfortune.
Ah, it's this late already?
I have to go to school.
Well, then...
One of Neo-Venezia's seven wonders, the Stone of Misfortune, huh?
As expected, nothing happened, President Aria.
The miracle you were given today was a sparkling encounter too, wasn't it?
But even though I said goodbye to Cait Sith that day, I feel like I was able to see him again, thanks to Ai-chan.
Perhaps feelings of love can attract miracles?Alt: Perhaps feelings of love are what callsbrings forth miracles.
What?
Really?Nozomi: Oh.
Little by little, that's how things changed.
Everyone is soothed by that smile and singing voice of hers.
I'm going out now.
Oh, Aika-senpai.
True.
Does that mean...?
It's the fragrance of miracles that Ai-chan and the girls carried in with them.
Such a peculiar twist of fate. Isn't it, Grandma?
she's trying to change how the Prima promotions are carried out, as well as other things.
Even after I graciously declined,
The Gondola Association said they're willing to wait
An apprentice...
I would have stopped time.
Hey, Akari-chan.
The stagnation in my heart is coming undone.
Yes.
The Gondola Association aren't the only ones waiting, but he's waiting for you as well, right?
The time I stopped is beginning to move again.
That's something to be happy about, isn't it?
Sometimes, a wish you thought would never come true
No sappy lines allowed.
From the moment we first met, we've always been connected.Dub used. Sounds the most natural. Nozomi: We've always been connected. From that point on, always...
Orange Princess.
The distant, endless blue.
Of course, an interview and a skill test are a must.
The rule where Singles can give rides to customers with a Prima Undine on board didn't exist back in the day.
So the hearts of countless people whose names we'll never know
became the city's feelings which support us today.
It's fine, it's fine. Don't mind us!
Alice-senpai was looking forward to it,
It's the Acqua Alta, President Aria!
Aqua is so full of miracles!
Okay, let's start our plan!
Yeah!
Nope!
Okay. Then do you want to make pancakes for lunch with me?
No! Please don't do that.
Well then, let's all do our part!
It sure is strange.Alt: wondrous; odd; peculiar; a mystery
I see. So that's why everyone said they we're busy today.
No sappy lines allowed!
Starting with my encounter with President Aria, things slowly grew over time.
It fills me with joy.
She must be tired.
members of the Association visited me frequently.
President Aria.
I should let myself grow alongside her, at my beloved Aria Company.
What is this?
as if a magic spell had been cast over it.
I wanted it to stay like that forever.
When you had to say goodbye to that nightshine chime, how did you feel?
I felt lonely. Very lonely.
That's why even my loneliness is proof of how blessed I am.
Loneliness and sadness are proof of how blessed you are, huh?
Yes.
Are you awake?
I haven't relaxed like this in ages!
an2Seed of a wish?
That's something to be happy about, isn't it?
That's why we keep collecting seeds, don't we?
Orange Princess.
My future Queen.
Thank you, my Aquamarine.
an2...towards our future!
It is a city recreated from the original Venice that once existed on Manhome.
Back when Alicia-san was still active,
she was busy dawn to dusk every single day.
Don't you have some business here?
I didn't even think to realize.
Aqua's calendar has 24 months in a year, so you celebrate birthdays 12 months after you're born too.
I came to show off and laugh at her sullen expression after she gets jealous of my time off, so...
Is that so?
Thank you.
I need to prepare for a workshop we're holding tonight, so I'll be taking my leave.
Yes! I want to practice the route Alicia-san often uses.
Just so you know, I won't be going easy on you.
Happy birthday, Alicia!
The things we take for granted might just all be miracles in themselves.
Or... are you here for me?
a6What do I do now? I want to hit her with a fist!
Hey! What're you doing?!
I refuse!
Aqua! Hey, Aqua!
Control your people a little!
Now, go forth.
Do you have an unhealthy interest in a crusader's laundry?
then replaced it with some cheap hooch since I figured she couldn't tell the difference.
And since the priest in question is constantly causing problems,
That chest is the chest of a devil!
God forgives all.
The Axis faith teaches forgiveness in all things.
or a questionably-human fan of animal-eared girls...
I... I feel as though my eyes have been opened!
Well, whatever. Do what you want.
I'm heading into the bath.
This town...
How's that, sir?
Huh, I guess.
I was originally just going to drag that pair of lazybones outside,
imagining where Darkness is going to wash first, right?
Create Water!
What do you mean, trouble?!
but I couldn't help it.
Really? Wow, that's something.
but why bother with such an elaborate conspiracy?
Sitting here like this, the town seems pretty nice.
Here comes one!
No need to to be shy!
I don't have that much...
Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
...town.
I-It's not like that!
There's a good reason for all this!
Aqua, the goddess of water!
Quit screwing around!
a6Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!
That witch who claims the name of a goddess!
It's important that you do this. It's the right thing to do.
Y'know, you're actually kinda...
Hey!
It's the real deal!
Wait, someone's there.
Look out!
Could it be you were the one poisoning the water source?
Slime!
a6Yeah, fine.
Hans!
What now, Wiz? You want to take me on?
You seem to have real backbone.
What, now? A leader of the Devil King's army?
Sorry! Really sorry about this!
P-Please stop teasing Aqua-sama!
Whatever it is, once I finish with these hot springs, I'll be done with this town.
I'll finally be able to leave this disgusting town behind!
Isn't that right?
The same for knights... They collect taxes,
Since they receive that payment,
Everyone, get back! It's dangerous!
You polluted our hot springs!
Don't call it sneaky.
I-I can shoot it?! Okay, I'll shoot it!
Detonation... Detonation... Detonation...
Is it over?
But it's not over yet.
Slay the demons. Defeat the Devil King.
God Blow!
God Requiem!
I'll indulge you, since it's been a while.
an8i1Guided by the goddess of fate, I was reincarnated in another world.
an8i1begins once again!
Don't let your head get as big as your boobs!
Just how easy are you?!
I won't stop anyone who cares to join him in prison.
Screw you guys! What about our freedom? Keep protesting!Try harder! Keep the protest going!
"It may be surprising, but I apparently have good luck!"Matched to S1 E10
You're coming with me!Match above
I'd never abandon a friend.
First, use that wire to pick the cell's lock.
Did they, now?
They're good.
But today, I have the perfect solution!
I was just trying to give Kazuma a present...
First off, where are you from, and what did you do before you became an adventurer?
I'm from Japan. I was a student there.
Why pretend to be a student?
I've heard that once you fell into debt, you complained regularly.
I understand that.
Personally, I felt like,
I've said this a million times! I made that call to save the town!
I led a ragtag team of beginning adventurers to destroy the Destroyer!
Don't the prosecutors here even know how to serve tea?!
Do I
Uh... Well, that's correct, but it wasn't exactly
W-Well, that's true.
a man who would even dropkick a girl in the ovaries!Matched to S1 E05
The knave!
i1I'm screwed so hard, shit's coming out my mouth!
Kazuma's warped personality is plain as day,
Megumin!
First!
The use of explosion magic in the vicinity of the town
Not so fast, Judge.
i1Stupid Middle Ages!
This trial's a load of crap!
Ahem...
Don't you dare call me that!
Guided by a goddess of fate, I was reincarnated in another world...
Darkness...
I reserve the right to be selective!
Kazuma might be an adventurer, but he's no criminal!
But since I wasn't there, there's nothing I could have done!
Wait. Th-That's right.
It was my command!
If only one of us has to take the fall here, that's for the best!
It might be hard, but suck it up!
And besides, even if you guys don't back me up,
Er, um...
Oh, look at the dust...
Damn it... So much for the town where new adventurers get their start.
It's a combination lock...
Guess I'll sleep.
Kazuma! Hey, Kazuma, wake up!
but they were accused of being behind the explosion.
But today I've got the perfect solution!
A hacksaw?
And how will you get it in here?
Never heard of a stepping box for a present before.
Why'd it go off?!
But?
Are you satisfied?
Th-That's horrible! What jerks are calling me that?!
Just for the record, I should ask...
Do you truly have no connection to the Devil King's army?
I guess they called me down for this.
I saw him swinging around that girl's panties the street!
He said he was an advocate of true gender equality,
Thank you very much.
What a deviant.
That's horrible.
What trash.
I will admit that Kazuma has a warped personality,
The basis for the case? Very well.
The use of explosion magic in the vicinity of the town
That's enough!
Your honor, will you hear me out?
They're said to be the king's greatest allies! They're famous!
I don't really get why, but you're not getting executed, and that's a good thing!
Hup! A celebratory Nature's Beauty!
No, it'll be fine.
First, to prove that I'm not a member of the Devil King's forces.
She's probably...
Anyway, what were the two of you making a fuss about?
As we speak, Darkness might be...
"But don't think you'll have your way with my heart!"
It's too late.
Listen up. When she gets back,
The toads haven't slowed down, despite the cold...
We must get much, much stronger in order to survive
all I can do is slow this one down.
Hurry and do something!
In light of that, I decided to learn a new skill.
Hey! That arrow almost messed up the best part of my hair
Stupid! You don't have enough attack power to beat these toads!
Rival?
I-It's been a long time, Megumin!
Today is the day we finally settle our long-standing score!
An arch wizard and master of advanced magic!
a6Then when can we have a duel?!
Really?
I can't even begin to imagine Megumin being any good at unarmed combat.
M-Megumin...
Damn you!
the bounds of society.
You reek of toads!
What is it?
Surely you've heard of "ladies first"?
I'm not backing down on this one!
I'm surprised at your lack of resolve.
Hey...
It's bad for my heart!
I-I didn't!
Hey, Megumin.
What a quirk of fate!
Maybe this would be good?
Well, yes.
being able to use this more effectively is proof of greater spell casting skill!
I wouldn't even mind a devil for a friend at this point...
Is this going to make us friends?!
My duel... I finally got her to duel, and...
a6but he's become a seasoned and formidable adventurer.
...losion!
...sion!
And this booze is the best!
Hasn't this place been thoroughly explored already?
I've got the thief skills "Enemy Detection" and "Lurk."
Ow!
Explos
it looks very much like you're shaking in fear with each step.
Something's coming.
That's not it!
Maybe I really should ditch her.
Normally, this kind of thing involves watching for traps,
What we're doing probably seems like heresy to people
Don't say that.
pretend to be humans in order to prey on other monsters.
I really would've been in trouble if I'd been alone.
No party could've made it through here without an arch priest...
I can still smell undead in the area.
My name is Keele. I built this dungeon and kidnapped a noble's daughter.
In other words, you're not an evil wizard, but a good one?
Who in the world is this?
Hey, Aqua.
didn't his undead minions go after you?
Hey, let go!
Wait!
I'm sorry, so use Lurk on me, too!
Kazuma, he...
This proves chances are worth taking, even if they seem unlikely!
We can divide up the spoils 9:1.
You're too young for that!
Nope!
This is on me. Please enjoy.
M-Megumin!
This doesn't pay my debt, and I'm still under suspicion, but...
I can't keep this up!
It's freezing.Matched to S1 E08
but I doubt Darkness would simply
"But you'll never have your way with my heart!"
What do we do, Kazuma?!
It's too late.
Is Satou Kazuma here?!
Neither rain nor sleet nor snow nor hail is slowing those toads down.
i1Snipe!snoipe
L-Look out!
This is bad! There's not enough food
Kazuma, there's your chance!
No!
Excuse me, but I think I'm starting to get swallowed.
Who might you be?
I mean, it's strange that you never gave your name.
There are some who start off with weird names,
an8One duel! Just one!
an8I said no.
I can no longer use my magic today,
I mean, you barely attended martial arts class at the academy.
And every lunch period, you'd show up like clockwork,
Due to personal circumstances, her lunches were the only thing keeping me alive.
Now then, come at me as you will!
I'll grab you with both arms
an8C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
She actually ran off crying.
Surely you've heard of "ladies first"?
This guy's actually taking his clothes off!
Or does Captain Kazuma explain with his nightstick?!
Wha?!lol wtf did you expect
You call me a bitch-chicken?!
an8Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?!
And she's the same age as you, huh?
Well, I mean, anyone seeing this would probably think
i1I don't even have the strength to stand.
i1we dropped by Wiz's shop to figure out what to do about my debt.
Do you have absolutely no social skills whatsoever?Matched to S1 E11
I don't want to hear any more!
Well, yes.
I hardly see the need to make friends.
It's a duel, Megumin!
You're awesome, Sis!
She's working odd jobs to take her "friends" out to eat?!
Is this going to make us friends?!
I'll just put this on your tab, Kazuma-san.
Come to think of it, didn't we use to compete to see who would grow up faster?
You say you're an adult, so why don't we do that again?
Shut up!
Who are you?
Hey! Word choice!
What is it?
My father doesn't hold Aldarp in high regard,
Our valued...
Thank you, Aqua.
Oh, it's fine! Something like this is a piece of cake for a goddess!
What do you mean, I should accept the arranged marriage?!
Don't you care if Darkness can't adventure with us anymore?!
We cannot afford to ignore it!
My adventuring friends.
Hey, that looks good on you.
He requested I ensure his daughter wouldn't cause an incident.
You can call me Mistress Dus
You finally came out and admitted it...
What exactly is that pure, focused gaze of his?!
is what nobles are supposed to do!
He needs to be weak-willed enough that, despite my love for him,
A failure at life, who tries to take the easiest route possible!
Why don't you use that nasty body of yours to earn us some cash?"
I am Dustiness Ford Lalatina.
Why don't you two go for a walk in the garden?
I enjoy a bit of goblin hunting
you should learn to maintain a lascivious gaze, like Kazuma here!
Show me the strength of your resolve!
You spineless fool!
H-Hey... How about a little wager?
Here's my chance!
Oh, don't get ahead of me, you greedy girl!
Because what I have in mind is way crazier than whatever you're thinking!
Look forward to it!
Go on, take that warm bath and cry your heart out.
My daughter has always been a bit awkward around people...
Sorry, but I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
I don't care if you're a lord's son!
I see. You're having Kazuma-kun's child, then?
A grandchild... My first grandchild...
That Kazutrash and Darkness are
Are you aware that "tough love" is often harder on the one giving
"Because of me"?
a6Uh-huh.
Kazuma, Kazuma.
If I go in, I'll be left behind again!
Could this be because of these strange monsters?
Leave it to me!
Welcome to my dungeon, adventurers!
I am Vanir.
who is rumored to be even more powerful than the Devil King?
is the dark emotions you humans are so ashamed of!
On to my next plan, I suppose.
Hey, cut that out!
Don't blurt stuff like that out!
Why don't you two step aside?
I'm sure you can enjoy the crazy demands you're expecting, with no interruptions!
Damn it, why was that thing lying on the floor?
How tough must her mind be?!
Oh, pipe down!
Now, how long can you endure it?
K-Kazuma, this mind-reading devil just said something that piqued my interest...
Shut up!
Oh, we can't have that.
You heard him, Kazuma!
This is the most intense pain I've ever felt!
Hang in there!
What did you just say?
Don't trouble yourself.
You really hung in there, Darkness!
Watch it!
It appeals directly to my Crimson Demon sense of values!
and now you're all high and mighty?!
I used to think you were the only sane member of Kazuma's party!
Please, do something!
Hey, I'm in trouble here!
Then, even if it's just for a second, take control from Vanir,
when I'm drawing out the full potential of this girl's strength?
If you can overpower me...
...to try it...
What?!
So I'm offering you a choice:
Now, Megumin!
If this goes badly, I want you to act as a witness
Not having to worry about being executed is a big relief.
After being hit with Megumin's explosion magic,
In addition to your valuable aid with the destruction of the Mobile Fortress Destroyer,
If you want to go outside so bad, go without me!
You're acting far more childish right now, Aqua!
At this rate...
But why don't you convince that loser before me?!
But we weren't able to savor our victory for long.
It wasn't for long, but we shared a body and wreaked havoc together.
Hey, welcome, folks!
Why isn't he hurt at all?!
He should be harmless as a result.
Come on.
Don't underestimate me.
So... tired...
I realize this might be asking a bit much, but let's call a ceasefire.
When did you order a sword like that, Kazuma?
And then...
First-rate warriors don't demonstrate their techniques for show...
Muramasa?
The fastest male becomes the King Runner,
Say what, now?
From now on, this sword is named Chunchunmaru.
Kill Quest
And if any manage to get past her,
Uh-huh.
and the first one to get here is the King!
Force Fire!
We could've neutralized them by just taking out the King and Princess,
I was just trying to help! Don't yell at me!
a6Yes?!
Huh?! Why wouldn't you...
Wait...
T-Take your time!
What a relief!
Don't you get bored in this big, empty room?
That's it!
To be honest, I'm not here all the time.
a6The padded goddess down there actually
W-W-Wait a second!
Well, Kazuma-san...
I did it because you made that dumb joke about not coming back.
Seriously, what did she do to me?
Kinda feels like...
but I have to question this kind of self-flattery.
S-Stupid!
You were there when Megumin wrote this on me!
a6Right now, I'm an adventurer with some friends in the town of
The finest quality tea is ready once again, Kazuma-san.
Would you pipe down? It's too early.
And to think, that little barrier could put you in this state!
We demons are particular about contracts,
See here, cut that out! Don't try to take it off while I'm talking!
I've decided that I'll make my living doing business from now on.
and hire some incredibly strong adventurers?!
I can't accept it! I refuse to!
Don't group me with the pervert over there.
H-Hot springs, eh?
Is everybody ready?
It even uses running water to grant a degree of privacy by making sound.
Unfortunately, the dimwitted owner
As soon as I take my eyes off her, she purchases the most bizarre things...
Can you wrap this as a gift?
Prepare yourself!
H-Hello?
Huh?
Hey, Kazuma!
Let's take this wagon!
No one said it was by elimination!
Yep.
Hey, that's dirty! You buffed your luck with magic!
Even when I was a kid, I never lost at rock-paper-scissors.
is the fact that you describe what you've been doing as "gracious help"!
Can someone switch with me now?
Well, now... I can't see it,
But they say the Princess Runner was killed the other day,
Running Hawk Kites?
and only turn away at the last second.
I'm sorry our crusader is so hard.
Okay!
Adventurers, if you please!
...this...
...us!
You, crusader! You're not one of the guards, so stay back!
She's facing all those monsters without backing down at all!
She's so brave!
A game of speed in which competitors charge at an obstacle
Fireball!
Closest thing is a cave we use for shelter from the heat!
It's an emergency! No way around it!
We'll let you loose!
No! Stop it! Don't look, Kazuma!
I have to say, that was impressive!
To think you had a magic user powerful enough to use explosion magic!
Hey! Megumin, Wiz, wake up!
Oh, wandering souls, rest in peace!
Amazing! She got all those zombies at once!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Well, enjoy your holiday, folks!
And this is town is its home?
How about it? Please, join us!
I feel as though I was on the edge of a beautiful river,
Seriously, it's fine!
L-Let go!
I'm actually a believer in the Eris faith.
And don't let it bother you too
But if you're not, I'm not gonna hold back!
Hey, wait, don't abandon me, sir!
You are the millionth to pass down this street!
We were in the same class! Do you remember me?
And it's so easy on your skin! I'm serious!
Even in a city full of religious nutcases,
My dear friends, Funifura-san and Dodonko-san. About coming to visit, please don't do it! I'm sure you're busy, so don't put yourselves out on my behalf. I'm actually pretty occupied myself, as well. Is it all right if you wait a bit before coming by? Please. Please, I beg for your patience. -Yunyun
I wanna talk to whoever's in charge!
Are you all right in the head?
Hang on, did a magic user and an arch priest come by here?
Hey! What're you doing?!
That chest is the chest of a devil!
I will share holy words that will help you avoid demonic temptation.
Eris pads her chest!
I-I'm thinking about going sightseeing tomorrow, too.
Y-You...
I'm
What a lovely bath.
This soap is nice and sudsy, right?
I was originally just going to drag that pair of lazybones outside,
Hey, Kazuma! Are you there? You are, aren't you?!
I guess he's not there.
It makes sense.
Create Water!
This is too much!
Tell me why!
I'm a goddess! I'm a goddess, and he did that!
The quality of the hot springs has been dropping a bit lately.
So, you'll all help me, right?
Soap, detergent, soap, detergent, soap, detergent...
soap, detergent, soap, detergent, soap, detergent!
Wiz? You feeling better?
Well, actually
But we can't rest easy yet!
I-It's not like that!
my name is Aqua.
What's going on?
The witch who claims the name of a goddess!
It'll cut off the rotten smell at the source!
I just want to save the town!
pretty attractive, in a way!
Fine. If you really don't want to let me in,
replaced the hot springs with hot water?!
We definitely can't let you in!
I figured that's how it'd go.
a6Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, don't push me! What are you trying to do?!
Come on, milady, calm down!
I'm so, so sorry!
We're so sorry for our insolence.
Aren't you younger than I am, Kazuma?!
That's...
He was feeling pretty violated by the Axis Church.
I'm not sure what you mean...
It's me, Wiz! Come on, Hans-san! Hans-san!
Where do you think you're going, Hans?!
a6Oh, right.
Did you think your excuses would actually work, Hans?!
I spent ages doing this as quietly as possible...
When you hunted us as an arch wizard,
Don't worry, Kazuma.
Aqua!
Finally!
Cursed Crystal Prison!
However...
But the nice old man who oversaw these hot springs didn't do anything wrong!
This is...
The girl with the blue hair was telling the truth!
Damn it!
Can't you come up with some sneaky plan to deal with this, like usual?!
a6Purification! Purification!
Synchronize yourself with the red smoke, and atone in a surge of blood!
Let go of me, you cultist!
Get back!
It can't be...
no gratitude.
What? Really?
Welcome back.
a6Thanks for your support, everyone!
Straight.
Which brand of whiskey would you like?
Thanks for waiting.
There's something I'd like to ask of a veteran adventurer who just made a newbie girl drink hard liquor.
Alright, you can count me in!
Even I have the right to choose who or what I explode
I guess I've got no choice! Let's go! Let's go right now!
I don't care anymore, just give it back you thieving NEET!
Since it's so weak that Megumin can kill it by herself, let's get it over with and go home.
It's times like these you can rely on me.
Are you okay, Darkness?!
What's wrong?
This guy...!
I'll make you something even cooler later, so do something!
O crucible which melts my soul,
I'm sure.
Gosh.
You didn't get a single syllable right! It's Mitsurugi!
Sorry, it was all over in a flash so I had forgotten about you.
You really don't change, do you?
You've come to look quite sharp, Mitsurugi-kun!
Guys! My Threat Sensing skill just pinged!
Megumin and I can't do anything in an enclosed space like this,
Aqua, those golems must be possessed by ghosts!
I wonder if we can find any hints on how to open it.
What's this?
with the goal of defeating the Demon Lord and saving the world.
I am having some difficulty in creating an item capable of opposing the Demon Lord.
I'm gonna live how I want, and I'm only gonna make what I want to make.
I tried getting in, but nope.
And I need to lower their strength!
What, are they in their rebellious phase?
They don't listen to a word I say, but they're all my precious children.
Why, thank you.
That would be bad.
You are my master?
What?
It's time for your punishment.
After the events of that day, the golems protecting those ruins were finally laid to rest.
The others keep making fun of me, saying that I've got bad taste in men.
I want more money!
We can't just let them be lazy.
I understand that, but...
You shouldn't laugh!
U-Umm, Satou Kazuma-san...
U-Umm, I've always thought this about you but, umm...
Steal!
No!
...sion!
No.
Hey, can't we wait until Darkness gets back?
For beginners... Keele's Dungeon?
It's a very serious matter.
Don't.
Why do you suppose he holed up in a place like this?
I'll head in first. You guys wait here.
Debt goddess?
Nothing will change the fact that I'm a goddess!
i1She's definitely gonna screw something up!
My madness?
Hey, if my keen eyes aren't deceiving me,
Want to know what I'm thinking about right now?
Aqua, you dummy.
I heard you rustling around, so I turned the other way to sleep.
Aqua, you're different today.
i1Normally, this kind of thing involves watching for traps,
Yeah, Enemy Detection's going off.
i1Natural selection even applies to the dungeon ecosystem?
Nature's Beauty!
Hey, you okay?
I'm speechless.
Unfortunately, undead can't do anything as surreal as killing themselves.
When you awaken, you will find before you a goddess
i1We left the chamber with the treasure Keele gave us.
Am I supposed to lower my holy aura to that of Kazuma, the sh-NEET?!
A sh-NEET telling a goddess to take cues from a pair of undead?!
But we can get refills today, right?
No fair!
Miss, I cannot thank you enough for the service you have provided us.
Steal! Steal! Steal!
Steal! Steal!
GirlsOr I'll cut your dick off!
i1I actually feel like an adventurer!
You're the one who threw it in the fireplace, dear.
Kazuma! Save the abuse for later!
Wha?!
What is it?
The reason I was away for so long
Please! Come with me, and help me convince my father otherwise!
Here you go.
I'm Kazuma.
You will accompany us at once.
i1Hang on...
i1Aqua, I can manage,
My adventuring friends.
Hey, that looks good on you.
If we weren't in a noble's mansion,
Sir Walther!
I thought you were going to help me!
I'm even prepared to be disinherited!
Even then, I will survive as best I can
and continue accepting quests I'm unqualified for,
Besides, he's far from my ideal man.
First, he seems to be of absolutely decent character.
He works hard
Hey, milady.
i1Hee-hee?
I'll test your mettle there!
A true noble maintains a lascivious gaze, like Kazuma here!
I could never raise my sword against a woman.
You spineless wretch!
Don't hold back! Keep it coming!
You spineless fool!
but then he uses ice magic?!
That's it, Darkness!
Kazuma-san, cut it out! You're gonna get me executed, too!
Please.
These clothes... Is it already over?
Of course not!
Do you have some disease where you'll freak out if
The monsters aside,
Please let us help.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Why are you so calm about this?!
Kazuma, stay behind me.
No!
I could just leave you in the dungeon
One of the Devil King's commanders?!
who is rumored to be even more powerful than the Devil King?
I was asked by the Devil King to look into what became of Verdia.
who seems to have a strange talent for losing more money the harder she works.
I had intended to use them to clear this dungeon of monsters...
How rude, coming from the man who loafed around his room like a bear,
How can you say that like you were there?!
I was going to use a friend's store to save up money
That priest comrade of yours created this irritating magic circle!
I can see it... I see it quite clearly.
After all, I have an iron-clad rule about not killing humans.
If you leave right now,
with the magic circle before heading home?
She's like the very model of a crusader!
To be able to resist my control...
'Scuse me, coming through.
Woman, are you actually enjoying this situation?
Okay, Darkness, let's join Aqua and get the hell out of here.
Not another step, boy!
You really hung in there, Darkness!
I am
Nice try!
Stand still!
Darkness! Resist Vanir so that he can't move!
It won't come off!
Vanir... It wasn't for long, but the time we shared wasn't bad.
To think my death wish would play out like this...
And I absolutely refuse to be purified by the gods I oppose!
Now, awaken from your slumber,
The dedication you have shown in this incident was magnificent,
Darkness was badly hurt and weakened,
Now, for the adventurer Satou Kazuma and his party...
No! No way!
Are you two basically little kids who want to go play outside?!
Okay, even I would rather not end up like that...
But we weren't able to savor our victory for long.
Wiz is also one of the Devil King's commanders.
It wasn't for long, but we shared a body and wreaked havoc together.
as she was in front of the store spouting embarrassing nonsense...
Defeating Vanir-san has cleared up those spying charges of yours.
Quit messing around!
Vanir-san actually wanted to leave his post as one of the Devil King's commanders.
You, boy from a distant land...
Eek!
The theft of my magic power is a crime deserving of a thousand
Ugh, it's still so cold...
You mentioned needing that for your new financial venture, right?
And while I was at it,
You just need to write a name for it on this talisman, and attach it to the handle.
Your partner seems a lot shorter now.
Hey!
That sounds like a real handful...
I'm ready to go anytime!
I'll blow them all to smithereens.
I can tell that's the Princess, but...
I know! The King is the fastest one, right?
Are you not satisfied unless you screw up every single time?!
And if I have to make up for it later, it'll just be the same as always!
You could've said that sooner!
Explosion!
Wait...
Darkness!
That was a close one...
K-Kazuma?! Are you all right?!
Try to live a bit more carefully, okay?
It wasn't easy to find a work-around to let you come back to life last time.
But you were a little too careless this time.
so she was trampled and kicked by the lizards, and started crying...
In that case, is it okay if I wait here with you for a bit?
a6She's probably as phony about other stuff as she is her boobs, so be careful!
Hey! Cut it out! What are you doing to my body?!
I did it because you made that dumb joke about not coming back.
Megumin! Where the hell is Megumin?!
You were there when Megumin wrote this on me!
What exactly are you calling the holy sword Excalibur?!
When she gets back, I'll skin her alive!
R-Really?
and show me that which you would have us sell in our establishment!
With a parasite who has to suck on negative human emotions to barely manage existing?
and seek to prey on the pure of heart...
If you'd prefer monthly profit sharing, I can offer you one million eris a month.
Get out! Hurry up and get lost!
Anyway, why don't we go take on a kill quest?
and I still ended up dying again!
What exactly do you think the Devil King is?!
Come on, Darkness, say something to Darkness?
So, about our deal...
Is that all?
They'll sell! I'm sure they'll fly off the shelves!
E-Excuse me!
You're serious?
You cheated, didn't you?! Please, one more! Just one more time!
You were born with a special ability?!
Are you saying my special ability is being able to win at rock-paper-scissors?!
is the fact that you describe what you've been doing as "gracious help"!
Kazuma, I can't believe you went there!
the males compete in a mating ritual like a chicken race.
Well, they'll probably just charge into some nearby rock. Nothing to worry about.
Maybe, somewhere in the caravan,
are headed straight for that crusader!
She's so brave!
Forgive me! Forgive me!
Oh, boy! Here they come, here they come!
K-Kazuma, this time... this time I'm surely done for!
Stop it! There are people watching! Don't say another word!
All right!
Sir, you'd better hurry!
Nah, I was just impressed with how well you were doing.
is exciting to watch.
Again! Do that trick again!
Hang in there, Wiz!
Sure thing.
H-Hello?
but this place is more beautiful than any of them.
Is it natural? I'm jealous! I'm ever so jealous!
You should thank Darkness, not me.
Can I do anything to thank you?
There's a caf run by the Axis Church just up ahead!
But you just made that "Mmn!" sound.
is trying to force me into his dark ways!
If you wanna get in my way, then I'll let you have it!
It's me! You know, me! How've you been?
Here, take this detergent!
Oh, don't worry about paying!
It's actually some amazing stuff!
What is wrong with this town?
You never break character, do you?
And the scary lady here is Darkness.
How do you write "Satou Kazuma"?
I always look forward to tuna season...
What?! Come on, today's Explosion magic was worth at least worth 120 points!
I... I...
it's only natural that I'd speak up!
Wonderful! Magnificent!
And what is with you two? Do you secretly like me or something?
Are you jealous because of my romantic developments with Yunyun?
an8Why would anyone be jealous about that?!
Wait a second, Kazuma!
That seriously isn't gonna cut it!
Do you really expect me to wait until your kid grows up?!
You seriously want a toddler to take on the Devil King?
I-I can't believe you!
You're usually so wishy-washy! Why the sudden streak of manliness?!
Do I strip here? Or in my room?!
What should we do, Megumin?!
Well, I think I'll head back to the village.
who somehow still manages to be under-leveled!
I haven't settled on a craftsman to build the products you've dreamed up.
dragging them back to their communities, and doing all kinds of crazy stuff to them!
You're okay now, though. It's all right.
You really are worried about everyone!
Kazuma, would you like to hear an embarrassing secret about Yunyun?
We Crimson Demons are born with a tattoo somewhere on our bodies.
You can't use your joke Explosion magic around here, anyway!
Enough, you two! If you're too loud, they'll find us.
Kazuma, say something!
Go on, get!
Hey, priest lady, what gives?
You really think we're gonna just let them walk?!
W-Wait a second... You're not gonna...
H-H-Holy crap, that was scary...
The dark flame born from my ebon heart will scorch you!
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!
D-Dad? Could you repeat that?
That was just me sending you an update!
Should be showing up anytime now.
I said we never should've attacked the Crimson Demons!
What do I do?
See how the mug moves around once I've flipped it over?
It's a magnet! It must be some kind of magnet!
You really shouldn't. It's embarrassing.
I just told you that we're only friends!
Well, for starters...
You bathed together.
But in spite of it all, she says you're an important friend...
but being called an important friend does make me kind of happy.
It's perfectly fine. She's old enough to get married,
Sleep.
Is this...
And what if it develops into pneumonia?
Wouldn't that be the exact moment that she'd wake up?!
In this kind of situation, I bet I could even beat Sena in a court of law!
Hey, Megumin.
Are you guys bad at keeping things sealed or what?!
Do you have another just like this?
All of them?
it can't hurt to have a few more in my wardrobe.
I mean, fine, but...
Isn't this...
Oh, sir, do you recognize it?
That's pretty clearly a rifle.
Hey, cut it out! That's a confidentiality violation!
The foremost among Crimson Demons who love their brothers,
Who're they?
Classmates from when we attended the magic academy.
People might believe the things you write,
And Megumin was sad on her own,
That sounds like a lovely party.
with that sparkly sword-like spell?
When I was a student, in order to learn Explosion magic,
I endured it day after day,
You mean she covered for you so you could learn Explosion magic?
She's a real freak! Her attacks are worthless, but she's sturdy as they come!
As long as there is light in my eyes, you will not pass!
Vanir?!
Vanir-sama is dead?!
The Dullahan, Verdia, and Hans the Deadly Poison...
You beast! Kazuma, you beast!
Back then, you accepted an aimless wizard
when I can't move after casting it. Thank you.
Let me out! Let me out, please!
I'm really regretting all those nice things I said.
I'm sorry!
Hell yeah, you did!
Okay!
You better not expect any mercy just because you're hot!
My name is Satou Kazuma!
I'm taking him as a hostage.
Have I actually entered a popular phase?
I'm not a pure demon, so it's not going to kill me.
So apologize!
It's about time I got an apology, since I always try so hard for you all!
Obviously not!
How can you be so oblivious?!
Even these boobs you're so fond of were something I added to my body.
Just holding you like this has my breasts and lower body feeling all tingly!
Why do I feel something pressing into my butt?
I've finally gotten this close.
an8I managed to trap Sylvia in here with a bit of skillful deceit.
Hey, damn it!
Come on, Satou Kazuma.
Even we couldn't figure out how to use it. It'll be fine.
Aw, come on!
I'll run a lap around the village while doing a handstand!
Did you think I was just going to take the weapon with me?
You can stand there and watch as I wipe this village off the map!
Oh, our visitors.
It's a shame this happened while you were here.
O-Okay, let's head there right now!
It'll be fine!
I'm all out of ideas!
Take your hands off my ears!
and they called it "our natural enemy!"
Fight sorcerer technology with sorcerer technology.
Sylvia-sama!
Now, despair...
We've got them now!
That's the chief's daughter!
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!
and future leader of this village!
Yunyun!
an8Sacred Exorcism! Sacred Exorcism! Sacred Exorcism!
Shut up! We need to help Yunyun before she's really in trouble!
It comes! It comes! The hordes of flame...
Sylvia!
Join us... Come with us!
Life!
Crap, crap, crap, crap!
Megumin, stop squirming!
You can't hide the truth from a demon that reads minds.
You damned traitors!
It pisses me off!
It seems physical damage isn't doing much, either.
Like... like... like...
and you never run out of crazy ideas.
Leave it to me!
Now, everyone, while Kazuma and the others are buying time,
Sylvia.
I can't believe you...
...so much!
I love you!
of everyone in the village!
Let's go...
This... is... my popular phase!
I would've probably been blasted beyond even smithereens.
But ain't that what adventuring's all about?
It's time to wake up. I'll be sealing my Explosion magic away.
Thanks...
You haven't done your daily Explosion today, right?
It's freezing.
Th-The fire!
Some hoodlum or outlaw?
I'm a goddess, a bona fide deity!
and you're running a shop?!
Getting full of yourself, lich bitch?!
i1This is Wiz.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Who's your servant?! Me?! Hell no!
Away with you, lich!
That's quite a feat.
Oh, yes.
I did it, Kazuma!
The King only asked me to put a barrier around his castle!
but pleaseonly if I put a barrier around his castle for him, please.
How about "Drain Touch"?
This is a battle between a lich and a goddess!
Look, we're not getting anywhere, so let her!
Not bad! Yes, not bad at all!
lonely and alone, without so much as a glimpse of her parents' faces!
She likes sweet, hard drinks
Dismissed!
Are you all right?
I'm gonna borrow the veranda for a
Did you really just go there?!
I'm here.
Are you really there?
You're really, really there? Like right there, right?
but we've got a bigger problem closing in!
Damn... We're gonna have to fight!
Damn evil spirits!
Here is a special reward for exorcising the evil spirits.
Well, you see,
Yes.
Huh?
I'm level 21,
Huh?
Destroyer, explosion!
Bya-boom!
i1But we still have many other problems left to solve.
You too, big boys. Over here.
i1He's not an adventurer?!
Well, then, I will explain how things work.
As you know, many adventurers board together in stables...
but we do so in moderation so as not to affect your adventures or daily life.
i1Wonderful! Beyond wonderful!
i1If everyone was in a constant state of afterglow,
Really?
Their personality, speech patterns, appearance, and even how much they like you.
I've never been more glad that I joined this party than I am today.
Is it that amazing?
i1Oh, no!
Here. Tinder!
an8Aqua, Aqua, what does it taste like?
I feel like a billion eris!
Did the food my family sent not suit your tastes?
i1Stop! Don't give me such a pure and innocent smile!
It's my thanks for everything.
an8Come on!
i1Crap, my heart is racing.
i1Argh, what do I do? What should I do?
i1I'm so anxious and horny that I can't sleep!
i1The lantern went out?
Come on over here.
Hurry! I'm about to explode in more ways than one!I can't stand it anymore, in all sorts of ways!
I-Is it just me? Is my sense of decency perverted?
Next you lose the towel.watBoobs can function as scrubbers
No! This is wrong!
That devil came to shmex and suck the vitality out of you!
What's the big idea?
You accursed succubus! You put me through so much humiliation.
I'll perform that succubus's last rites.
You don't remember any of it since you were under that succubus's spell, right?
You were somewhat overbearing and even frightening,
You need to learn how to be a decent, normal person.
What?!
Yeah, yeah.
The Destroyer was created by an ancient magical kingdom, correct?
Let's get the heck out of here before it destroys us.
No, we can't.
Not on hand.
The penniless shopkeeper is here!
They might not consider it such,
I'm sorry for being so selfish and stubborn.
I see.
Hey, Wiz!
Hey! What happened to your love for explosion magic?!
You're gonna stand and let Wiz outdo youlet a bigger one rip?
Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark,
I expected nothing less from a lich so many levels above my own.
I concede this round.
Come on, let's go back and celebrate!
i1All hands, evacuate immediately.
Huh? Hey!
Take a look at that.
They asked what I would need to power it. Nothing can!
Not like I can get off. Or turn it off.
Wh-What is it?
i1What a letdown...
Oh, good.
Do that, then!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Wait.
an8Stare...
Megumin!
Now I shall show you true explosion magic!
Don't suck out too much, okay?!
i1Our battle against the mobile fortress, Destroyer, is over.
i1This world is crap.
Adventurer Satou Kazuma.
What? You're not getting a reward?
i1That's right. Nothing goes the way I want it to at all.
i1of a popular online game that goes on sale today.
Damn publishers. Store-exclusive preorder merch is the bane of my existence, and they know it.
She's alive.
What is it?
Huh? Then what happened?
I died of shock?!
i1I've never even met this girl before. What's her deal?
Stop! Stop!
Well, then...
I'm a goddess in charge of guiding humans from Japan who die young to the afterlife.
is under assault by the Demon King's army!
What's the point of getting reincarnated if I'm just going to get killed?
What might I lose?
I've got plenty.
No!
Brave hero, I pray that of the great many prospective heroes,
Look at what I'm wearing. I'm in a tracksuit.
Why would I care where someone stuck a pile of rocks?
I want to be an adventurer and fight the Demon King's army.
Huh? Registration fee?
Your support package is crap.
Don't call me a sh-NEET.
and gave me money.
Average across the board.
Of course, luck isn't a very essential stat for an adventurer.
i1Generic starting class, huh?
but maybe I can be an archpriest who heals her allies.
Nothing. Just shut up.
W-We're sorry!
i1I forgot her intelligence stat was below average.
i1And so our adventure began,
to stay in hotels in a place as affluent as Japan.
This city is the furthestis the furthest city from the Demon King's castle.
Thank you, Kazuma!
Thank you!
These guys are more than we can handle.
Let's try again after we get better equipment.
I've been defiled.
What did you mean by "help"?
Really?
No one's coming.
i1all thanks to joining the great Aqua's party!
Two at once?
As for the closer one...
I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.
Come forth from the abyss!
so now I can't move a muscle.
Just make do with some other magic from now on.
For real.
If your level is high enough to use explosion magic,
I can even go unpaid if need be.
Such mighty power would be wasted on a puny party of novice adventurers like us.
What kind of magician can only use magic once a day?!
Glad to have you aboard!
Very good work.
i1I want someone to search for my lost pet white wolf.
i1I want someone to teach my son swordsmanship.
Um...
M-My calling is that of a crusader.
Please let... Please let me...
i1What's with this knight?
No, don't misunderstand!
i1She's setting off my danger radar.
i1No, that isn't it!
I could learn to use explosion magic, too?
I've been looking for you.
That won't do, Darkness.
Excuse me! A cold one for the pretty lady over here!
Here I go. Watch carefully.
Hey, how about a little gamble?
Let's do this!
G-Give me back my panties!
H-Huh? That's strange.
You must let me join your party!
q2is this the person who you said came for an interview while Megumin and I were in the bath yesterday?
Aqua and I may not look like much,
What is it? What's coming?
What?
Charge!
and turn them into delicious meals!
Witness my ability as a crusader with your own eyes.
I'll hold them off! Run! Save him!
a fallen comrade!
i1Don't you start too!
i1How can a simple cabbage stir-fry be so tasty?
No, I'm just a solidly-built woman.
and preserved the freshness of the harvested cabbage with cold water.
An archpriest's water is practically holy!Golden showers, here we come.
an8Really?
So, Kazuma, please don't hesitate to use me as a decoy or shield from now on.
i1A total masochist.
Hopefully, I'm more adventurer-y with these new skills.
It's the type of thing some wannabe-aristocrat nouveau's son would wear.
Hey, what's the meaning of this?!
i1were apparently jam-packed with XP.
so I used up all the money I had!
I paid my tab, but I don't have any lunch money!
Where are all the quests?
Kazuma! This one! Let's do this one!
Cast your spell on whatever, and we can go home.
Uh, I guess so.
Explosion!
an8Explosion...
Listen.
Day after day after day after day!
I don't want to die!
Megumin?
You came alone, right into the trap. Like a rat.
and there's a whole town of adventurers behind her, so she's acting tough.
Huh?!
I know.
How about I make that crimson demon girl suffer a bit?
I sentence thee to death.
Hi, yes, I'm Kazuma.
I don't want to go, but I have no choice!
an8Let me go!
And you, crimson demon girl!
If you're able to make it all the way to me, I'll lift the curse.
Besides,
You can rely on me in times like these!
Huh?
A Nature's Beauty of victory!
Red rover, red rover!
I've had enough! I'm sick of being in debt!
I'll give it everything I've got this time!
an8Please!
My savings are starting to run outwhittle down to nothing, anyway,
The reward is 300,000 eris."
what I'm a goddess of from my name and appearance.
Too long!
Help me out, Kazuma-san!
Oh, that's true.
What kind of person do you two think I am?!uh, a chuuni.
The cage just made a sound no cage should ever make!
and we don't need any reward for this quest.
Th-That's right! You did all the work this time, after all!
Uh-huh! Kyouya's mine!
Now, chosen hero, depart on your journey with the Cursed Sword, Gram.
I've heard it before!
an8I'm sure they're taking me away to be sold.
an8I'm sure they're taking me away to be sold.
Seriously?
q2The Mitsurugi Kyouya upon whom you bestowed the Cursed Sword, Gram, and reincarnated in this world!
Huh?
i1Because she didn't want to get out of it.
What?!
but something about him makes me want to hit him.
Can I blow him up? Can I please blow him up?yes bby
Bye, then.
Kn-Knave!
Knave, knave, knave!
All adventurers, gather at the front gates and prepare for battle at once!Match to E3, E4
Him again?
You inhuman wretches!Match to E5
Don't act innocent, you damned son of a bitch!
That crazy crimson demon girl
Which means you must've had an accomplice!
Huh?
That's hilarious! Super hilarious!
Hey, I'm laughing here, you stupid undead!
He went "Gah!" and all.alt: He screamed in pain and everything.
You never start with the boss battle!
Call a priest!
No fair!
It appears that the force of my explosion has left speechless all who witnessed it.
All right, then, as promised...
Someone's bound to hit him if we all attack at once!
In fact, whip 'em out now!
Could you stop talking like that?!
which only makes it an ever more provocative state to publicly shame me in!
I can't say I don't like these kinds of surprises, but...
Hey, what's going on here?
His weakness is water!
I can use flood-class water magic.
Apologize for calling a water goddess a "lame goddess"!
All my followers in this world,
Answer my request, my prayer,
Sacred Create Water!
That's enough!
U-Um... Well...
Hey, wait!
For Sedol, the huge liar who said I wore my armor to hide my washboard abs.
You can hit me with it if you want, but only if you can!"
I'd love to have a drink with them.
Um... I-I'm sorry.
The radiance within me?
Ahem!
an8Nope. No problems.
But then I'll never get home!
Is it a check? It's a check, right?
Of course, defeating a leader of the Demon King's army is a big accomplishment,
Oh, I get it.
I'm a goddess, and you're making me sleep in a horse stable every night.
I'm sorry! I was completely out of line, so please, don't abandon me!
I'm sleepin' at the inn. It's cold!
I-I am too.
How about this?
The time has come for me to demonstrate which of us
I don't see.
i1Why does this masochistic crusader, who's always jumping at the chance to fight strong monsters,
Hey, can't you do something about that outfit?
Kazuma, look!
What?
topple this white world!
i1Killing Snow Sprites is a cinch!
So exciting...
I'll resist him,
So you're saying some jerk from Japan brought this freak to life here
Even if nobody is watching,
You try to go off with monsters willingly all the time!
You're forcing me to bow my head when I don't want to,
Huh?
Kazuma!
i1That's right.
Um, that is more than I can...
and a masochistic, perverted crusader who couldn't hit a wall at point blank.
but I did construction, random side jobs, and got forced into cabbage hunting.
May you be blessed once more with kind encounters in your new life.
Huh?! What goddess is spouting that nonsense?!
i1The face of the goddess in charge of that backwater hole is twitching!
Um,
Eris?!
Hey, Kazuma!
you can rip those bra pads right out
Aqua-senpai is as unreasonable as ever.
You were beheaded by General Winter.
The reward for killing those is 100,000 each!
No! Not this one!
and when summer comes, you'll make me lots of ice.
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!
Let's order something!
i1and smiled warmly as I revived.
Huh?
Huh?
I got plowed over by a tractor?
Stop! Stop!
Uh, right.
You like games, don't you?
I see...
Not a bad deal, don't you think?
Um, quick question.
we'll load some necessary info into your brain, so you'll learn the language instantly.
It's all the same, whatever you pick.
I've got a whole book of dead souls to guide, you know.
I shall perform your duties in your absence, Aqua-sama.
It's illegal! This has to be illegal!
Wait! Wait!
Goodbye, shut-in life! Hello, new world!
I get it, okay?! I'm sorry!
Okay, calm down, Goddess.
I don't really mind you calling me "Goddess,"You can call me "Goddess" if you like,
If you're lookin' for the guild registration desk, it's over there.
Oh, wait up.
Normally, we'd get some minimum equipment
Fine. It's my turn now.
Yes, the object of worship for the Religious Order of Axis: the goddess Aqua!
By the way, Eris is ranked beneath me.
Y-Yeah...
Um, we've brought the registration fee.
i1Something told me she didn't want to make eye contact with us.
This is your registration card.
This will calculate your current status.
Oh? Your luck is extraordinarily high.
Of course, luck isn't a very essential stat for an adventurer.
Y-You're right!
but maybe I can be an archpriest who heals her allies.
i1Now it's time for our adventure to begin!
I was just thinking.
Fair labor standards?
Good morning.
Guess again, princess.
Save meWhoa!
i1by overrunning settlements where they can find food.
i1They can even swallow farmers' goats whole.
Good thing these frogs can't move when they're eating.
Let's try again after we get better equipment.
the name of the brilliant and beautiful goddess Aqua will fall by the wayside!
You will rue the day you humiliated me
Gimmashish annuzzhah, mizzy!Hit me, baby! One more time!
What did you mean by "help"?
Swallow, slutface! Don't talk with your mouth full!
an8No way.
i1Immediate opening! We're a cozy, harmonious party.
Um...
Huh?
N-No!
What was that?!
This is a magic item that suppresses my mighty magical powers.
It just looks wicked cool.
They're basically all expert magicians,
Oh?
My mother is Yuiyui, and my father is Hyoizaburo!
So this girl's clan has a lot of good magicians, right?
Explosion magic is the strongest magic.
Kazuma, over there!
Target the frog in the distance with your magic.
Goddess?
God Requiem!
Any it strikes will perish!
a destructive force without equal!
Therefore, it consumes tremendous amounts of mana.
Wow! Check out this tadpole!
Whoa, it's huge!
For real.
before snagging all the archpriest spells.
but explosion magic is still the only magic I'll ever love!
for the low, low cost of food and sundries!
I'm begging you! Please don't abandon me!
110,000...
We nearly lost our lives for a reward of 36,000 each.
i1I want someone to search for my lost pet white wolf.
i1Requirements: must have high HP or confidence in their magic resistance!
Can't I go back to Japan?ur ded m8
i1Me so nervous my voice cracked, triple check.
I have anxiously awaited the arrival of someone such as yourself.
i1Why? To get my hands on the first-run limited edition
Yes, it was a tractor.
Stop! Stop!
Well, then...
Uh-huh...
On that note, we've got a great deal for you.
You've nothing to lose.
Nobody's expecting much from a shut-in gamer geekotaku anyway.
And I died outside my house, so I'm not a shut-in, either!
Yeah, sure, whatever. Just hurry it up.
Hurry up and decide?
That's right.
No way! Come on, now...
we shall send someone to retrieve you.
So if you're a goddess, use your godly powers or whatever to make my life as easy as possible!
you shall be the one to defeat the Demon King.
Now, go forth on your journey!
A fresh start in a fresh world!
Isn't there a bare minimum of starter equipment I should
i1Useless bitch.
And what's with the weird getup?
I want to be an adventurer and fight the Demon King's army.
G-Got it. I don't know anything about games,
but I guess that's how things work in worlds like this, right?
Are you ready to order?
Your support package is crap.
This must be fate. I saw earlier that you couldn't cover the fee, correct?
Uh, yes. I'm sorry.
Please choose your desired class based on your stats.
Except for your decently high intelligence, and...
Oh? Your luck is extraordinarily high.
Without further ado, welcome to our adventurer's guild, Aqua-sama.
i1Now it's time for our adventure to begin!
If you don't beat the Demon King, I'll never go home!
Who do you think I am?
It's almost noon.
This is as peaceful as it gets!
This city is the furthestis the furthest city from the Demon King's castle.
Thank you, Kazuma!
Thank you!
Let's try again after we get better equipment.
What did you mean by "help"?
and we'll have a whole line of people begging to join!
i1I got over my illness and became popular,
I happened to notice your recruitment poster.
When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.People really should read more Nietzsche. CR missed the quote entirely.
My lethal magic demolishes mountains,
Hey, what's wrong?!
I don't mind treating you,
a great catastrophe would surely befall this world.
Kazuma, over there!
Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark,
the ultimate offensive magic!
In short,
Y-You guys!
Wow! Check out this tadpole!
I can only use explosion magic.saw that coming lol
i1I'm completely convinced that this goddess is completely useless.
i1Frankly, I've had enough of useless bitches.
for the low, low cost of food and sundries!
Such mighty power would be wasted on a puny party of novice adventurers like us.
I went up four levels all at once.
It's not worth it.
I checked for other kinds of quests, but...
i1Requirements: rune knights or swordmasters only.
i1Looking for a practice partner for magical experiments.
My name is Darkness.
They were swallowed by Giant Toads, so the slime
It's worse than I had imagined.
i1This is just too stimulating for an adolescent virgin like myself!
i1Oh, I get it.
That's exactly right, Kazuma!
If you want to learn explosion magic,
Come, now, and walk the path of explosions with me!
Hey, calmcalm down, token loli.
Shall we continue where we left off yesterday?
Please let me join your party
i1Oh, shit!
You can't be so pushy.
The name's Chris. A thief, as you can see.
That's a bargain!
but this one's my favorite.
Here I go. Watch carefully.
Nature's Beauty...
Okay! The thief skills you chose are now yours!I know kung fu.
These never go for less than 400,000 eris.
That's dirty!
No!
Where have you been?
You missed my dazzling tricks.
which he used to steal her panties and all the money she had.
so I said I'd pay any price
And then he asked me to decide how much they'd be worth to sell!
allowing you to change jobs from "adventurer" to "pervert"?
You must let me join your party!
Wait, what?
i1I'll take care of this one later!
We're picking a fight with the strongest being in this world.
I shall obliterate his vile presence with our strongest of magics!
I'm kind of getting cold feet here.
All adventurers, assemble at the front gates immediately!
They're coming!
I'll protect you.
Cabbage, cabbage!
Please place any harvested cabbages in these humane, free-range, organic storage containers!Start removing memes.
Yes, you can!
I'd expect no less from a crusader.
an8Here!
an8Steal!
an8I'm looking forward to working with you.
Most of what you caught is actually lettuce.
Please, lend me some money!
We're the best party ever!
I want to test out my new staff!
I paid my tab, but I don't have any lunch money!
i1Could we all get on the same page?
so they're popping up in areas near the city
These quests are all suicide missions!
Surely nobody will complain if I obliterate that!
i1Left dead broke, useless bitch Aqua found a job and made herself useful.
an8Explosion!
That one was pretty good!
Nice explosion!
What a score!
Hey, Aqua, hate to break it to you, but...
To be bluntFrankly, I'm starting to think we should just give up on taking down the Demon King.
And whose fault is that? Why don't you try doing something goddess-like for once?
All you're good for is party tricks!
Don't take away my reason for being!
If you need to vent some stress,
o-on my castle every single day?!
i1The Demon King's vassal
If we're talking explosion magic...
If you don't have the nerve,
then stay in town, trembling with fear!
Stop bullshitting me!
I may have given myself up to evil, but I was once a knight.
Vassal, smassal, you big ol' tassel!
I know.
I'll purify you with my prayer!
Wh-What should I do, Kazuma?
You may do as you please with my body,
A lady knight imprisoned in a castle,
and then it'll be all over.
So...
You can rely on me in times like these!
So don't you worry
Hup!
I'm sick of working part-time in the shopping district!
The reward is 300,000 eris."
Maybe you could protect me?
We'll reel you in with the cage!
and blow the lake out of the water.
Oh, that's true.
You'll catch a chill if you're in the water too long!
You have yet to let me down, Kazuma.
The bars just bent!
Aqua, you okay?
Hey.
Quit it. You could've thrown in the towel on the quest whenever you wanted.
i1It looks like Aqua's been traumatized by this quest, too.
I will slay the Demon King and save the world.
I've heard it before!
Kyouya? Where are you going?!
Good Goddess!
q2We're getting enough funny looks as it is, carting around a woman on her knees in a beat-up cage.
Yeah...
Do something!
Who are you, anyway?destroyed m8
q2The Mitsurugi Kyouya upon whom you bestowed the Cursed Sword, Gram, and reincarnated in this world!
Huh?
By the way, where are you staying now, GoddessAqua-sama?
Um, in a stable.
Huh?
You two are...
All of you should travel with me, a swordmaster, from now on.
Hey, creeper alert?
Bye, then.
Let's do this!
Kn-Knave!
i1Who's the real knave? Me?
i1Or this cheater with a cursed sword picking on a noob with starter equipment?
W-Wait just a second!
What's more, there seem to be rumors that you're into getting girls covered in slime.
Hey, wait! Tell me who's spreading that around!
It's 300,000! 300,000!
Yes, I am the goddess Aqua!
Huh?
You...
Why haven't you come to the castle?!
Why?
Don't act innocent, you damned son of a bitch!
Which means you must've had an accomplice!
H-Hi, um...
Oh! I bet he's freaked out because your magic was more effective than he expected.
Now, let me hear your screams of despair!
You're not so bad, crazy girl!
Amusing...
The city's ace in the hole will be here soon!
Yeah! Demon vassal, shmassal, asshole, whatever!
Someone's bound to hit him if we all attack at once!
I-I'm sure
I say do it, if you've got the balls!
Is this the best shaming the demon army can muster?
Hardcore pervert?
C-Consider the time and place yourself, Kazuma!
I've already got a big, black monster publicly shaming me from the fore!
Create Water!
This is what I wanted to do!
Steal!
i1Think! We're up against a dullahan.
i1A dullahan's weakness...
Hit him! Hit him!
I can use flood-class water magic.
Apologize for calling a water goddess a "lame goddess"!
Answer my request, my prayer,
Soccer?
You're right.
They were all slain by that dullahan.
I'd love to have a drink with them.
Drinks on me?
You're late!
I believed in the radiance within you from the very start.
Kazuma-sama, gimme one, too!
It's a big problem for me if I can't fight strong enemies anymore!
It wasn't my fault!
Why all the fuss so early in the morning?
Kazuma, Kazuma!
How about this?
I don't see.
A Snow Sprite kill quest?
There are lots of Snow Sprites in the snowy plains.
They say that spring comes half a day sooner for each one you kill.
And that makes four!
I got eight of them.
I even gained a level.
One of the most powerful and most wanted monsters in the country,One of the specially designated monsters
But the only people stupid enough to run around outside in the winter
Bastard! I'll stick Napoleon up his ass!Say that as "na-pole-un" really fast.
Kazuma!
General Winter is merciful.
Are you a goddess of this world?
i1What's with this goddess?
I shall reincarnate you again in peaceful Japan, to an affluent family,
If you so wish it.
i1Seriously?!
I-If possible,
but now I feel like I pulled through by the skin of my teeth.
Do you know how it feels to have your eyelashes frozen solid every morning?
i1Maybe I even kinda liked it.
Oh, for real?!
I can't be revived again since I've been reincarnated once before!
Um,
An exception! I'll deem this an exception!
Sheesh, that girl's such a stickler.
i1despite the scarce food and harsh environment,
What?! No!
The reward for killing those is 100,000 each!
I'll pet you and love you,
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!
This is our little secret, okay?Match to above
What's with you?
If we run out of money, we can just take another quest.
or one with repulsive tentacles?
I'm quivering with excitement just imagining it!
an8Hey! A goddess is speaking to you! Listen with faithful reverence!
Clumsy as ever.
You're undead, and you have the nerve to set up a shop.
A goddess's servant learning a lich's skills?! Not on my watch, sh-NEET boy!
That's quite a feat.
With this, all my debts will be forgiven!
Heck, I'll even have money to spare!
I've never once caused anyone any harm,
So basically,
Even if we broke the barrier right now,
O-Okay,
It's all right. You can let go of my hand now.
so I'd appreciate it if you would let go.
I look away for one moment and this is what you do?
This is the place?
With this, we can make it through the winter without worry!
A child was confined here. An illegitimate child.
The noble had a weak constitution, and as illness took him,
Well, I think we can call it a day and do whatever.
This is great!
Are you all right?
I was looking forward to taking leisurely sips of it after my bath.
Turn Undead! Turn Undead! Turn Undead!
i1It can't be!
What's wrong with you, Megumin?!
Why did you come barging into this room?
If you don't, my pants and the carpet in this room are going to cop something nastybe in big trouble.
How can you try to relieve yourself alone?
Let go!
I'll shake you from behind
Um, this is a little embarrassing,
What are you chanting?
there's a public cemetery near that mansion.
A public cemetery?
I'm glad they've allowed you to live here.
Sorry for all the trouble, Wiz.
Kazuma! Food's ready! Get in!
Don't!
Huh?
i1We acquired a mansion,
i1I bet I couldn't have come to a place like this on my own.
Come right this way.
You too, big boys. Over here.
S-Sure.
Is this your first visit to our shop?
Well, then, I will explain how things work.
On the other hand,
i1If everyone was in a constant state of afterglow,
Uh, what are these?
Would that mean there's no restriction on your partner's age, either?
There are none.
Got it! Not a drop!
I'm home!
Be gladRejoice, Kazuma! Tonight's dinner is incredible!
and it even came with this amazing, top-quality liquor!
I can hardly believe that my eyes could feast on marbled red crab!
I would gladly resist,
i1I can't stop myself!
i1Gulp.
i1If I drink too much and sleep soundly, I won't be able to dream!
Please give me some, too!
I feel like a billion eris!
N-No! The crab is really good!
i1Which is more important? Your friends or the dream?
i1Crap, my heart is racing.
i1Argh, what do I do? What should I do?
i1The lantern went out?
i1Hey, whoa, whoa!
i1That would mean this is...
Do you understand what's going on right now?
If Aqua or Megumin found out about this...
I-Is it just me? Is my sense of decency perverted?
I may be naive and inexperienced, but I know when something's wrong!
Who're you calling a freak?
Hold still and let us annihilate you.
What's the big idea?
Kazuma has been charmed by that succubus and is under her control!
But...
I'll perform that succubus's last rites.
Bring it on!
Who could've undone both of those?
Yeah, yeah.
If only Mitsurugi-san were here right now.
No, we can't.
Not on hand.
Hey, wait!
Hurry it up! The big boy's gonna be here any second!
But do you really think I'm such a slave to my own desires?
Wha
Hey, Wiz!
You're really up for this, right?!
Hey, calm down. Try not to think about anything.
Sacred...
You just said the one thing even worse than mocking my name!
Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary,
When this is all over, I'm gonna marry her.
i1Hey, don't you dare jinx it! Just keep your mouth shut!
I can't wait to count through my reward!
We're dead.
A knight must never flee before her countrymen.
Huh?!
Yeah!
He passed peacefully, without a single regret in his life.
He died lonely and alone in this thing!
Is this his diary?
I'm fucked. It's gone berserk. It's fucking up everything.
Would you let me suck it out?
Now, then...
It's okay. I'll take responsibility.
Thank you, Kazuma-san.
Nobody fart!
Wait.
Just let this heap
You only get one chance.
Don't suck out too much, okay?!
You've taken a ton of my mana. Like, a lot.
A little more... Just a little more.
Adventurer Satou Kazuma.
What? You're not getting a reward?
Hey!
How the heck are we going to slay the Demon King now?!
Please let...
and I'm the generic starting class.
It would be my pleasure!
I'd better take care not to spend mine on any weird skills.
I'll teach you everything you want!
Huh?
Please let me join your party
The name's Chris. A thief, as you can see.
They don't take many points to learn, and they're useful.
Excuse me! A cold one for the pretty lady over here!
Hey! My wallet!
What? But he's still new to this!
Oh...
Yeah, I won't need this.
Okay! The thief skills you chose are now yours!I know kung fu.
You asked for it, so don't start crying when you lose!
G-Give me back my panties!
so I said I'd pay any price
We're picking a fight with the strongest being in this world.
User of the finest magic the crimson demons possess!
Is it a monster attack?
They're gonna be rough this year.
and turn them into delicious meals!
a fallen comrade!
i1watching me stripped of my garments, their very souls aroused!
i1I refuse to accept this.
She boosted the morale of all the adventurers,
an8Here!
an8Really?
Have you now seen the power of the crimson demon bloodline?
Most importantly, you saw my abilities as a crusader.
Once again, I look forward to working with you!
Satou Kazuma-san.
but you are, in fact, dead.
Huh? Then what happened?
I died of shock?!
You have two choices:
so you can't do anything sexual, either.
What?
That won't be an issue.
All right, stand there and don't leave the magic circle
There's no way I can beat the Devil King!
Times like these call for guilds.
Huh?
If you're lookin' for the guild admission desk, it's over there.
Hey.
Why were you a shut-in otaku with no friends or even a girlfriend before?
I'm in the Eris Sect, though.
Here.
He didn't even believe that I'm a goddess.
A believer in my subordinate took pity on me
and lent me money...
so please work hard to raise your level.
Like this?
so please choose your desired occupation based on your stats.
with the exception of decently high intelligence.
I'd recommend becoming a merchant or something similar.
The weakest job, huh?
but in my case, maybe I'll be an arch priest who heals her allies.
It's the adventurer's life for us starting today, Kazuma!
No need! It's not that!
I was just thinking.
But it is true that you're a goddess.
You look super desperate!
I'll bury her later, before I head home!
Kazuma!
Thank you!
If the followers of Axis see me sullied like this,
I'll lose their devotion!
If it gets out that I backed down from a lowly frog,
and looks forward to her post-bath dinner
God Blow!
"God Blow" is a lethal fist that carries a goddess's rage and sorrow!
There's no way the two of us can take them on alone.
You've got me here, so allies
Nobody's coming.
I mean, you might have an advanced job class,
I happened to notice your recruitment poster.
the strongest of all offensive magic!
Then show me thine resolve to peer into the ultimate abyss with me!
Hey, what's wrong?!
This is the magic item that suppresses my mighty magical powers.My mighty magical powers are suppressed by this magic item.
I'm sorry! Please don't pull on it!
Actually, it'll hurt if you just let go,
Ow! My eye!
Hyoizaburo!
She's an arch wizard for sure.
It's an advanced job class that commands powerful offensive magic!
Target the frog in the distance with your magic.
What do you mean "former"?!
Watch this, Kazuma!
"God Requiem" is a goddess's requiem of love and sorrow!
As expected of a goddess...
She put her life on the line to buy us time.
The time of awakening cometh.
Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary,
a destructive force without equal!
Amazing...
So this is magic?
Megumin!
I never expected a frog to pop up so close by.
Don't get eaten!
That's information I didn't want to know.
Even I didn't learn all the arch priest spells
I highly suspect this goddess is also completely useless.
It's fine, even if you are puny or novices!
No other parties will take me anymore!
Toying with such a little girl, then discarding her?
I checked the other quests just in case, but...
Um...
I have anxiously awaited the arrival of someone such as yourself.
What in the world happened to them?
Her eyes are scaring me...
while the other can only use her magic once per day,
and I'm the lowest job class.
As such,
I was so worn out, I slept until noon.
Basically, if I have you teach me,
No, there certainly is not!
L-Little girl?
I refuse.
Such a swift decision!
She's dangerous!
This is the thief skill "Steal."
It's a fine item that wouldn't go for less than 400,000 eris.
These rocks!
Konosuba!
so I said I'd pay any price
Uh-huh.
they don't just sit back and let themselves be eaten.
Kazuma.
Darkness, you...
those who have fallen?!
As a knight, I must learn from her example.
Oh, blackness shrouded in light...
It's no surprise that those cabbages had a tough time breaching your iron-clad defenses.
and preserved the freshness of the harvested cabbage with cold water.
Nature's Beauty!
Thank you.
Yes. I've never taken a direct hit with such firepower before.
When you erase your presence with the Lurk skill
I can use swords with either hand,
Yes, pleased to have you.
and I know you rustle around beside me at night sometimes,
Why?
Covered in slime?!
Kazuma! This is it! Let's do this one!
A kill quest for a giant beast called Black Fang!
What?
Look, this is incredible! It's such fine work!
Just use your magic on whatever and let's go back.
commuted to that abandoned castle every day and kept unleashing explosion magic on it.
I'd give that one 60 points, I think.
of each day's explosion magic.
and yet the delayed vibrations of the air seem to strikestroke my skin.
It could be fun to acquire it in the future, whenif I can afford to.
That's the situation, so come up with some profitable business that's simple to do.
I wouldn't mind if you verbally abused me instead.
Emergency! Emergency!
Um, I'm still a novice.
Are you making a fool of me?
so don't use your explosion magic on it again.
Yes.
I don't care if you're one of the Devil King's leaders!
You will die in one week.
Your precious ally
Wh-What should I do, Kazuma?
I don't want to go.
Stop! Don't go!
If you go alone, you'll use your magic on some small fry,
taking care of a useless goddess... caring for a
I've had enoughall I can take of living in debt!
The reward is 500,000 eris."
No, you shut-in NEET!
That's what this is about?
By no means did we come here to abandon this worthless goddess in the lake.
She'll be able to touch and purify the water from inside the safety of the cage.
How's purifying the lake coming along?
If you need to go to the bathroom, let us know!
It sounds like she's doing fine.
M-Me, neither. either
K-Kazuma!
Kazuma! Kazuma-san!
Since the alligators showed up,
Hey, Aqua.
It looks like a quest traumatized Aqua yet again.
Can we beat that thing?
many people could be injured, or lose their lives.
Kyouya is mine!
A used-up goddess is being transported along...
Kyouya? Where are you going?!
The inside of this cage is my sanctuary.Inside this cage is my sanctuary.
Yeah...
She's just like I used to be...
Huh?
The Mitsurugi Kyouya who received this Cursed Sword Gram
I've sent along many people,
It has been a while, Aqua-sama.
Then you locked her in a cage and dunked her in a lake?!
What in the world were you thinking?!
Aqua-sama, I don't know how this man won you over,
This jerk just says whatever he wants.
What's this?
A crusader and arch wizard?
That's right, you disgusting man! Coward!
Huh?
The cage repair fee is 200,000 eris.
The next time I see that man,
They call you "Kazuma the Brute."
Wh-Wh-Where did my cursed sword go?
Damn it!
I've kept this to myself until now,
What?
is still attacking my castle every single day!is still coming to my castle every single day!
Did you not have the backbone to seek retribution for your ally's death?!
That's hilarious! Super hilarious!
Call a priest!
I can't get rid of them, no matter how many times I use Turn Undead!
Damn, there are too many of them!
What an ideal situation!
q2It appears every last person here has been left speechless
I'll blow them all away later.
All right, then, as promised...
you intend to use those strong arms of yours to lewdly torture
This girl is my ally!
What a disappointment.
a little at a time for a while now.
Bring it on!
Darkness!
What would his weakness have been in an RPG?
Leave it to me!
If I could see them once more,
She's drunk already!
we never would have defeated the dullahan!
I'm not really used to this, but it's pretty nice.
I award you 300 million eris.
Um, Kazuma-san...
and the cost of compensation is 340 million, huh?
in order to escape from this good-for-nothing world.
I can't help it!
All of you should praise me, praise me, and spoil me rotten!
You attention whore!
Pay off your debts on your own.
What'll we do today?
was distributed to every adventurer who participated.
There's no reason for anyone to go hunting dangerous winter monsters
when their coin pouches are full.
Personally, I gladly welcome it.
They don't sound all that strong, based on the name,
Hey, wait.
I'm a little cold, but that in itself is...
Explosion!
Oh, nice going!
It would've been a little cooler if you weren't buried in the snow, though.
What the heck?
Why doesn't everybody do this?
Huh?
One of the specially designated monsters
but he will likely be beyond my capabilities, and I'll be shamed...
Stupid!
But the only ones strolling around outside town
The Winter Shogun is mercifulgenerous.
Everyone, toss your weapons aside and bow down!
What a reward!
Are you a goddess of this world?
I-If possible,
and I'd be even happier in a life where a beautiful girl is my childhood friend!
explosion girl who fell flat every time she used magic,
The previous world's game balance was beyond terrible, if you ask me.
H-Huh?
You've been reborn once already, so according to the laws of Heaven,
I don't mind if they're pads.
Kazuma!
I've already given it a name!
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!
She mourned my death so much
A righteous, beautiful girl who's not an oddball!
I brought you back to life today, Kazuma!
What sort of monster would be good next?
I don't have any choice!
Hand over that raiment, then!
Hey, what're you talking about?
What do you take me for?!
and you're running a shop?!
I see she hasn't changed.
You set up a shop even though you're an undead,
Stop acting like a spiteful sister-in-law.
This conversation isn't going anywhere.
even among the other leaders,
With this, all my debts will be forgiven!
He was the sort who would often roll his own head down by my feet
Strike! In so many ways, a total strike!
I see. Depending on how it's used,
Fine. Absorb as much as you can.
Come on, what's the matter?
Acquisition complete!
so I'd appreciate it if you would let go.
You're so mean...
Wiz is apparently known as a famous wizard in our city,
The aristocrat had a weak constitution, and when he died from illness,
It's no surprise that it was a little dusty... Huh?
I'm going to go look around the mansion
q2And I thought... we could go to the bathroom... together...
Hey, Megumin,
look over there and cover your ears for a minute.
If you want, there's an empty bottle lying over there!
You just blurted out something outrageous!
Hey, Megumin, hurry up!
but we've got a bigger problem closing in!
I thought that might happen, so I brought this.
Why did so many evil spirits gather there?
So the spirits had nowhere to go
But constantly going all the way to the graveyard was a huge pain.
So... I... did...
Talk about stirring up trouble and taking the credit!
I'm sure she won't be lonely anymore.
I'm begging you, please don't cause any more mischief.
If you don't, your long-awaited lunch will get cold!
q2No matter how absurd the situation, they must never give in.
Hey, wait.
But we still have lots of problems left to solve...
Okay.
Huh?!
He wasn't an adventurer?!
Y-Yes?
Many adventurers live in stables, correct?
Wonderful! It's beyond wonderful!
Are the men in this city all right?
It can be anything or anyone,
For real?!
Would the rights to one's likeness and so forth cause problems?
I-Is that okay?
Yeah, there's no problem if it's in a dream!
They said it's to thank their daughter's party members for always looking out for her!
I can hardly believe I'm laying my eyes on marbled red crab!
I can't stop myself!
Please give me some, too!
Everyone drink up!
To think you could mimic that movement!
Stop! Don't give me such a genuine smile!
Yes. There was never any need to worry about anything in the first place.
The lantern flame went out?
I always imagined she had a sexy body, but this is better than I imagined.
If that happens, why don't we all just get in together?
What's wrong with you?
Think about how much you're bothering the neighbors!
Yeah, you're always strange in general.
This feels new in all sorts of ways.
I know I set you to be inexperienced,
wrong...
I'm gonna go complain!
What the heck? This is strange. Really strange.
I'll perform that succubus's last rites.
Bring it on!
The succubus flewran away, huh?
Konosuba!
Hey, talk to me already.
You don't have any memory of it since you were being controlled
It was sort of an accident.
That's the story I'm going with!
A convenient explanation fell into my lap,
Still, you were kind of overbearing at the time, and a little scary,
but it wasn't bad.
Brush up on your common sense a little more.
A knight must never run away,
Kazuma!
No, they can't.
You're as stubborn as ever, Darkness.
We have that.
Why is she so famous?
Huh?!
And don't call her a "destitute shopkeeper." I feel bad for her.
She made a name for herself as a master arch wizard once upon a time.
Right!
Hey, Darkness. I know how stubborn you are,
Don't tell the others.
Oh, uh, sure...
I am a knight.
Okay...
A certain arch priest's selfish whims
annoy me and make me want to slap her,
Don't call me by that name!
Will we be okay? Can we handle this?
Here it comes!
What was that?!
Explosion!
All crew, please evacuate immediately.
It's hopeless! Run for it!
Huh? Hey!
I want to go home!
A goddess seals away an evil power or something?
I could use teleportation magicI could use teleportation magic to send it somewh
Would you let me suck it out?
I won't say something as tasteless as "Suck what out?"
play dumb at a time like this.
I'm sorry! Drain Touch!
and it's still detecting the savory aroma of danger.
So there was no point in sending the coronatite away!
For real?!
Megumin!
I'm ready anytime.
You only get one chance.
However,
Oh, are they coming to deliver my compensation in person?
You will come with me.
Hey, are you listening?!
What're we gonna do?!
Thanks for watching!
You never show any mercy, do you, Kazuma?
W-Well...
i1I guess my high luck stat came in handy.
K-Kazuma-san!
I'm using this money to escape from life in the stables once and for all!
Wearing a tracksuit breaks the whole fantasy feel, after all.
I learned a generic starting spell, too.
i1Could we all get on the same page?
Huh? What the heck?
so there's been a sharp decline in available quests.
if he's an undead, I'll take him down facile, no hassle!1010
Look at this one! It's beautiful!
Well, I don't wanna get sued.
Kinda eerie.
I'll use that!
in accordance with the principles of all creation.
i1Left dead broke, useless bitch Aqua found a job and made herself useful.
an8Explosion!
I'm sure you will.
Like guiding the hero, or buying time by sealing the Demon King
Emergency! Emergency!
Wh-Which one of you is the deranged maniac who keeps casting that explosion spell
i1The Demon King's vassal
then stay in town, trembling with fear!
We leave your wimpy little, pitiful, backwater town in quiet peace,
I am Megumin!ily never change megumin
She hasn't cast Explosion yet today,
An archpriest?
I know.
It seems I'm unharmed.
You should have done as I said.
Wh-What should I do, Kazuma?
Look at that dullahan's filthy eyes, hidden beneath his helmet!
I'm going to the castle.
You know I'm going with you.
It's no big deal! Even though it was!
Why?!
All of you are this city's last bastion of hope.
we'll need some heavy-hitting magic...
If we need firepower, we have her, don't we?
right here and now!
Right!
but do you really think I'm a woman of such rigid adherence to my own desires?
Don't tell the others.
Protecting the livelihoods of my countrymen is both my duty and my honor.
You did it, Megumin.
We're evacuating!
No, no matter how sturdy I may be, it's unlikely I'll get through this unscathed.
I'm charging in!
If I can't repay that debt now, I'm done for as a human being!
Yeah!
Don't be scared! We'll follow her, too!
Come on, you useless goddess!
Take a look at that.
What's this?
Telling me to create a mobile fortress on this pittance?
Um, Kazuma-san...
Dad, Mom,
I'm sorry! Drain Touch!
You shut-in NEET! What are you doing in this state of emergency?!
I fell behind earlier, but that was... Yes!
I think you've absorbed more than enough already.
My ultimate destructive magic...
Oh, are they coming to deliver my compensation in person?
That's definitely...
Oh, God.
You root of all evil.Match to later
She's likely to bring back a suicide quest.
All right.
I would like to have the water purified.
Oh, please.
Go accept it, then.
I feel like some rare monster, captured and on its way to market.
Aqua! If anything happens, just shout!
We'll reel you in with the cage!
Says the girl who lets it rip every chance she gets.
You, Aqua, and the Queen of England.
I still haven't seen any alligators.
The cage! The cage sounds like it's gonna break!
i1It looks like Aqua's been traumatized by this quest, too.
That's the legendary Ancient Dragon.
Only he could defeat the Ancient Dragon with a single blow!
i1I promised her that I would.
Is that you, Good Goddess?!
Huh?
i1Did this bitch seriously forget that she's a goddess?
Huh?
i1You barely even know the bitch.
What?
Um, in a stable.
i1Don't do that. I'd die, too.
i1This guy got that "Cursed Sword Gram" or whatever when he was reincarnated
Excuse me. You're in my way.
i1I can see where this is going.
Sure, you're on.
You two in this guy's party?
Only Kyouya can use that cursed sword!
i1Didn't she just say it was 200,000?
In exchange, I'll buy you the finest sword
You root of all evil.Match to first line
Yes, I am the goddess Aqua!
Why haven't you come to the castle?!Match to E5
We're not casting any explosion magic on you anymore.
Ow!
an8That's so pathetic!
Hey, Kazuma, something's up! It's not working!
Isn't this city where beginners start? Isn't it?
There's no need for me to fight you myself.
N-No!
He did go "Yow!" and all. I think it's super effective.
Not when they're all moving everywhere.
Megumin!
Now!
i1Aqua's magic isn't enough to deliver a fatal blow.
It appears you wish to die first.
you intend to make an example of me by pinning me down with those strong arms
Darkness, stand down!
Huh?
You freaking hardcore pervert!
C-Consider the time and place yourself, Kazuma!
Nothing, damn it!
I can't say I don't like these kinds of surprises, but...
This is what I wanted to do!
i1Undead monsters' weaknesses are...
Farewell, heroic yet foolish crusader!
Stop that, you pests!
Hit him! Hit him!
Hey, what's going on here?
His weakness is water!
I may be weakened,
U-Um... Well...
a game where you handle the ball with only your feet, not your hands!
Leave it to me!
No, wait, that isn't what I...
I have something to tell all of you.
We won thanks to my skills, so we should go 9010.
Nope, because I was never a NEET!
Welcome to the afterlife.
Your life was a short one,
but you are, in fact, dead.
Just one question...
I died of shock?!
What's the deal with this girl I've never met before?
Your family rushed to the hospital,
Heaven isn't the dreamy place you all imagine it to be.
There's nothing to do there but bask in the sun for all eternity.
Uh, right.
This world,
died in other worlds there with their bodies and memories intact?"
And the people of the parallel world
Will I be able to speak this other world's language?
With the kind support of us gods,
but all of the abilities and equipment here are totally broken!
I-I'm not an otaku!
Not like that matters, just hurry it up.
"Hurry up and decide," huh?
I shall take over your job from here on out, Aqua-sama.
Wait! Wait!
I can really start anew in this world!
What are you talking about?!
Hey, wait.
Is that right, you reckless punk?
Welcome to the gates of Hell!
but I guess that's how it works in worlds like this, right?
In that case, you'll first need to pay the registration fee.
Do you have any money?
Are you ready to order?
I'm Aqua.
Yes, the object of worship for the Religious Order of Axis: the goddess Aqua!
It keeps track of how many monsters you've vanquished.
so please work hard to raise your level.
Now, one at a time, please hold your hand over this crystal.
Satou Kazuma-san, is it?
No, wait a second!
With no monsters, there's no need for anyone to give us any fetch quests.
Say,
That's right.
And so our adventure began,
so sleeping in a stable is normal.
Yeah!
If you want me to save you,
Let's do this after we put better equipment together!
Regret that you ever stood in my path
AnyAnything it strikes will perish!
N-Now that I've had a good look, I think frogs are pretty cute.N-Now that I have a good look, I think frogs are pretty cute.
Let's recruit more allies!
You've got me here, so allies
Well, that was a lie.
Please cut it out!
Hey!
I'd prefer you called me by name.
Well, go ahead and order something, "arch wizard."
but this time for sure!
She put her life on the line to buy us time.
Don't get eaten!
Whoa, it's huge!
I can't.
Huh?
then when we get a chance, let's meet up somewhere
I'd be fine with going unpaid if need be.
I'll show you I can even endure that slimy act we used those frogs for!
You really do get stronger just by defeating some monsters.
We nearly lost our lives for a reward of 36,000 each.
We are!
I wouldn't really recommend it, though...
They were swallowed by Giant Toads, and the mucus
I'll charge to the front line,
so please use me as a shield!
Her face is too close!
It's not just her abilities. She's hopeless to the core.
Exactly!
Her face is too close.
Hey, calm... calm down, little girl!
One that has value and doesn't take many points to learn.
This one seems like a relatively competent person.
How about it?
If you act now, I'll do it for the cost of a drink.
Excuse me! One ice-cold drink for this lady over here!
Konosuba!
If it's successful, you can take possession of your opponent's property.
Huh...
The skills you learned from me should be displayed there.
Whatever I steal from you, don't cry about it!
Oh, Kazuma.
Where have you been?
Wait, what's with her?
Actually...
He said if I didn't, they'd be revered within his family as an heirloom from now on!
Wait, what?
Kazuma, Kazuma...
Huh?
How could I ever abandon
She's a model knight!
Incredible!
Could I possibly resist the urge to unleash explosion magic
Nature's Beauty!
Really?
Steal!
J-Just imagining it makes me tremble with excitement!
Well, that's about what I'd expect from elementary magic.
W-Well...
Most of what you caught is actually lettuce.
q2About how much was your reward from our last quest?
Konosuba!
Kazuma, allies sure are great, huh?
They're not on the same page at all!
Huh? What's going on?
After one shot, I can't move anymore.
Is she
going to make me tag along for this every day?
my new daily routine with Megumin began.
commuted to that abandoned castle every day and kept unleashing explosion magic on it.
plosion!
The future, huh?
Anything but my recovery magic!
Don't take away my reason for being!
Your verbal lashings are pretty nasty.
Why you little...
All adventurers, please arm yourselves at once
Hey now, that's no laughing matter!That's no laughing matter!
Huh? M-Me?!
Um, I'm still a novice.
N-No!
Firing explosion magic at you continuously was a strategy
so don't use your explosion magic on it again.
It doesn't appear to be serious.
Listen, crimson demon girl.
I won't give in to a mere curse!
I won't give in, but...
Look at Dullahan's obscene eyes, hidden beneath his helmet!
Huh?!
but don't think you'll be free to do as you please with my heart!
Megumin and I were so excited.
Nature's Beauty of victory!
I've had enoughall I can take of living in debt!
P-Please!
This is one pitiful self-proclaimed goddess.
Please!
"There's a place where a Manticore and a Griffin are fighting over territory.
The monsters will move to a different habitat if the lake is purified,
This quest is perfect for me!
Are you actually capable of purifying water?
You fool.
Surely you can tell what I'm a goddess of from my name and appearance.
Water!
Five minutes?
Please, I'm begging you!
I think I know a way you can purify the lake safely, but...
Konosuba!
I feel like a teabag being used to make dashi soup stock.
But I'll apologize, so please don't do that.
Don't you dare.
It looks like the purification is complete.
but in the abyss of death, I met a lovely goddess
Kyouya!
My Goddess!
Hang in there, me...
In fact, get out of there already!
What?!
I've been having more fun than I've ever had before,
He doesn't even know Aqua all that well!
What's this?
Also, these girls are "excellent""wonderful"?
seen the slightest
All of you should travel with me, a sword master, from now on.
What should I do?
but something about him makes me want to hit him.
Can I blow him up? I want to blow him up.Can I blow him up?
q2Sorry, but I can't leave Aqua-sama in this environment.
I knew it.
C-Coward!
Huh?
The Cursed Sword Gram is for this embarrassing guy's use alone.
So, what will it be?
after deducting the cost of the broken cage, is 100,000 eris.
God Blow!
Eh? Uh, sure...
Excuse me!
Kyouya!
No!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma-san and his party in particular,
as quickly as possible, please!
You bastards...
Until now, I've been able to settle for unleashing my magic on empty plains,
You?!
G-Gosh, um...
with no idea that we easily dispelled his curse after he left?
Th-That's not it!
Why should the boss be the one you fight first?
Slaughter everyone in the city!
No fair!
I'm grateful! I'm deeply grateful, Kazuma!
She did it! The crazy crimson demon girl did it!
She's crazy in the head, and so is her name, but she pulls through when it counts!
I'm sorry.
I'll blow them all away later.
q2I didn't think you'd actually annihilate my underlings!
Aqua's magic isn't enough to deliver a fatal blow.
We can create a blind spot if we all attack at once.
How dare you?
and make an example of me in front of everyone!
In fact, show me what you've got!
He's been shaving away at my armor
he's left only parts of my armor intact,
I'm not doing anything!
I'm not doing anything!
What are you trying to do, boy?!
the water goddess Aqua commands you.
Are you an idiot?
Don't hold back.
It's not a problem!
You won't earn it!
caused substantial damage to the outer walls...
I just ask that you pay a portion...
The reward is 300 million,
and the cost of compensation is 340 million, huh?
in order to escape from this good-for-nothing world.
Feeling guilty yet? Then give me the life I deserve!
from our rewards every time we return from a quest?! It's like a payday loan on crack!
When I woke up in my straw, my eyelashes were frozen solid!
Praise me, praise me, and spoil me rotten!
Wait! I'm sorry!
It lumbers around, trampling everything in its path.
So we're taking that quest? Lemme go get ready!
You look like a dumb kid going bug-catching in the middle of winter.
i1I'll kill the Snow Sprites she caught, too.
Hey, you okay?
i1Sh-She's playing dead.
What is it this time?!What-ever is it?!
Even if nobody is watching,
and provide for you a life of comfort.
I thought it was all over,
Because my life up until now has been total shit!
I beat a boss, but got slammed with a debt deep enough to warrant organ sales for it.
P-Please wait a moment!
an8Pads?!
Goodness gracious,
Kazuma!
Come on.
Why don't I send you to meet Eris right now, then?!
Huh?
It was quite a splendid slice.
i1are allowed to remain alive and active.
I'm taking him home and using him as a refrigerator!
No! Not this one!
Actually, I'm feeling peckish, myself.
You attention whore!
How about this?
Just imagining a pack of wild beasts making a mess of me...
It's a massive fortress that moves at high speed.
They don't sound all that strong, based on the name,
Hey, are you all right?
Killing Snow Sprites is totally delectable!
Sh-She's playing dead?...
Kazuma!
I'm sure this monster plans to use his position as shogun
Sprites pick up the subconscious thoughts of the people they encounter
Prostrate yourself! Prostrate yourself before him!
Come on!
You try to go off with monsters willingly all the time!
Welcome to the afterlife.
She's not like that useless goddess!
Seriously?!
I-If possible,
This is a reward for trying my hardest, right?
You said it!
was just an arrogant good-for-nothing.
adventure with those girls a little longer...
Eris?!
I'll confiscate her breast pads
Pads?!
You are called Kazuma-san, correct?
Huh? Oh, uh, yes!
Come on.
Say something.
Okay, retreat!
No! Not this one!
I've already given it a name!
We'll sleep together on hot, restless nights.
Actually, I've worked up an appetite.
She mourned my death so much
What sort of monster would be good next?
On second thought, I should've reincarnated in Japan.
It looks like it would burn better than a tracksuit!
Let go, you shut-in NEET!
Whoa, wait!
Listen up, Aqua.
Hey! Are you listening to me?!
Hey! What are you thinking, Kazuma?!
Liches love to hang out in gloomy, dismal places.
The whole lot of them are basically related to slugs!
Curse you! Curse you! This is what you get!
I'm sorry!
This conversation isn't going anywhere.
By the way, I heard you defeated Verdia-san.
His skill with the sword was supposed to be quite impressive,
saying you're a leader of the Devil King's army...
Please wait, Aqua-sama!
That's what the Devil King asked of me!
All of my skills can only be used on an opponent.
Aqua, sorry, but would you do it?
It's a skill that absorbs an opponent's health and magic,
please excuse me.
Is it just my imagination, or is Wiz kind of see-through now?
You could call me an anti-undead expert!
We've decided the room arrangements, and we've carried in our luggage,
What's wrong?! Hey, Aqua, what happened?!
Are you all right?
But when I came back to my room, as you can see,
I see. Goodnight, then. See you tomorrow.
Let go!
Why do I have to sing in the middle of the night, in front of a bathroom?!
Crimson demons don't use the bathroom.
Konosuba!
by how new evil spirits settled in, no matter how many were exorcised.
Why did so many evil spirits gather there?
and settled in that vacant mansion instead.
Well, I need to tend to the shop, so I'll be heading back for the day.
Aqua, we're out of wood for the fireplace.
Darkness! That's not fair!
I'm level 21,
What's with that look in your eyes, like you're staring at someone pitiful?
These guys are Keith and Dust, two adventurers I got to know recently.
Okay.
Yes.
So, I believe males get pent-up in various ways.
Or it's possible the person he tried to mess around with
If everyone could be in a constant state of afterglow,
We also have customers who want to try it from a female perspective.
Really?
How much can you actually configure?
They wouldn't. It's a dream, after all.
and unleash my explosion magic after I've eaten!
Crack!
Crack!
Everyone drink up!
To think you could mimic that movement!
Goodnight, everyone.
but etiquette is important.
Hey, whoa, whoa! No, wait...
The moon really is pretty toni
I always imagined she had a sexy body, but this is better than I imagined.
Maybe I shouldn't have requested a beautiful older woman with a hot body?
No, um, uh... I have so many questions that my brain can't quite keep up.
Oh, this is a dream, so I guess it's no problem if you make noise.
I'm the one who's usually creeped out by you,
This is not right!
Hurry...
Intruder! Show yourself!
Huh?
Aqua's voice?
An intruder got caught in my barrier, and now she's immobilized...
I'm positive she was after you, Kazuma.
Just be good and let us destroy you.
Just resign yourself.
and failure to sneak in covertlybreak in that this has come to pass.
He's been blurting out things about dreams and settings and so forth, so I'm sure of it!
Konosuba!
It was sort of an accident.
Who the heck pranked us like this?
Huh?
That's asking a lot...
The crazy one.
Otherwise, I'll prove just how crazy I am
I'm a qualified adventurer, so I've come to help.
It's the shopkeeper!
We can win this! We can win this now!
but set aside your hopeless fetishes for now and join me at the edge of the road
A-Ahem.
I must protect the inhabitants of this land.
but that, at the very least, is how I feel.
Do you have some reason for that?
Lala What was that?
I'm the daughter of the Dustiness family, which governs this area.
You're up for this, right?!
If I should fail, let's return to the soil together on good terms.
Hey! Is your love for explosion magic the real deal?!
What was that?!
You just said the one thing
I'll show you what real explosion magic is!
Explosion!
Yes, I'm Kazuma.
Huh? Hey!
Huh?!
Found it!
Take a look at that.
Absurd."
Oh, no!
Still, I feel kind of relieved. I'm satisfied.
A goddess seals away an evil power or something?
Um, Kazuma-san...
I may not look it, but I apparently have good luck!
Is this where you were, Darkness?
I'm out of magic.
Wait!
Konosuba!
Drain Touch is most effective when
This might be bad. It's bad.
Our battle with the mobile fortress, Destroyer, ended.
Knights are coming from the imperial capital!
I pray that if I ever get another chance to go to a parallel world,
where I can actually achieve something cool!
Kazuma!
The Destroyer was created by an ancient magical kingdom, correct?
No, they can't.
The crazy one.
It's the shopkeeper!
A-Ahem.
I'm sure the residents of this city won't pay me any mind,
I see.
Hey, hey, it's too soon! Too soon!
Sacred...
appear now as an intangible distortion!
You did it, Megumin.
A knight mustn't run away before her countrymen.
I'm charging in!
Huh?!
All to protect the city!
If I can't repay that debt now, I'm done for as a human being!
Go!
Come on! Whoever's in charge, show yourself!
Let's go home. Let's go home and try hard again tomorrow...
Not only did he not turn undead,
No, he must have had attachments!
Telling me to create a mobile fortress on this pittance?
Oh, no!
All right, I've decided.
The coronatite is out of control.
But I don't have enough magic!
I won't say something as tasteless as "Suck what out?"
It's okay. I'll take responsibility.
Is this where you were, Darkness?
Hey, I don't have time to deal with you right now!
I'm ready anytime.
No! I'm not trying to sound like some performer!
Drain Touch is most effective when
Hey! Not you, too!
I feel it, I feel it!
She's not going to detonate, is she?
Frenzied blaze clad in night...
My reluctant party of horrible allies...
Killing the Demon King is totally out of the question now!
Oh, God.
I pray that if I ever get another chance to go to a parallel world,
The fire's dying!
an8Hey! A goddess is speaking to you! Listen with faithful reverence!
Welco
i1Wiz might be a lich, but she's as nice as can be.
i1Cue some circumstances,
Um...
That's right.
I'm sorry!
an8Damn this, and this, and this, and this!
I did it, Kazuma!
q2Look, Wiz, if you're one of the Demon King's vassal's, we adventurers can't leave you be.
The King only asked me to put a barrier around his castle!
and there's no bounty for defeating me, either!
Not sure how that works, so I'll annihilate you, just in case.
but pleaseonly if I put a barrier around his castle for him, please.
Strike! In so many ways, a total strike!
What skill is an undead planning to use on me?
W-Well...
and can then distribute that energy to others.
i1I can't tell which is the lich and which is the goddess.
A-Aqua-sama?
Is Wiz-san here?
Are you all right?
It was empty!
I'm going to comb every inch of this mansion
Let go.
What are you suggesting I do with that empty bottle?!
You won't get your way!
Bring it on!
Damn evil spirits!
I'll sic our mad-dog goddess on you all later, damn it!
The place where we first met Wiz?
So the spirits had nowhere to go and settled in that vacant mansion instead.
You remember that time we exorcised the cemetery in Wiz's stead?
So... I... did... it.
We won't accept the special reward from the guild.
Yes.
Sorry for all the trouble, Wiz.
Say hello to the others for me.
Kazuma! Food's ready! Get in!
Why are you crying?
Is there something down this alley or something?
i1I bet I couldn't have come to a place like this on my own.
We succubi have established
we succubi give male adventurers dreams that bring them relief.
Please fill in this questionnaire sheet with details of your desired dream.Please write your order for your desired dream on this questionnaire sheet.
Uh, what are these?
There are none.
It's all right. It's a dream, after all.
That's true!
If you sleep too soundly, we can't show you any dreams.
It's crab! Crab!
Without a doubt!
and then unleash my explosion magic after eating it all!
i1You have a will of steel and the strength to endure!
I feel like a billion eris!
an8I do!
Tomorrow. I'll have some tomorrow.
an8Nope. I can't do that.
i1I feel so guilty now.
Good night, everyone.
i1A dream!
i1Maybe the succubus adjusted her to suit my tastes.
N-Now then, that's enough.
wrong...
Huh?
i1Wait, does that mean the Darkness lookalike in the bathroom...
Sir, it is my own bungling incompetence in failing to enter which has led to this state.
S-Sir?
I'll tear you limb from limb!
Go.
actually staying in for the ride.
All I know is that I had a sweet dream.
i1It's the best alibi that I never thought up,
Who could've undone both of those?
All adventurers, equip yourselves and report to the guild!
S-Sure...
Then, if we could hit it with some kind of powerful offensive magic...
I'm sorry I'm late!
I'm the proprietor of Wiz's Magical Tool Shop.
Huh? Huh?
Given my usual behavior, I can see why you would assume that.
But do you really think I'm such a slave to my own desires?
Oh, uh, sure...
Lalatina.
Holy crap. Please tell me we're not completely screwed.
appear now as an intangible distortion!
You did it, Megumin.
i1All hands, evacuate immediately.
Darkness...
Found it!
What?! Come on, he had to have one!
If this shit still don't move, they're gonna kill me. Shit.
Wait. Shit, dude. I'm the guy who made it.
i1I won't be so tactless as to ask, "Suck what out?"
Hey, this isn't good!
and it's still detecting the savory aroma of danger.
The heat from the reactor is escaping?
I'm going to Drain Touch your mana to Wiz so she can cast Explosion!
I can't believe I get to cast Explosion twice in one day
No one's beating me when it comes to quality explosion magic!
i1My party is full of useless freaks. I'm not a fan of it.
i1maybe those were meant to help me grow as a person.
The coronatite that was teleported at your instruction
What? You're not getting a reward?
I need to hack through this boring dull night.
Although we don't have wings,
Judging from your reaction, I'm guessing you forgot again?
That makes me sad.
I'll tell you the story of how you and I met.
Summer's in full swing, all right... Was it this hot last year?
It's not like you have any use for it anyway.
Jeez, you're no fun.
Master, that's total bullshit!
Looks like it's a goner...
so let's try to get along, roomie!
I don't care, just pick the first cheap one you find.
I-I mean it! 'Kay?
Understood. Ene. Will. Forget.
Well, I'll probably never go outside ever again.
Oh dear, I can't see the monitor through all the tears in my eyes!
And to make it worse, I can feel everyone staring at me!
I'll pay for half of it in spirit, so let's get it!
Who the hell was that just now? She was staring daggers at me.
You also don't have a job.
Master?
i1Come on, seriously? What the hell is going on?
I suggest you be more careful from now on.
Well, I'm sure you know what will happen.
Right, Seto?
That hurt! You bastard, whose head do you think you're hitting?!
What are you mumbling about?!
Come on, say something!
Okay, here's your big chance.
Hook me up to a terminal somewhere, and I'll take care of these guys!
Master! Don't give up!
What could he possibly be doing that's taking so long?!
Three days!
All right, let's get this over with!
What's the matter?
Shion!
Let's gather up everything and go kill that monster!
Leave.
but I also involved you two.
If I were gone, you two could be happy in this world.
More precious to me than anything.
I'm sorry.
Marry! If you're there, answer me!
That's just how the tale goes. Who knows if it's true or not?
Who do you think you're talking to, monster?
Mom!
Part B
i1Someone...
you don't have to be afraid!
Would it be okay if I introduced you to my other friends?
Are you sure?
I'm sure they'd be thrilled!
Something spoke to the little girl.
i1So you've finally remembered.
i1It took a long time, though.
i1Nobody knows what the future holds in store.
Stop! Let go of me!
Forget it! I'm not letting go!
That's the same thing!
I-I will...
Well, I don't really want to work with a scary hag like you.
I'm Momo! Get that through your skull!
Eh, what do you mean?
I can't let you die. She'd never want that.
What you're doing is wrong!
I'm only able to exist because of his wish.
I suppose that's true.
The perfect being that rules all the snakes is necessary.
but didn't return from the other world?
How utterly appalling. I'm absolutely speechless.
Now that I can't gather all the snakes together here,
At least give us our dad back!
Idiot.
But you just said that there's no way to bring her back...
Start from scratch.
You...!
You don't want to see your family brutally murdered, do you?
You don't, right?
Kosuke's bringing that girl back with him, remember?
You're the commander of our secret organization.
Oh, come on! We'd just be calling each other by our last names!
Not really.
It's not like you really give a damn about Sis, am I right?
How is it gonna be okay?! Damn it...
You and me are brothers.
Let go of me, I said!
Those guys are the people who tried to nab me and Hiyori earlier!
Is it me, or does it seem like she's been abducted?
ED
an8Let's go back to happier days, shall we?
Endcard
I wish I could express what I'm feeling right now to you, Shion.
Yes...
S-Sorry?
Don't worry.
Hey, Ene
Speaking of which, where the hell is he?
That's 'cause you like stories where the hero comes in at the last minute and saves the day.
It's a wall, all right.
I'm standing right here! Crap!
Ow...
What are you doing?
Part B
He's trying to live up to all of your ideals.
I agree. Mr. Tateyama is more of a slob.
Now, now, don't be in such a rush.
I couldn't believe how smoothly things were going. I could hardly keep from smiling.
Son of a...
Do it!
What's happening... Marry?
I want to be with everyone.
What? Why isn't she going back?
All of my memories...
If you need a wish, I think I have one.
Stop it! That's not what I meant!
Now, now, don't be a crybaby.
Oh, you're alone?
They'll catch up later.
Why do you have to be like that all the time?
No, my bad.
I said it was nothing!
It's nothing.
How long has it been since then?
Don't shake it, you idiot!
You're filming yourself?!
Oh, man. I've missed our verbal sparring.or These conversations feel so nostalgic.
Secret technique, "Swallow Reversal"!
This is so relaxing.
I squeezed 'em together and pushed 'em up!
I know, I know...
I bet the God of Swimming just got all jealous of you.
N-No!
There are some mysteries that science can't explain!
They're about to catch it!
Is that so?
I understand.
Orito?
Check it out! Another Nessie is here!
I-I didn't really...
Eu! Good news.
Haruna would love to be friends with you.
i1For people like us, there are some things that are ultimately unavoidable.
So, what are you planning to give her?
But no matter what you do,
I'm sure she'll love my present the most.
Very well.
I accept your challenge.
i1Would you mind taking Madame Hellscythe somewhere else until our preparations are complete?
TS 16:14 eu Was it really okay for me to have been born?
What happened to Sera?
Haruna, this is no time for kidding around!
The golden rope?
TS 19:33 eu Awakened
Who the hell would do that?!
The Voluptron X!
Orito, you're disgusting.
i1this world is filled with dark secrets that must never be revealed.
She wasn't from this school, was she?
I'm Seraphim, a vampire ninja.
Should you be worrying about something like that?
Give Eu a kiss!
i1Well, whatever they might say...
Tomonori?
Here!
Yuki's working hard trolololreally giving it her all.
Stop it, Kanami.
You first, Hiramatsu.
i1I don't wanna go home till the sun sets.
I see.
Really?
See you later!
Sure. Take care.
What's that smell?
Never mind.
And he's not just your usual mysterious figure.
What kind of depraved creep would cross-dress and carry a chainsaw?!
Miss Fairy!
Haruna!
An explosion?
We can just erase their memories later!
It was me all along.
I got a glimpse under his skirt. He really is wearing panties!
Mystletainn Kick!
Do your thing, Master Mystletainn!
Hurry!
What are you doing, Aikawa!
Are you a perv?
There you were, in the middle of the school in nothing but your birthday suit.
Sometimes, my life's road twists in the most unexpected of directions.
You've become a real celebrity!
Seriously?
Aikawa... Your legs were really pretty...
Oh... I'm sorry...
I would if I could, believe me.
A scandal's just like a candle! A candle! A candle!
That's how it goes.
The guy who keeps muttering nonsense!
You can't beat being out in the wild!
Yeah.
She sells sea
Ugh, I'm so freakin' tired!
Toilet break!
I really appreciate it. Is there anything I can do?
I mean...
Bees?!
Why's it always gotta come to this?
G-Glad to hear it.
The fact that my best friend is a crossdressing pervert,
My love for you will last forever.
Are you retarded?!
This is awesome!
Together, we're Double-Eu!
Right? Right?
Just what do you see in that piece of shit?
and I have been smitten by his ass.
That kind of thing takes time!
q2Eu really wanted the world to know everything about Big Bro!
What are you, a government agency?!I'm guessing this is a joke on bureaucratic red tape
These things take time. Everyone in Virie knows that!Check sp of Virie
Please be patient, okay?
Looks like it's time for the genius Magiclad Girl Haruna to make her move!
Mystletainn was damaged in action!
i1I don't get it.
I can see your inner secrets in all their naked glory!
Tickle tickle tickle!hoore hore hore
So, it looks like the insulation on the Magiclad circuit overloaded.
Did they fix Mystletainn?
I'll have to thank Haruna properly later.
Forgive me!
You're a giant among men. You wouldn't consider one such as myself worthy enough to even step on.hontou wa jibun-gotoki wa ashimoto ni mo oyobanai kyodai na sanmyaku no you na sonzai
What... are you talking about?
Easy does it...ototototo
This brand sure was a nice find.
That's what I lack! Courage!
A voodoo dance?!
And turn!
No... Just this once, I want to stand out on stage like Sarasvati.
Aikawa?
That was amazing, Aikawa!
Keep it up, Yukinori!
It's no good for any of us if Tomonori has to go back to her village.
EuAccusation
I'll make you into the best backup dancer there is!
I trust in you, Master!
Ya doing good?
EuIt's so bad it's good.lit. in fact they're geniuses
Quick, quick! Yeah! And turn!
I'm with you!
Good luck.
Haruna? Tomonori?
Just call for me if you remember anything, okay?
Yeah! Have you been well?
It's been a few weeks since the day that changed everything. where everyone saw me
But even a warrior like me needs time to relax.
Now aren't you having fun?
I see.
Awesome!
Can he escape this Hell?
What did you say?!
What... did you say?
Those creeps look like they're up to something again.
When you see the cute girls in their outfits, you'll lose the will to cross-dress yourself!
Sure. Thanks.
I designed it and made it into a costume caf!
What the hell is with this restaurant?
Is this course really that popular?
You piece of shit voyeur who came to ogle girls in costume.
Free? That'd be good.
Plus we get to spend time with waitresses in costume, which is of course the most important part.
So you just want me to do it for your own sake?
What? Who are they?
What's the matter, Orito?
The genius Haruna couldn't possibly...
i1It's true.
i1What can we do?
Okay!
Go on! Drink!
I prepared that battle uniform just for today.
Be sure to taste her authority to the fullest!
I got it.
Wh-What?!
But I never thought I'd have to see you here too.
Look here.
So will you just give up already?
What a shrewd, calculating fighter!
Aikawa!
Wasn't he useless from the start?
No, please do.
It's pretty late...
I just happened to pass by the shop.
No! Just, no!
Did I get the wrong one?
Haruna, I'll be relying on you while I'm away visiting my village.
You sound just like her big sister.
a terrible omen looms on the horizon...
That tickles!
Eu I hate the white bits on the outside.
Necromancer!
Ok!
I-I know!
i1I have only the purest of intentions!
i1It's not like I want to touch Eu while she's all hot and sweaty!
i1It's not like that at all!
Meditation mode!
i1There should be two guiding lines here.
Sounds like I'd better make you some, then.
i1Maybe we should take her to a doctor.
Just my underwear?!
How is it, Eu?
Blow gently?!
Just let her rest. She'll be all right after a good night's sleep.
Huh? Got hold of what?
You're not gonna get angry?
Here!
at least when she's suffering.
See you!
That reminds me...
Me too.
Don't be so strict, Seraphim.
Sorry! I'm so sorry!
It's not working.
That's right, and there's also that one where you put piles of salt on your head!
What do you mean, "something else"?!
i1You must have been tired.
i1But I was completely focused on Eu.
Ayumu Strip!
Secret technique, "Swallow Pervert Reversal"!
If you're gonna be my servant, you'd better be useful!
I have the key ingredient right here!
The Beginning of the Ending
Cool it, cool it!
One, two,
Hey!
Original Eu!
Blow, blow!
I'll train you guys up!
Um...
That works!
how can we go wrong?
Okay, those in favor of Aikawa's monster caf?
Then, it's decided.
You're coming today as well?
For me, okay?
Sure!
They've got all sorts of tools,
Are you okay?
This guy's trouble...
Where do you think you're looking?
And as for this...
Haruna, could you keep it down a bit?
Jump off a cliff!
It's that feeling of unity where everyone's working toward the same goal.
Well, I should head off.
Well... Um, sorry...
Yep.
Oh, over here...
A fulfilling school life!lol barairo. epiccrapfestround2starto
Rejoice, Ayumoron!
Everyone!
Come on, hurry up!
It looks good, Ayumu.
Just a sec!
We haven't sold a single copy!
I... need to talk to you.
But there's nobody here.
Th-Thanks for coming here with me, though.
If y-you s-suddenly
Who's there?!
You're that guy from before!
Uh... Where should I start explaining from?
No!
I guess that's how it goes!
That's why they call me the Genius Baroness of Darkness, Magiclad Girl Haruna!
It's been a while since one's appeared here.
No.
Haruna?!
which manipulates cause and effect for all of creation.
The clothes of an impostor, chosen by Gaia...
HarunaThey had all the tools and material I needed!
An expert on magic?
It's about time.
Take care.
Let's keep it rolling and give it everything we've got!
Aikawa!
You looked cute in it.
That is to say, it has a special purpose...
But if you think of anything dirty
We'll go looking around the stalls.
Thank you for waiting!
What'll it be?
And one chocolate  banana crepe, please.
I understand.
But...
Excellent! Marvelous! Great!
Answer me!
C'mon, don't look at me like that.
I'm happy with my life now, so I guess you're no longer...
I won't let self-doubt hold me back again.
How could this happen?
Somehow, I can speak again!
But I threw that away before!
I used this to absorb the mana from those girls.
And then,
That was also me!
I wanna buy a pet dog...
But, but, underneath that exterior was your very own favorite li'l Miss Fairy herself!
Still judging people by what's on the outside, huh?
Yeah, that!
I'd wake up every morning with my legs feeling cramped
No way.
What's the meaning of this?!
Oh, I forgot to say! Strong feelings of arousal also cause the chairs to launch.
Let's end this.
Then I'll go back to being a boring ol' dude!
that you'd have been a great drinking buddy.
I'll always be waiting for you to come back to me, okay?
This is troubling.
Instructor Ariel.
The Beginning of the Ending
Isn't it against the rules for the real Eu to appear in Ayumu's fantasies?
We're so annoyed that we're gonna talk a whole lot right now!
Our raison d'tre!
The strongest Magiclad Girl, Chris.
The day that Aikawa Ayumu was slain by the Magiclad Girl known as Kyouko.
You must have traveled far.
A so-called genius, bereft of her magic...
Huh? There's still so much I want to do.
Even though you're a zombie?
Yeah, but everything after that is just a blur...
It means, "Let's have fun!"
Right! I'll leave it to you, then!
Aikawa's all dried out from the stress!
If it's free, whatever.
Be excellent to each other! Oh yeah!
A ninja considers herself superior to no one.
Your so-called mission is just a cover of your own!
An excuse for you to stay attached to Aikawa Ayumu!
People yearn for each other's warmth.
I'm your host, Aikawa Ayumu!
Excuse me...
q2Eu, you're the only one who understands what I'm going through.
Okay, let's start.
If you react like that, it just makes me even more nervous.
Let's have some fun!
i1fo Regnibrah a tub...
My prison sentence will last hundreds of years.
Will you still remember me even then?
No, that's an abuse of authority!
It's just sad.
Let's play! Let's play!
To regain Haruna's stolen powers,
I see you're here again, Eucliwood.
Just as I promised you, right?
I must fulfill my oath...
You hadn't picked up on that, Ayumu?
Don't sweat the small stuff, okay?
Aikawa. Are you prepared?
Right... Gotta keep the casualties to a minimum...
That's the first time I've seen Anderson like that...
What? If you drink it like this, it'll be a indirect kiss...
If you're free?
Th-These soft, warm, plump things are...
Hello?
This is the girl who floats like a butterfly and thinks like a bee! What's up?
Genius?
Have you kept it safe?
eu Excuse us.
so I'll come right out with it.
Eu Long time no see.
He's a man, after all.
You lecherous piece of shit.
Eu Could this be...
That's right.
Why the "Devil" part?!
She left the fort building to me, right?
Oh, crap!
What're you doing, Ayumoron?
S'okay, don't stress 'bout it!
Let's launch headfirst into the final!
You said it, didn't you?
So... Do you think you could stop calling me that?
Another bowl of fried tofu, comin' right up!
Plat plat!
More! More!
Thank you!
Chris is far too dangerous for you.
You gotta pass the test!
A harem's forming around me as we speak!
My class is a hands-on experience!
Mix it all 'round and scramble it real good!
That's a perverted slime all right!
Ms. Haruna!
is a gentleman!
Let's see what you're made of.
I'm a zombie!
Where do you think you're touching?!
So it came to this, huh?
There's no longer anything we can do.
You don't have to go.
I'm having second thoughts.
Me too.
Head Instructor!
Ayumoron!
I guess my main body is causing you trouble.
A small piece of Ayumu's lost memory.
until you can pass a test like this with your eyes shut.
What sort of person was I?
Goal!
Well done making it this far,
How pretentious.
Satanapparently the whole gang is here.
I'm here to get Ayumu's memories back!
Htaed!
What?!
Fo!
They sucked!
Who cares?
From the start, all I wanted was a quiet life.
You don't need to worry about me.
He's not the kind of person who could just accept that and leave you alone.
Isn't that a good thing?
Okay...
In other words, another possible Ayumu.
I see.
Yeah.
Is this how you repay my kindness?!
Please, stop that. Don't you know about my feelings for you?
How sorrowful.
You're surprised? It's just like him.
Eu So don't ever do it again.
Shut up! You're Ayumoron!
First you, and now Ariel's looking after Aikawa too?
Well, it's good that everything's back to normal,
Thank you.
Off to another hard day at school?
If I can catch the bus, I might just make it!
I-I just...
No way! But I studied so hard...
W-Well, um...
Stuff like "1820-1872" was written next to the other people,
I just figured I had to put in some sort of cool-sounding victory catch phrase.
Your answers make it seem like you want to see historical figures duke it out in a fighting tournament.
Where's this coming from? You're freaking me out.
Damn it! I tried my best, but I was still late again!
i1One more thing. Don't go out in public, okay?
i1Your single was a huge hit, so you'd get flooded by fans and cause a huge commotion.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
Well aren't you a little cutie!
Calling it a day, Prez?
They're all style and no substance!
I-I... Um.
It was my... It was my final contest...
You don't have to worry about me.
You're such a worrywart, Momo.
I want to become an idol.
Part B
O-Oh! I'm sorry!
Yeah. I was asked to pick up a few things.
But I've never been in this part of town before, so I'm kind of...
I can spot people like you a mile away!
I just want to be normal...
The endlessly sprawling sky.
TS 00:35 Delicious
You're gonna get sick.
'Sup y'all!
Flea market?
So, Haruna!
Ayumu.
All right.
This is strange. They are not selling at all.
Hey, Aikawa!
Sure!
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's exactly what's so fascinating about her! JoJo reference. wt 
Bring out your best item!
Come on! Bring out Sera's...
Haruna!
It's too early to give up.
We brought customers.
Teacher!
Us too!
How much, Haruna?!
Huh? It's gone. Where did it go?
Hey, don't you think you're being a little harsh here?!
What do you mean, "probably"?!
We could use your condition to our advantage.
You're doing it wrong. You need to hold for a bit!
Well, I felt kinda... weird just now.
i1What?i0
H-Hiramatsu.
I-I put them in the laundry... I feel this expression is so wrong. "putting them in the process of laundry" sounds all too awkward too though.
Oh, sorry.
Hiramatsu, is this...
You saved me!
Thanks to Saras' directions, I was able to locate it in the house.
Let's eat!
but this world is filled with many dark secrets, which must never see the light of day.
However, fate chooses those who will be thrown into the fray to learn these secrets,
That's it for class today.
What's an elementary schooler like you doing here?
Stop that.
Stop that!
You disgust me.
A ghost?
I'm Seraphim, a Vampire-Ninja. What about it?
Magic totally works the same way as science, correct?
Right?
Well, they act more like a married couple, so it's kind of refreshing.
Premium farm-fresh eggs!
I'm pioneering the field of eggnology!
Finally, I can go home.
Why are you using this alcohol lamp to cook the squid?
If you drink that much...
Tee hee 3... I shouldn't give under-age kids drinks like this!
Uh, thanks.
You're a hero after all!
Carefree friend?
Bayumu...!
Yeah.
Doesn't this look like Aikawa?
There's no way a pitiful thing like that exists!
yet there's no girl here.

Disappear!
Pervert!
Don't look!
Pissed
He is supposed to fight in my stead!
Make sure you never come back here again.
Sera?
What in the world has happened here?!
Orito!
I hate being the centre of attention.
No, I'm under-age.
Sure!
Nomobuyo!
Nomobuyo! Nomobuyo!
Watching the stars?
Not really... but I guess it's fine.
I see.
I-I told you it's not like that!
 It's dangerous to be alone.
S-Say, Aikawa.
I mean, uh...
Sure...
Haruna?
I can't see where I'm going!
What are you doing?
You're just jealous.Don't be jealous! Don't be jealous!
Yes.
That's unthinkable.
I'm an idiot.
However, the ever-changing stars are also beautiful.
I-It's beautiful, isn't it?
Let's all come back here next year, Ayumu.
Yes?
You fool!
What the hell is this?
I'm in a lot of trouble right now, you know!
Huh? Aikawa-san?
What's the matter?
Why don't you just give it up?
What?
Why don't we remove that cute cover of yours first? covercase
signIf you resist, you will get hurt.
Don't worry, it'll only hurt at first.
Here? Or is it over here?
I'm home!
I'll eat later.
Oh, I see, I see!
Sera?
Emashiteresuwa Moka Monina Momeyu Moia!
What are you talking about, Orito?
Orito is currently trying to face reality.
What?
Orito is fighting within himself to accept the new Ayumu.GAY!
he's trying to be reborn.
I'll say it again!
I'm sure there are days like that.
And because the glass is so small, you couldn't refuse!reject!
Wouldn't this be violence from friendliness?
Geez! Just when I thought it was completely fixed.
It hurts! Stop it, Yukinori!
There's no doubt about it.
Then give up.
Vampire-ninjas are supposed to live in the shadows.
All right! I got it!
Guess it can't be helped!
More! Move some more, Yukinori!
Aikawa!
I heard your conversation.
If you can't do that, I'll have you leave the village!
Break there!
I can't breathe...
Stop it!
The one who used you, the King of the Night.
The three of us are Imaginary Eu A, B, C!
Right? Is everyone doing fine?
I see!
The sadness of the battle.
There's no doubt that they're planning on doing something perverted. things.
Don't make a fool out of me.
I'm not going for those today.
You sure have guts to come back herein front of me, you damn weakling.
Also, why do you get so close to my face when you talk to me?do you always come close to my face when you're talking to me?
Sera, what are you doing?!
S-Sera-san, you've got a nice body, you know?
You need drinks?
If I get enough votes, they'll give me a raise.
So what do you want to order?
I don't really get it, but she said I have to say it.
Huh? Who are they?!
Well then, let the hell banquet begin! tlc
I-I'm still learning.
I see.
Seducing her with kind words.
This restaurant has some great talent.
Just what should I do?
In the meantime, I'll have more water.
A woman's heart is quite deep.
It's fine.
She's good. No one will survive eating that.She's good. No one can survive after eating that.
You didn't have to eat it if you didn't want tocouldn't, okay?
Really?
Come, Saras!
Would you be okay if you gave up cross-dressing?Is it okay for you to give up cross-dressing?
I love you, Mihara!
I was just caught off guard. That's all!
I will never wash this hand of mine!
How did you know Eu's name?
Wrong!
Plastic models!
Here, Scroll of the Earth!
Well then, while I'm back at my village,
I got it!
It's like you're her big sister now.
as too many mysterious incidents occur in that city.
You really peel those off meticulously.
Thank you, Eu.
The pith of a mandarin tastes quite bitter, after all.
signNothing. I'm fine.
Hey, be careful.
I'm freeing myself from my earthly desires!
It's like you're her big sister now.
Hold on. Resident of the Underworld?
Without having a single doubt?
All right.
Take a deep breath, Aikawa!
Here, can you eat it?
You have to sleep!
Oh, then I got this too.
S-Sure...
I-It's not like I...
I'll just have to pass that to Eu, correct?
What do you think I am?
I'm fine now.
Her sickness must be something more serious.
These symptoms are...
Is something wrong?!
Aikawa, have you been feeding mandarin skins to Eucliwood?
Sarasvati.
No, don't take your eyes off Ayumu.fix me timing!
My skin feels so smooth!
Backstroke?
Who would've thought that you'd actually get better.
Isn't it great that she recovered?
Isn't your face getting a bit red, Haruna?
But I was completely focused on Eu.
I'm sure she doesn't want anybody else to worry about her.
Let me go!
There's a limit to how perverted you can be!
Desiccated Old Man.
One, two.
It doesn't seem like it's cooling down.
What do you expect me to say?
Haruna-sensei!
I'll use real spices this time.
Tomonori brought her to cooking class the other daylast time, and then...
I think it will work!
You're coming today as well?
If I'm not there, nothing will get done.Nothing will get started if I'm not there.
Sign, Eu Notebook, timecodeHaruna is having fun.
Haruna's enthusiasm passed onto me.
My doctor told me not to greet others cheerfully.
T-Take this.
Does Dracula's cape look like this?
Um, Aikawa-kun.
W-What are you doing?!
I am! It's a bra top!
I said it.
Okay!
Do you think we could put this here?
Yes.
It looks pretty good, doesn't it?It looks like it's done pretty well, doesn't it?

A-Aikawa?
Nee-san, that's dangerous.
There's no choice.
A-Aikawa...
My feelings for you won't change, even if someone else confesses to me.
With the two of us here alone,

Did you go to Ayumu's school to build that magic absorption device?
A kind person.
It's almost time.
Y-Yeah.
You're not wearing your swimsuit today?
T-That was just for yesterday!
Don't make me say something so embarrassing!
Isn't that obvious?
I...
However, if you think about anything naughty,
Moho?!
Aikawa-senpai, do you want to walk around the cultural festival with me?
I smell a lot on this thing!
This guy's worth a fortune!
Thanks for waiting.
An individual hides within a crowd!
Have you forgotten what you learned back in the village?!
Aikawa, I'm free right now, so let's go and look around together.
Fairy-san.
I will continue to live without doubting myself.
What?!
Aikawa-kun, you're so dirty!
N-No, you're mistaken!
Your magic?
Her name is Chris.
What a terrible curse!
a genius capable of inventing a machine to absorb and store that power,
With these, I can talk and experience emotions without any trouble.
Nakatenna nichito ha hakesaoba. i'm fucking drunk to know what she's sayinguhh...
Oh! What's happened?
my gamma-GTP and cholesterol levels were very bad.
and when I look in the mirror, I see the same useless old man's face looking back.
so why do I have to suffer like this?
No way!
I'm aroused!
Stupid Bayumu, don't ever underestimate me!
I can still fight Megalos!
Four hundred.
Is that true, Bayumu?!
One demand!
Not fair! You're stealing our raison d'tre!
My, what delicious tea.
I've been extremely bored.
Leave this to me.
Three hundred percent!
Let's take this outside!
Just when I warned him, and now this shameful sight...
You're organising one?
Aikawa-san is in trouble!
Want me to help?
I'll leave it to you then.
Aikawa shrivelled up from the stress!
E-Everyone's my friend! Oh yeah!
It's best when you get even more shrivelled up.
Oh? It's true I wanted to go to a co-ed party.
Saras!
Good grief. That butt of his...
All right!
So... what is a co-ed party?
It's a blind group date.
Man...
It's totally see-through!
Cute...
I'm the one who got Aikawa-senpai to invite you to this party.
It's all right, boy.
The staff members are so nice!
You're the only one who understands me, Eu.
It's my first time being in a place like this. I'm really nervous!
signThe King's orders are absolute!
She's mega serious.
Aikawa-san, you shouldn't make a girl feel embarrassed, okay?
Okay then, number three and number seven...
Who's number seven?!
A game! It's just a game, okay?!
Dai-sensei!
Argh! You're older, huh?!
I will not hold back.
I'm not good at hosting things like co-ed parties.
That might be so.
There's no turning back now.
You're one stupid guy.
But their memories of me...
Hello?
S-class?!
No one could defeat her regardless of how many times they fought!
Before the army of Virie invaded the Underworld,
when I had not yet abandoned my voice and emotions...
Even my words could not slightly describe it!
Right?
I'll defend this world.
You didn't know, Ayumu?
I'm the girl who lives in the present!
Right. We got to keep the casualties to a minimum...
Maybe she's not home.
She fell asleep!
That's impossible!
That's because it'll be between Virie's strongest and the Underworld's strongest, right?
Hello?
There's something I need help with, from a genius like you.
Did you get some food?
It's about my concert.
Yeah, I'll definitely be there.
signShe's bawling.
Huh? When did things get so lively?
Oh!
Haruna-chan, was it?
That's right.
and Eucliwood hadn't lost her voice,
sign Why did you draw this story?
Simmer away...
You thoughtless murderer!
You sure made a mess out of it!
I can handle the rest by myself.
I may not be able to win against Chris,
Those who want to die, come forth!
You said it, didn't you?
You kept your promise to me.
I'm really sorry.
Nope.
Everyone sure is taking an interest in him.
Those who are showing hideous fangs...
That this is nothing like love
I hope you'll feel it with this song
Pleased to meet you all.
Just what are you planning?!
A test?
Mix it round and round and scramble it good!
So that's okay...
Be sure it's at mach speed!
There's only a paper-thin difference between the recipes for fried eggs and slime.
That's the first time I've heard that!
Haruna-sensei!
W-What should I do?!
This guy...
Taeko!
Taeko, get ahold of yourself!
You idiot! You're pulling me down!
Goodness.
Why are you weird people in my house?
Shall we go home?
Magic... is really an incredible thing.
What are you?
What is this embarrassing stage?
How disgusting.
Lucifer.i don't have to repeat now, do i?
Um... Was I really like this?
This is getting annoying.
Who cares?
I wonder.
Even the most powerful magic cannot reveal the innermost truths of the heart.
Sure?
Another Ayumu-san?
In other words, another possibility.
Oh?
Haruna-san and the others seem to have failed, haven't they?
Well, I'm off to school.
sign That's not good.
This world is filled with many dark secrets which must never see the light of day.
Aikawa-san, could you stop by the staff room later on?
God dammit!
Eu?
Please, stop that.
Let's take this outside!
Really?
Please come back...
Eu.
You truly are as hopeless as you are disgusting.
signNo matter how you look at it, you are suspiciously stupid.
Sera?
Thank you.
What do you want this early on a Sunday, Orito?
Okay, put these up for sale.
Working with Onii-chan at the flea market is so much fun!
Why did you suddenly challenge Haruna to a flea market battle?
Sera-san!
It makes my ears bleed.
I'll do my best!
I'm not in such a pathetic state as to ask Bayumu for help.
There's nothing worthwhile here.
Is that so?
Come one, come all!
Oh, how cute.
How much are these?
300 yen.
Thanks.
Tae-chan made all of these sweets by hand.
Woah, they look delicious!
It's true!
Of course I will, Kirara-tan.
if you ever cut in line again,
This is exactly why I look up to her!
I have everything you could want for surprisingly low prices!
Why are there so many customers at his shop?
It's too early to give up, Haruna-chan!
Huh? It's not here. Where is it?
Yu's notebook Haruna was planning on selling it.
If I sold it, I could've made around 500 million yen. Which is why...
What do you mean by that?!
Of course I don't!
At first sight, it might be seen as "just a pendant".
You're probably right.
It's complicated...
I felt something...
Come on!
Next up is a face-down upper body stretch.
I can't hold any longer.
This hip...
Yes, I'm looking for something.
This is definitely a crime!
I was looking for something...
That's the biggest insult I've received!
But there's no helping it.
Are you looking for something to cover yourself with, by any chance?
I don't mind.
Woah!
Idiot! Don't touch it!
signIt's fine.
Take that! Tae-chan!
Have your breasts always been that big? lit: Do you really have such breasts?
Ah, I see.
How can you sink even with a kickboard?
I'm sure the god of swimming is just jealous of you.
Legend has it that Nessie is here in the pool.
Eu?
I've got hold of the target!
Eh, Haruna?!
No, it couldn't be. That Haruna...
Hiramatsu's skin...
I mustn't look.
I mustn't look!
I mustn't look!!
No, I have to go to where Eu is.
Damn bug, swarming around watermelon rinds and kicked by donkeys.
Shut up and behave yourself!
What are you doing, Ayumu?
Sera put me in this.
The reason why she invited us to find Nessie was because she wanted to play with Eu.
Eu?
Honestly, you slow sand treader... you're inferior even to maggots.
Anyway, no matter what you give her,
Yes. But it wouldn't be much of a fight.
Hey! Don't make me answer on reflex!
C'mon, let's go in.
It's a 100 mineral-based, gorgeous mushroom hamburger.
Correct!

But it only decreases from that point on...
What's shabu-shabu?
Now then, let's eat the cake.
Bad luck is inescapable for people.
Sometimes we might even want to die.
with rain in some areas.
Well then, have a good day!
Things like the weather report can't be trusted.
Let me see your notes.
This is what they call "tsun," right?
Onii-chan, I'm hungry.
No, if you hadn't brought me back to life,
I'm thankful for that.
She's been here for a month so far.
Probably because I'm a zombie.
It's a long story.I have my reasons.
Gross!
Wait, what the...
Right now!
Immediately! Now! Now, now, now, now!
I didn't know I had such hidden powers.

Necromancer of the underworld, Eucliwood Hellscythe-san.
Oh yeah, hey you.
Don't treat me like an idiot!
"Hello? Hello?"
I see. It's just like a phone.
Masou-Shoujo presence detected.
Still not going home?
You've been staying back recently. What have you been doing?
were living happily with two beautiful girls,
I'd be ruined.
Seems like you've got something big going on.
See ya!
but I didn't think a worse fate would await me.
Human, why is there magic inside you?
I'm the genius Masou-Shoujo!
...am a zombie!
Huh? Why?
Since you stole my magic powers, Please double check this line and the next one. -sm
All right, follow my lead. All right? Follow me!
Only the clothes?!
That's not a kick!
Hey!
...ruined!Please double check the ellipsis here. -sm
I thought so too!
How about changing the way you are called?
Using my magical powers,
I-It's not like I made it for you or anything...I-It's nothing, I didn't make it for you...
She's fast!
Meat too.
Truffles.
Haruna seems to be quite harmless.
Hey, you.
It's all about the Swallow Reversal Technique, huh?
Manservant.
You really do as you please, don't you?
However, you are not a human with life.
...is the Swallow Reversal Technique!
She's strong!
The Swallow Reversal Technique...
It's over!
I'm...
I want to know too.
So, let me be by your side, Hellscythe-dono.
...or something.
She seems to have her own reasons for being like that.
The way she is now,
My heart is gradually-
What's that?
After I met Eu, I understood how fun it was.
See you!
Awesome.
But...
My body...
I'm... alive?
Give me another heaping bowl!
I guess it's fine.
Don't laugh! It's gross.
W-What?
Shut up! Don't pet my head, stupid Ayumu!
W-What are you doing?!
Genius Masou-Shoujo, Haruna-chan!
It feels like today is going to be another bad day.
Also, I'm a Masou-Shoujo.
If you want it that badly, why not just go buy some more?
It's impossible to remove any more blocks.
Ron!
Counter Revolution!
My chest feels like it's about to burst.
All right! How's that?
That girl has an amazing figure.
She must be some magazine model.
I see! She cosplays for her photoshoots!
It's seorita.
You damn perverted harem bastard!
I said look over here!
Masked Ayumu!
I am...
To be honest, it happened so suddenly, and with all the commotion...
How many heart-throbbing moments have there been?
It's a duel! Aikawa!
I don't understand.
It's a girl.
Why did I have to come with you?
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.
Isn't she cute?
What are you being so polite for?
Really?
With that description,
Yes.
Ah, this?
That person, the culprit,
It can't be. Could the culprit be...
More!
Gimme a hand!
Hungry.
Eh... Do you like that?
A Megalo?
Aikawa-san, you came to the underworld once,
I forgot.
There are people who were killed nearby,
I was really surprised back there.
Eh?
I would never have thought that Hellscythe-sama would use her powers on you.
An extraordinary being. The core of everything.
it means she recognises you as someone special.
Then, where did they go?
Sacrifice. It means to be killed for tribute to something.
And if that interferes with the threads of fate, it will change reality.
The reason I don't say words is because they would be filled with magic.
A powerful force flows through my veins,
But this is a bit beyond what I'd imagined.
That's a...
you damn insect.
For my sake! And only my sake!
It's a bit reckless, but let's give it a try.
Don't worry. Just leave everything to me.
Anaesthetic?
I'll pass.
You perverted, erotic bastard!
Fine, fine.
Stop it, I said!
Do you need to talk to Haruna?
In that case, I can take care of that somehow.
I definitely told her to go to Kyoto.
So basically, she was supposed to go to Kyoto to buy Kyotofu, but came to Tokyo by accident?
How puzzling.
Yes, I agree.
Ah, but recently, something unexpected happened.
She remembered just one person's name.
It's from Dai-sensei.
I wanted to hear your voice, too.
All I can do is hide and take cover.
I'm amazed Kyouko-chan didn't mind coming to a place like this.
I'll do my best to come back as soon as possible.
Want to come along?
May I volunteer for the position?
...life.
Kyouko... -chan?
I'm Orito-san's childhood friend.
They were all lies.
I... can't move...
Ayumu's enemy? Then she's my enemy too.
I'm a genius after all.
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal!
Now, time for me to be serious. Please die!
I told you this was two versus one, didn't I?
You're a zombie?!
Hellscythe-dono...
The ultimate Masou-Shoujo...
Hey, did you know?
400!
Why don't you just lose already?!
Who would...?
That's why Eu sealed her powers.
 Die
All my magic... release!
I've never felt like this before.
I have this burning feeling in my chest.
I see.
Ayumu, I came up with a new move.
After we get home, will you help me think of a name for it?
Skill Name Not Decided!
Ah, that felt good.
I won't let you kill anyone anymore!
Die! Die! Die!
How annoying!
Are you stupid?
That's right. Stupidity is something that can't be cured without dying.
Huh?
Being alone was peaceful,
but I could never know what happiness was.
Then resurrect and show me!
Let go!
No...
Everyone thought the same.
Well, it's not like I don't understand your anger, but...
I'll have to re-educate her.
I don't plan on doing anything yet.
Um, Dai-sensei.
Y-Yes!
Eu, that guy just now...
Well, anyway, let's move on for now.
I'm here for you.
Although I don't really understand, but...
I thought you were making pudding.
TL Note: Yoshida Yuki, which can also be read as Yoshida Tomonori in Japanese.
Thanks for the meal.
Root three minus root two.
Where are the process equations?
Right?
The path of mathematics is long, unyielding and far.
Be sure to catch them all.
Her cooking is delicious too.
Thank you.
If you're fine with me, I'll do anything.
Anyway, I'll have it sent over to you, for sure.
Hot... Ho... H... Ho...
Hot! Ho... Ho... Hot...
Oh, yes!
Ayumu!
Looks delicious!
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?
The Megalo are disappearing from just having Tonkotsu Ramen splashed on them?
Long time no see! How have you beenfscx300-
You were seriously trying to break my arm, weren't you?
Is it broken or anything? Let me see.
E-Excuse me for my insolence.
Delicious!
And this barbecue pork!
and analysed the soup's flavour.
Isn't it amazing?
Yes, if that was used, it'd be problematic on an ecological level.
I see, that's fine then.
For Vampire-Ninjas, a kiss symbolises marriage regardless of where and when it happens.
That's why you should have avoided it, no matter what.
What did everyone write?
Ayumu, that suits you quite well.
It's a secret!
It's now officially your responsibility.
Don't call me that!
They're erotic glasses?!
Shall I turn you into a friend of a friend, too?
Cuter than Eu, cuter than Sera, cuter than anyone in the world.
Miracle.
Do I have to take responsibility for other people's dreams?
If dark seaweed looks like fried eggs to you, that's probably it.
What is?
I feel lazy
That's because it's Aikawa! He's friends with that Orito!
What kind of circumstances are you talking about?
W-Well, yeah... a school wife.
No, I'll do it! The bigger the hurdle, the more fired up I am!
Bento again?
Wait!
Are you okay with going home this way?
I see.
Ah, that?
I'm going this way.
Haruna?!
Well, sorry about that.
I'll take you out to play in the coming holidays, so cheer up.
To play?!
Ah well, I'm glad there's a roof.
Don't say stuff like that outside school!
Kids nowadays are so daring.
My eyes! My eyes!
Onii-chan! Eu's tummy is growling!
Want me to carry them?
O-Okay.
I want that!
What do you want to drink?
Do I have to lose against her?!
Sorry for keeping you guys waiting!
Ah! I'll turn you into a bride, too!
What?
How did that turn into having to kill Eu?!
That's impossible.
What do you want?
I was astonished you were in a place like that and even had made friends.
That's right...
Don't say that like it's so simple!
Y-Yeah!
But thanks to you, I've broken free.
If you continue refusing to listen to what I want...
Ayumu!
Huh?
Is that a Megalo?
Haruna!
Oh? You know about me?
If I pull this out, it'll dissolve.
No, that's nothing special.
Mystletainn?
Eh? Why?
Yes, the breath of the gods shall beckon a blizzard.
Break through... Absolute Venril.
It will eventually shut off on its own.
We have no choice but to have Ayumu-san do something about it.
We don't have a choice.
Why... Why are you crying?
H... Hold on, Tomonori!
You think I'll... let you do that?!
6...
Smells burnt...
Take care on your way back.
Aikawa, th-thank you for today.
Later, then!
I'm terribly sorry for putting you through so much.
"Just give up already", and I would have meekly obeyed.
Not at all.
...because I abandoned my mission.
What's that...?
You're quicker than I thought.
Would you like to die so you can see her again?
Wait!
At least use the type for clothing.
I see.
You're heavy!
Wow, it's really in the neighbourhood!
You do it like this.
You came back, huh?
Now, come with me.
You shouldn't be getting up!
You came here?
Eu!
I think so.
How about you?
Don't be in such a rush.
It's delicious, you know...
I refuse.
Eu!
Eu...
No! No!
I can't do it like this.
Stop!
All right. This one!
...how truly disgusting he is.
Why won't he get up?
It may be...
Haruna...
You only get to sleep once you've actually done something.
Disappear! Disappear!
You'll be needing that, won't you?
I know. It's his doing.
because of the detestable resistance you're putting up.
You know, when I achieved immortality,
I don't want to kill my friends anymore.
We zombies can't die from wounds like these.
These are the results of what will happen with your good intentions.
There's no choice then.
Is there anything we can do about it?
Double Mystletainn Kick!
Then I'll use 500!
Eu's smile... her cutest expression...
Have you never seen it?!
It's been long enough, right, Eucliwood?
I'll never let go!
That's right, I'm selfish!
 I understand.
Yeah, it's selfish.
Welcome back, Eu.
What the...?
That's disgusting.
Even though I'm a zombie.
So we can expect some accidental exposures?
Ah, Eu...
In a way, yes...
Yeah.
Well, I won't stop you.
I can't believe...
Living.
But while in the light, I am... Lovely Kirara!
Or is this very moment her dbut? An introduction event?
What an amazing performance!
I don't understand at all.
Will she ever be able to return to being a normal girl?
Stop this at once!
If that's how you feel, try and stop me.
I won't be convinced by your words alone.
Why did things turn out this way...?
I'm going to lose.
What a gruesome battlefield...
My dreams may have just come true.
I don't care. Just listen to my song!
It's stuck!
That girl might be a diamond.
That's wrong!
You idiot!
Rock out!
What are you doing here?
I'm so thankful. I'm so thankful.
Since there's no other choice.
It would be great if all the women in the world could wear such wonderful outfits.
Is it okay for you to say that?
Mystletainn-sensei?
This isn't right!
Festifall, Festifall!
This would surely result in a fierce battle.
Even though it's Seraphim's hand-made dressing...
Don't worry about me... Just go.
Eroticism!erosa
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal.
The ero-soul is the most suitable eternal theme for life.
Come.
I actually...
This Kokeshidama will give us ero-power!
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal!
What's that?
Apparently a recipe that's been passed down in the Vampire-Ninja's village.
It'll be fine if I tell her to bring it back immediately, right?It'd be okay if I get her to bring it right back, right?
So I'm going to Virie tomorrow to show it off to Dai-sensei!
See you!
I'm the one going?
Onii-chan, you can do it!
Grossness at its maximum.
Pervert. Pervert. Pervert.

Can we really make meat stew like this?
In other words, miso.
Wait!
I mean, you were smiling just now.
And now, let the first round of the preliminaries begin!
Great job, Orito!

If you go out, please take an umbrella with you.

But, to be honest, that's a lie.
Eu, I'm home.
Onii-chan, I'm hungry.
I'm thankful for that.
Y-Yeah.
It's no use searching randomly.
A cosplayer?
Mystletainn magic power, full throttle!
The thing I just killed was a B-class Megalo Kumocchi.
I don't believe anyone who refers to herself as a genius.
Get me a futon as well.
Let's play it at your house.
You can't!

Living by himself must be difficult.
Should I just think of her as a noisy stray cat staying with me?
Super Masou Transformation.
I'll go for the other magical presence!
Don't say such a stupid thing!
Only the clothes?!
What was my special technique again?
Is that you, Aikawa?
Thank goodness.
I'm... already...
To be honest, I'm actually not a zombie.
That night, I... was murdered.
Then I met this illusionary girl.Then I met this fantasy-like girl.
That's all there is to it.
What is with this delicious flavour?!
Trade me for this bread, OK?
It's ready!
Meat too.
Well, whatever the reason,
Onii-chan's rice is the best.
You're not a friend of Haruna's?
My name is Seraphim.
I require her assistance.
So, you're a ninja?
Why are you still here?
You plan on staying here?!
For example, you must wear a maid uniform and be nice every morning.
You've only just met her, so what do you know?
Damn insect, do something about it please.
That night, a month ago.
Your eyes totally trapped me!
Shit, I screwed up.
What the hell happened...
Ayumu, seconds!
Give me another heaping bowl!
I don't think anything would happen over one or two days.
Don't laugh! It's gross.
You're a ninja, yet your name is Seraphim.
After all, I'm a vampire.
Shut up.
Should I turn you into a vampire ninja?
Genius Masou-Shoujo, Haruna-chan!
It feels like today is going to be another bad day.
So this is two on one?
So you're not giving me all of it.
Speaking of that damn bug,
I'm busy working two shifts.
There were two tickets. Could this be fate?
Everything I hear makes him sound like a strange little pervert.i'm using hentai here because it can mean either abnormal or perverteveryone will hear "hentai" and expect "pervert".-AvidElite

Ayumu, why do you have that thing over your face?
It's gross.
It happened so suddenly, and with all the commotion...
It's fine. It's fine already.
So...
I'm jealous!
Aikawa!
It's a duel! Aikawa!
A formidable opponent.but the furigana reads "Tomo" which means friend
No, this is...
Actually I...
I see.
but did you see the face of your attacker?
did she happen to have an odd gauntlet here and silky silver straight hair?
A-Ahh.
...but I can't say that.
I'm glad. You don't seem to have a fever.
it seemed like she felt nothing about killing people.
Your posture is quite nice as well.
The pudding is mine!
Loli busty young frail characters are so awesome!
It's going to vanish this year, Onii-chan.
It's a mystery to me, too.
This is the first time I've tried this thing called "cooking."
It's quite interesting, isn't it?
Who is she talking to?
I haven't found the artifact yet.
Take care!
What is this "artifact"?
Terror?
Yes, yes! I'm coming!
A Doberman?!
So you were the one responsible.
Bear with it?
Basically, she would feel the same pain as you when you are wounded.
We're too late.
I wonder; I don't know the details.
All I know is a name.
Aikawa-san...
You mustn't... make her sad...
Eu, tell me.
EuWhen my words transform into power, I feel extreme pain in my head. I don't want that to happen anymore.
Eu Yes. Even if I die, the magic powers will still activate.
Don't say that! I don't see a monster anywhere!
Eu Is it all right for me to stay with you?
If that's the price I have to pay to be with Eu, that's nothing!
Don't make it sound so simple!
Go Ayumu!
Ayumu.
The head, you say...
Now's your chance!
Can you make your sword bigger?
950... 980...
What the hell is this?!
All right!added -Kanade
Don't worry. Just leave everything to me.
I'll rip off your legs, shove them down your throat, then set you on fire.
H-Hey, if you like, next time, you could suck my blood-
EuNo problem.
Do you need to talk to Haruna?
She's kind of unavailable right now.
Kyotofu?
Yes, it's an errand I asked Haruna to do.
In that case, I can take care of that somehow.
Ah, but if you can call my cellphone, then why not just order Kyotofu directly?
Hey!
...was what you said, but in the end, you're still tagging along.
May I volunteer for the position?
I went through all the trouble of collecting powerful souls and even had to kill a Megalo monster. How gross.
You're more worried about the tofu than me?
Hey, say something Ayumu!
Oh, a magical barrier, huh?
I see. That's why memory manipulation didn't work on Aikawa-san.
Sera, is she...?
I can't do this. Why?
We don't have time for you to hesitate! You insect chara-
I'll have to refuse both.
I guess it's over.
Amazing! Amazing!
Magic powers are to be consumed by even greater magic powers.

Ayumu, if you call yourself a servant of Hellscythe-dono, then...
Yeah.
Huh?
D-Dai-sensei!
Dai-sensei... she's too amazing!
I'll have to re-educate her.
Well then, do take care, Eucliwood.
Umm, Dai-sensei.
Y-Yes!
Eu That black mist was...
Huh? All the ingredients I used were from this world!
Onii-chan, these rice balls from the convenience store are very yummy.
I suppose...
It's done, Ayumu!
How difficult did you think it was, changing the trajectory of soap?
Where are the process equations?
1 plus 1 is?
Thank you! Onii-chan is overjoyed!
I'll write it in such a way that it's easy for you to understand!
This is bad.
Is this Ayumu-san?
100 meters in broad daylight.
Ho- Hot! Ho- Hot...
Damn it!
No. No. No. No way man.
Well, it seems like you're fine.
Mama will get mad at me!

Oh, yes! retime plz - Nana
So, who is she?
Her name is Maelstrom.
Jeez! Ayumu, you idiot!
This is our secret base.
I'll give you this.
That doesn't answer my question though.
I'll explain everything from the beginning.
Regarding the Universal String Theory, I don't understand it at all.
I'm not sure, but there are people who want to destroy this device.
You're leaving too?
Regarding that, my superiors will take care of it.
How could that count as marriage?
So, back there, if it were you, would you have been able to avoid it?
If you're talking about Tanabata, then I know it a million times better than you.
pink signI wish the Earth would turn into a boiled egg. By Haruna.
It's now officially your responsibility.
I'm just bringing this for you, that's all.
I'm at fault for not being able to avoid it, no matter what.
Even if you say to me something you'd write in an elementary school essay...
Don't call me that!
She's Yoshida Tomonori from the neighbouring class.
...annoying and creepy.
Also, according to Shakespeare, to climb a hill on a difficult road, you need to be walking steadily.
Honestly, what were you looking at through these glasses?
I'm a zombie, a Masou-Shoujo, and a crude and obscene damn insect.
Did you forget? You were the one who appointed me.
Eromu! Don't look! Stay away!
Onii-chan wasn't thinking about...
You disgust me. To think you'd even invade someone's dream.
I see. C-Can you help me with something then?
I understand already. Let's see...
I-Idiot!
Just as I thought, it has to be that, right?
The way I talk? Is there something wrong with it?
You see, all men fall for gap moe.I think this is just gap moe. Zombie is random like this. Shit makes no sense. -HoloAs you wish -Pipelynx

That's the rule.

Ah, yeah.
Just being friends is enough, isn't it? THE LINE FROM HELL!!! -Aachi
That hurts! What the hell are you doing all of a sudden?!
While we're at it, let's invite Sera and Eu as well.
Don't say stuff like that outside school!
It's OK, isn't it? Since we're a couple.
Ero-Ayumu!
Refused that fast?!
It's not Aikawa, right?
Want me to carry them?
Let's eat!
I can't?
You can't.
Haruna, take care of the stuff.
This one, and then this one.
It can't be helped, it's one of our rules.
Ah! I'll make you a bride as well!
That's why I've revealed myself to you.
What do you mean?
Wasn't your objective to bring Eu back to the ninja village?
That's right.
More importantly, I'm surprised.
If you don't want to do it, then it's okay if you don't, right?
It's not fair to say it like that.
I've heard enough of that.
There's no way I could want to kill her, is there?!
What's with that?
Is that right?
Look at that; your feelings are destabilising again.
Is that a Megalo?
No matter how you look at this, it's wrong!
Haruna!
Weren't you supposed to keep your heart closed?
That you're exceptionally skilled.
I'm going to defeat it!
Aikawa, Seraphim, it'll definitely dissolve! Hurry up!
Damn it! Move! Move! Move!
Releasing magic limiter.
Thank you, Sera!
Break through... Absolute Venril.
Ayumu, why would you stop me?
Vessel malfunction: detected.
A... ikawa. What's happening to me?to me? -masat
You think I can leave you? I can't... Yuki!
Take care on your way back.
Are you hungry? I'll come with you.
If I hadn't been here, today's incident would never have happened.
I was so happy, and accepted those feelings.
If I stay with you as I have been, someone else will suffer.
Don't tell me what I already know, Haruna.
Do you know what "political correctness" is?
It means making sexually discriminate speech sound gender neutral.
A few months have passed since Eu's disappearance.
The old me would have been telling myself,
At least bring in the damn laundry!
The way these fill your stomach is unmatched!
You've been away for so long, but you still treat me like crap.
The one ordering you to kill Eu?
It's very high quality.
No way.
so please take care to interpret their feelings.
Yes, I will.
You're quicker than I thought you were.
It's fine, just stay still.
Uh... That's meant to be used on wood...
Sure. Thank you!
Sorry...
I haven't told anyone else, so you should go first, Aikawa.
We found where she is.
Yikes! I shared some of my Tom Yum soup with someone around there.
You can make that?
You shouldn't be getting up!
Eu...
You came here?
I'm fine.
Don't you think eternity is cruel and boring?
No! No!
What the heck?! Don't give it back to me!
Don't just guess! You have to think about it!
Idiot, idiot, idiot!
I'm the main character! Me!
You abandoned Hellscythe-dono.
Pardon me, is this Aikawa Ayumu-san's residence?
I'm the one who's at fault... because of that, Ayumu-
This time, it's your turn to cast a spell on Aikawa-san.
Disappear! Disappear!
Disappear! Disappear!
Your punishment...
Ah... stop for a second. Let me start over.
I know... It's his doing.
EuIt was peaceful without me there, wasn't it?
EuBut... I always cause problems for you.
Just what do you intend to do?
I've been wanting to see that sorrowful face.
because of this detestable resistance you're putting up.
You're unbelievably cruel, Eucliwood.
The only thing that can seal the gate to the underworld...
Shut up! We're in the middle of something important.
Remember the village.
We'll do that, Ayumu!
Interesting.
Let's do it, Haruna!
Impossible!
600!
Stay by my side, Eu!
Is that selfish?
Yes.
I'm back too!
Having a damn insect see my skin is a disgusting thought.
I'm getting all worked up!
This is just a coincidence, isn't it?
Uh... There's a reason for that...
Ah, this happens a lot. Performing at places like this...
What is this? A new Vampire-Ninja plot?
Huh?
Saraswati!
Huh? This is a mission, then?
Ninjas must change the way they live in each new generation.
Sera, don't you dare look down on the idol industry!
The arrival of a amazing newcomer!
You mustn't be sad. You'll depress everyone who's cheering for her!
I will show you... the world of carnage.
I'm going to lose.
What a gruesome battlefield...
Haruna, too?
A side-job. Wait... This is my main job.
Isn't this noise driving you crazy?
Ayumu! I'm shining right now!
Let's go! Sing along!
Ta-da!
This device... absorbs magic power and puts it into a different person!
I told you that you can't speak while you have Hellscythe-san's magic in you.
You'll be fine if you use Haruna-chan's magic.
Haruna and Eu singing my prayers for your happiness are in the evening sky,
Haruna and Eu With only that, I'm happy.
In this moment of happiness, we can just watch and enjoy...
I thought these peaceful days would last forever.
You can buy me lunch.
...a Manchu Han imperial feast.
Hurry and make me some dinner.
Huh? What're you talking about?
Huh?
I'll defeat the enemy to avenge you, so just rest in peace.
Secret Technique!
I still have the same feelings as humans though.
Haruna-chan!
Right now!
Why are you a magicalfscx300-
You...
"I see?"
Should I just think of her as a noisy stray cat staying with me?
No human can have this much power!
Human bodies have a limit that prevents them from using 100 of their power. Humans... their bodies have a limit and therefore cannot use 100 of their power.
But, I...
Shoujo? There's no way I can turn into a girl!
It's coming...
And 10 million times the defence!
That's wicked, Aikawa...
Stop it!
Thank goodness.
Oh, and I'm also a Masou-Shoujo.
and erase the memories of those who saw me.
It's been a week since then.
I'd like some different side dishes for tomorrow.Better if "for" is removed, please check. -sm
Give me a break.
He's taken this joke too far...As you'd expect, that idiot went too far.I don't like this line. I think the CR one was better
Everyone! Aikawa's bento is amazing!
It's because I'm a genius, right?
I'm hungry.
Sure thing.
I'll make dinner soon.
Ms. Miso soup? Well, can be Miso soup-san too. Please double check this. -sm
So who is this?
A foreigner?!
You came from an unexpected place.
Please, call me Sera.
Let's go somewhere without people.
Sera-san, was it?
My specialityspecial technique is the Swallow Reversal Technique.I'm good at the Swallow Reversal Technique.
Swallow Reversal Technique!
Eight Slashes!
I have been defeated.
You plan on staying here?!
So, let me be by your side, Hellscythe-dono.
Master, it's morning.
Really?
What's that?
No matter how I look, a mysterious idiot.
What am I doing?
Damn.
Ah, fine, fine.
I want more miso soup.
Sera-san, you've completely made yourself at home...
I don't think anything would happen over one or two days.
Die! Idiot!
After all, I'm a ninja.
Shall I turn you into a Vampire-Ninja, too?
Mystletainn Kick!
That's definitely not a kick!
I'll take care of you scrumptiously!
there's good weather today.
There were two tickets. Could this be fate?
So this means I win, right?
But if I recall, this game is decided by losing.
Who would've thought you had that up your sleeve?
I've been meaning to ask... Why are you staying here?
Eh? Masked set?
The clerks recommended it very passionately, so...
If it means he'll be saved, then...
My desire.
It's seorita.
Eh? Hey.
You replied without a second thought?!
For you to be hiding things from me...
So...
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
Are you okay?
I'm jealous!
Aikawa!
No, more like, 1 in 100,000,000 chance something like that happened,
I'd be treated like a sandbag.
Huh?
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.
No, it's totally fine.
Yeah.
I'll put those flowers in a vase for you.
Um, sorry for bringing this up,
About the culprit who killed my dad and mum!
A wooden sword?
It can't be. Could the culprit be...
You're pretty good, leaf lady.
More.
Eh?
It's a mystery to me, too.
Eat this...?!
What else is there? Would you like to chew on a shoe instead?
There's no pulse.
I'm hungry, Onii-chan!
As I was saying, this dishfscx300-
Is it something that has a physical structure?
U-Um... Are you the pizza boy?
I'm a guardian of the underworld.
Ayumu?
Eucliwood Hellscythe-sama.
Take care of Hellscythe-sama...
I see.
That's just...
Eu. It's all right to smile when you want to smile.
Is it all right for me to stay with you?
 I'm with you. Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Bring it on!
Please don't cause unwanted damage with your reckless actions,
It's possible.
Nomobuyo,
It won't hurt.
You're a damn despicable insect, aren't you?
You'll die if you don't suck blood regularly?
That was something similar to an anaesthetic.
Don't open the door! Idiot!
She can't seem to find it, so it's fine.
but there's no Kyotofu from Kyoto in Tokyo.
Ah, but recently, something unexpected happened.
While the sun is up, the vitality and stamina of a zombie is equivalent to a three year old.
I'm really happy that you asked me for help.
May I volunteer for the position?
Aikawa-san's...
That's just... Even your own family?
I just happened to manipulate their memories a bit, like Orito-san's.
I wonder why.
Immobilised with just one magical barrier, and you intend...
Haruna.
Why does she have the same magic powers as a Megalo?
He's shining. Ayumu is shining right now!
How does it feel to be defeated by a pervert?
I told you this was two versus one, didn't I?
That was quite a lovely dress power up, despite it being you.
You're a zombie?!
Hello, thank you for taking care of our Haruna.
Even though it's my Mystletainn...
And that's... Eu, it was you?
Bound to a boring town...
I want those incredible powers.
100!
Go home.
 Die
I want to beat the crap out of her!
That's probably because you actually care about Eu.
I've fully regenerated now.
She's even more of a zombie than me.
Are you stupid?
Huh?
I have the artefact of life!
Then resurrect and show me!
That's right.
Full Course.
For the time being, I'll take this girl back with me.
I don't plan on doing anything yet.
Well then, see you.
Most people go about their days without realising it,
That's what I should be saying!
But he was consumed by malice,
Could it be that you two were lovers or something?
Look, I'm immortal, even though it's because of your powers.
Haruna and Sera are here, too.
My new fried eggs.
No, I'm going to eat it though.
Magic power: one gigaton.
As you can see, I don't want to go to school during summer for the make-up work.
That's why the spiral galaxy spins round and round like this.
That's what gave birth to the string theory.
S-Sorry...
Geez, where am I supposed to go?
This is bad.
Sera? Hey, can you sense the presence of Megalo?
Actually, I have a favour I need to ask of you. Actually, I have a favour I need to ask from Ayumu-san.
It's fragile, so please handle it with care, all right?
Hot... Ho... H... Ho...
As I expected, this is impossible!
Damn it!
You look delicious!
Get here faster!
Take this!
Yes! Ah yes! Come on!
You're already attacking?!
That hurts! Seraphim!
Yeah, something like that.
It's none of your concern!
I should be the one asking you that!
Don't ignore me!
Here, huh?
The thickness of this soup is unmatched.
Then why are you giving it to me?
Man, this really is delicious.
Also, you can have more if you want, all right?
I see, that's fine then.
You two are now married.
So, back there, if it were you, would you have been able to avoid it?
That's still kind of impossible.
When the river in the sky flows, following two beasts, the legendary man appears.
Then this deadly Santa Claus grants a wish only to the human wearing a ponytail.
Let all the disgusting things in this world begone such as zombies. By Sera.
Hey, hey, Onii-chan! What did you write? Eu wants to know!
Yes, that's me.
Hm, Dai-sensei's?
Y-You...
No! To us, that incident was not something minor!
I've made up my mind, from that moment henceforth!
Geez, to think someone like this is my husband.
Orito! You know her?
Don't call me that, damn it!
Oh, I made a mistake.
I'm a zombie, a Masou-Shoujo, and a crude and obscene damn insect.
And to prove it... look.
Cuter than Eu, cuter than Sera, cuter than anyone in the world.
Onii-chan wasn't thinking about...
All right!
I wonder if he started a dark seaweed boom.
Keep your voice down, Kanami! This is embarrassing!
It has to be handmade food, right?
But the food Aikawa gets at home is pretty damn good.
You think so?
Yuki has fallen for you, Ayumu-kun...
Kyun
No, no, you have your charms.
Y-Yeah.
Like I said...
Aikawa! Let's go home together!
Y-Yeah, it's the same direction until halfway.
Is it like a real ninja mansionfscx300-
Yuki-chan?
Say, Tomonori?
Don't keep saying that you're my wife or whatever...
So my feelings have nothing to do with it?
That's the rule.
Ah, yeah.
Since we're not really married or living together,
Kids nowadays are so daring.
Haruna?!
Ah, sure.
Though, my face has turned red!
Don't say stuff like that outside school!
It's okay, isn't it? Since we're a couple.
Refused that fast?!
Nyaa
Hungry.
Let's eat!
Like I said, that was an accident!
Aikawa! Let's have a battle!
That's a procedure necessary for sucking blood.
Haruna.
What an unfortunate coincidence,
I'm the type that devotes herself to someone.
Ah! I'll turn you into a bride, too!
I definitely disappeared at that time, but I wasn't destroyed entirely.
So you're going to kill Eu?
I'm a ninja.
You don't understand the importance of having a mission.
Is Eu's life less important than your mission?
Which is it?!
Will you kill her? Or won't you?!
Seriously?!
Yeah.
Don't screw with me!
Keep trying!
If I recall, you were a teacher at the Matelis Magic Academy.
No, that's nothing special.
Superior power confirmed.
Releasing magic limiter.
First echelon confirmed.
Second echelon confirmed.
Eh? Why?
Whatever. Just hurry up and transform.
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal.
You might call her the sister of an old friend.
When something like this happens...?
We don't have a choice.
You can't.
It's one of our laws.
Do you not recognise us?
I'm all right. I'm a zombie after all.
30 seconds until self-destruct activation.
Aikawa... get away from here.
He's well done, isn't he?
Really? Don't stay out too late, then.
I was so happy and accepted those feelings.
At least bring in the damn laundry!
You'll have some too, right?
What are you doing, sissy-Ayumu?
What about you?
I haven't heard a thing, either.
Leaf lady, are you all right?!
I was a fool.
thinking they would know something about Hellscythe-dono, but...
That makes me feel even more sick than bathing in the perspiration left on the bath cover from the day before.
You disgust me.
S-Sorry!
So, will you play some for us?
Animals can't speak our language,
I'll take care of him.
What... was that just now?
and finish these two off.
Shut the hell up! I've decided to see her again while I'm still alive.
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't allow myself to be caught,
Load it on. Load it all on!
Great! It's finished.
You're heavy!
Thank you, Tomonori.
Y-You don't need to thank me.
Wait, idiot-Ayumu!
I knew you'd come here.
Sera! Sera!
Hellscythe-dono was in front of your house just now!
Eu...
How about we eat together?
Seconds, seconds, seconds!
Can't you wait till we're done eating?Can't you wait until after eating to talk about that?
Thank you!
but don't you think eternity is cruel and boring?
That's because she doesn't want to stay with you.
Haruna!
What is it?
Eu...
Eu!
Hey, we don't have time to be playing around!
I guess I'll try.
Stop!
Don't just guess! You have to think about it!
Eu...
I suppose there is no other option.
What a beautifully dim sky, Eucliwood.
I'm... weak?
You really are a damn despicable insect.
Just rot here forever, Aikawa.
What are you doing, idiot-Ayumu?
Just what do you intend to do?
because of the detestable resistance you're putting up.
In other words, it's up to you, Seraphim.
To all wandering souls... I give peace.
No way...
Do you know what kind of face she makes when she's having fun?!
Do you know what Eu's favourite foods are?!
Please...
I love penguins.
Do you intend to go elsewhere again?
That's why I'm pushing you!
If I had my wish, I would like to stay with Ayumu. - Eu.
I'm back.
Whoa! The Necromancer spoke!
Right?
We've been invited to Yggdrasil!
I never thought we'd be able to converse with Eu like this.
"I love Onii-chan," right?!
My luck of the draw is amazing!
Even though I'm a zombie.
Did you purchase tickets for the last lottery?
Stop showing off!
Ah, Eu...
I'm being watched...
Ah! Aikawa!
Isn't it just coincidence?This is just a coincidence, isn't it?
Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you.
Uh... There's a reason for that...
Well, that much trouble is nothing to worry about.
You damn insect...
Kirara-tan! Strike me down!
Oh, Aikawa!
What are you going to do? Why not pretend you didn't see it and...
Huh?
What do you think you're doing?
It is true that I am a woman that lives in shadow.
I can't believe that Sera-san was really an idol...
It is a vicious world where the strong devour the weak.
Wait! Wait a sec!
What, you're finally on stage, and now you're afraid?
Stop this at once!
Why did things turn out this way...?
Sera, you've described my activity of being an idol as a farce.
Child's play, self-satisfaction, lies, exaggeration, and ambiguousness.
She's showing us something amazing. Just going with the flow.
Well, this didn't happen because I necessarily wanted it to.
No!
What a dreadful girl.
Ayumu! I'm shining right now!
Why did it come to this?
Eh?
That's...
...as a human.
Everyone probably went there.
It's kind of lonely.
Is everybody ready?!
Tomonori, what are you doing here?
As if I'll lose!
You're cooling it down.
Don't worry about me... Just go.
Why did you agree to become the prize yourself?
Damn, I'll just get up there using my arms as well!
Secret Technique: Swallow Reversal!
Eroticism!erosa
I see! The explosion must have given him a shot of adrenaline!Nana: tbh I'm confused with the eng word so might want to reconfirm it.
It's impossible.
Wasshoi!
His summer break came to an end after the festival.
Aikawa!
Take good care of it.
No... yes.
See you!
I might see them!
Honestly, I agree.
We're missing eye drops as an ingredient.
As far as I know,
I guess I really should have added some carbonate.
Right now, we're searching for the thing that's hidden in the dark realm of innocence.
I want it very much!Your life is pitiful.--Paw
"You go ahead first!"
"I have...""...a bad feeling about this." "Turn the ship around." "Yeah, I think you're right. Full reverse. Chewie, lock in the auxilliary power." I could go on and on....--Paw
A foot?!
This isn't good, Aikawa.
Looks like this is it for me!
"After this, please read this letter..."
The unexpected outcome: these three,
"A slight difference in tactics..."Original TL said "real battle," not "tactics." What the hell is "real battle"?--Paw
Thanks.
Ah, you flatter me!

Thanks for your support last season.
Here!
These kind of attractions really make the pool fun.
I know.
and make it an L size?
Man, you and Sera.
This pool is connected to Loch Ness.
Fine, then!
Man, that Haruna.
Don't you dare try to escape!
You're a disgusting worm who crawled out of a rotten watermelon!
He was taking pictures of girls in their swimsuits.
Why?!
Huh? Ayumu, what are you doing?
Let me out already.
I don't...actually...
Eu?
Yes.
I'd like to throw a surprise party.
Heard your little chat.
Don't you dare ignore me!
All right!
Aikawa! She's being mean!
an8You have no right to be saying that!
I see.
Like I would fall for that.
an8Right again.
Don't wear panties.
Okay, present time!
Orito! You're the worst!
You never seem to use anything but teacups, so I figured it'd be nice for tea and coffee.
I'll take you to the nurse's office.
I still want to puke.
I couldn't accept something as unscientific as ghosts.
Ayumu, you have hallucinations? Awesome!
Yuki-chan's trying her best, isn't she?
Well, they act more like husband and wife, so it's sort of refreshing.
Sounds like he has it made.
Would you put all those bottles away?
But my cooking is nothing without these condiments.
Huh?
Heh, I can't let a kid drink!
You were chosen by Gaia!
the graveyard sounds ridiculous!
Right, Aikawa-kun?
The Masou Shoujo who leapt over the world,
You really did get your powers back.
Haruna!
But Hiramatsu and the others are watching!
Fine.
It's coming... it's coming... it's coming...
Isn't he the guy from the magazine cover?
Aikawa... was the deviant!
I knew it!
Dude, you were for real?!
He's cross-dressing and holding a real chainsaw! What's wrong with him?
Isn't that going too far?
I saw what was under his skirt. Aren't those panties?
Stop it! Don't get any cuter than that!
He's sparkling!
Ayumu's sparkling!
T-Thank you...
Don't look at me!
I wasn't able to confirm it through his clothes,
I'll just have to accept it and embrace it.
Yep! Yep!
I've come to the conclusion that you are indeed, pretty cool.
That might not be a bad idea.
Besides, Tomonori said that...
Mother Nature is great!
Hmm.
Hey, Aikawa!
I know that!
Thank you.
if you insist on returning the favor,
What did you say?
Eh?
A bear's chasing us!
I still can't see!
What...
Yes, just the thought makes me upset.
Although the unchanging starry sky is beautiful.
Welcome, new me!
Goodbye to you to, new me.
Could I get your autograph?
Hmph!
Everyone only treats me differently because of the nudity incident!
Aikawa-san, I'm sorry.
Eh?
I'm home!
The Ayumu Buttocks Festival is a hit!
Hey, what do you think about Onii-chan being a Masou Shoujo?
What's so cool about that dung beetle?
His butt...
What's that?
I see.
She's saying the same thing as Haruna.
Don't!
Does it feel good here?
Then how about here?
While you're taking it easy...
so eat them when you're free.
It'll finally be over when everyone's memories of me being a Masou-shoujo are finally erased.
You were the one who asked for this.
That's what being a man is all about!
I'm beat.
Even though it's logical,
Orito is trying to face reality at this moment.
What on earth should I do?
But for flower viewing, I'll choose Shch instead.
C-Can't breathe!
No, I just want to do it once...
What good point? Look at what you've done!
No!
Bad people are goners,
See? Dance is something like this.
It can't be helped.
Listen, Mael Strom.
If you can't do that, then I'll have you return to the village.
Listen, Yukinori!
How are you doing?
Now or never.
We'll somehow perfect it before the real show tonight.
We were.
A hobby fit only for men!
They're just toys from robot animes.
This is why older women
Okay...
Awesome!
Ayumu, are you gonna get a Demon Baron too?
Not Full Metal, it's the hero from Villier!
If you walk along a certain back road in the shopping district...
Once you see hot girls cosplaying, you'll never crossdress again.
Get out, master!
Get out!
Hey, Saras.
What the heck are you doing?
Another one of your stupid ideas?
We raise it through activities such as this.
Kirara-tan!
Her legs are truly gorgeous.
Isn't she wearing panties or something over them?
I did notice that you left the house occasionally.
You sure have a nice body, Sera-san.
Yes.
Huh?
I don't get it, but I have to say it.
Orito.
I mean, filthy swine.
Let the banquet of hell commence!
What?
I don't think you have to try so hard.
Aikawa, you don't like this?
Well, I have different tastes,
Right!
You worthless insects have no right to live!
This restaurant has some fine talent.
Order something already!
5-4-3-2-1!
Hey.
Can we get some more water for now?
Hey, are you alright?
I-I'll get it for you!
Drink! I'm the one serving here.
Seraphim the Tsun will be serving you!
Taste its might.
My eardrums are cramping just from hearing your voice!
Please silence yourself, you worthless insect.
Please.
S-Seconds, please.
What a gruesome battle.
I have a secret weapon whom I recruited just for today.
Um, hello there.
What a high-level battle!
Huh? We won?
I won't ever wash this hand of mine!
Eucliwood.
This isn't something I'd do.
They had to call us back suddenly just to take our measurements.
Too many crises pop up in that city.
It tickles!
Yes!
Haruna, go get something to cool her off.
Sage mode.
i1I can do it!
I got some ice.
Hmm?
an8Aikawa?
an8Fever?
This ain't workin',
Why are you on a perverted-act spree?
Huh?!
an8You just need to let her rest now.
You shouldn't have done that, though.
I-I'm like her older sister, so it's only natural!
You're not mad?
Oh...
Excuse me.
In that case, she must have missed some.
Come to think of it, if people from the underworld eat the forbidden fruit,
Well, I do have an idea.
If I remember correctly, you have to drink tea out of a spinning cup.
There's a limit to desperate measures!
What's that supposed to be a cure for?!
If she thinks so too,
Then you eat spinach while holding CDs with both armpits.
Huh?
So, what was the cure?
Only those from the underworld can catch that disease.
H-Hey, you don't need to...
i1She was really tired too,
Welcome back.
Now, let it cool down so it'll be easier to eat.
A haunted cafe.
It'll be great.
It's settled, then.
There was only one more day left until the cultural festival when I realized it.
Ayumu.
Huh?
Is this what Dracula's cape looks like?
Hiramatsu.
Yeah, I guess.
And this...
Shut up, Ayumu! Don't get in my way!
I am! It's a bra top!
That sounds good.
The feeling of being saved by a comrade who fought at your side
That hit the spot!
Wine in...
I thought you could use a helping hand.
Would you like my help?
Let's see...
Yes, sir.
Let's go home.
I-I can't wait for tomorrow.
This is what you call youth!
I'll be back!
I'll be back!
Mystletainn-sensei!
I can face tomorrow's festival with a clean reputation!
Gaia! Universe!
This is the first time I've seen such good cross-dressing.
To my booth.
Yukinori!
an8Cha Cha Cha Cha, what is this cha cha?
an8Nee-san, that's dangerous...
Please vanish, walking disruption.
No.
T-T-Thanks for coming here with me.
I have something else I have to tell you.
Some rumors say that if you confess here, you have a good chance of getting a good reply.
it feels like one of us is about to confess.
Confirming irregularities in the body.
The ring?
No, on her!
Tomonori!
Tomonori, you're awake!
Let's transform together.
Noooo!
This is arousing!
This is arousing!
Yeah!
No.
Everything is according to the String Theory,
Who?
Oh yeah.
Okay.
That's a shame. You looked cute in it.
I see you're still wearing it.
Um, you see,
Ayumu, aren't you going to fantasize about me today?
W-What ever could you mean?
Codename Buttrip.
We're going to look around.
Hm.
i1Thank you, Miss Fairy.
This is youth, huh?
Why did I have to end up holding hands with my teacher on the last day of the festival?
living at your house who makes lunch for you every day.
Huh?
There's also a sexy older lady who does the cleaning and laundry.
On top of that, you have another cute girl who's the little-sister type who lets you fantasize about her.
No!
How do you know that?!
Falling down just because of an influx of mana.
I would've bit my tongue and killed myself already!
Do you actually believe that?!
Oh no! What's going on?
Aikawa, I knew you were a pedophile.
Hiramatsu!
I don't want to.
No, you can't!
Why don't you try making me do it?
Let's talk about how much it bugs us here!this shouldn't overlap
Have more delusions!
Ah, the real one came out!
Kyouko-chan?
Friends or not, everything started when you killed me.
Don't look at me like you hate me.
I've reflected on my actions already in solitary confinement.
So, who are you?
I see.
You're taking me out for an evening date, aren't you?
I'm looking forward to it.
Will you listen to my wish?
The festival was fun!
A mixer?
Dontcha wanna get down and partay wit da bitches and da hos?
Let's have fun!
Are you feeling well?
I-I'm doing this for you, though.
Well, it is for free.
You're quite the boring woman.
I simply follow my orders.
Hmm, looks like I'm right.
A mixer?
Go and have fun.
Another form of butt-love.
Looks like we're a few boys short.
Play "Who's the King?" with me!
If you act like that, I'm gonna get nervous too.
God, help me!
So this is the king's game...
Wow, this is hot.
Dai-sensei!
A flash of inspiration! A great flash of inspiration!
Hey, four-eyes!
Die-san.
That's not my intention at all.
Kyouko-chan.
Mixers just aren't my thing.
So that's why you brought me here.
I'll never be in anyone's memories.
my sentence.
Will you still remember me even then?
Those who don't listen to the king have to be punished.
No, this is an abuse of power!
Who is the king?
But if it's really that incredible, why didn't it make you sit up?
You're so behind the times.
What?
I see.
I've been looking for you, my darling.
Then, I'll take that instead.
H-Hello?
My real name sounds too stiff.
She went back to sleep!
Huh? I'm listening, I'm listening.
There's no way she'll finish all that, even with me helping.
This is dangerous.
Ah!
Did you buy my food?
I-I-It's hot!
Asleep again?!
Coming!
Oh, Saras? Sorry.
Is something wrong?
I still remember. It's tomorrow night, right?
Don't worry. I keep it on me at all times.
I hate beating around the bush, so I'll cut to the chase.
Ah!
That's right.
Because I've created a masterpiece that would surprise even the kettles of hell.
Yeah, I promise. I'll be there.
I still ended up causing her trouble because of that promise.
He's interesting.
Wow! So obscene yet platonic!
I don't even need to read the inside to satisfy myself!
More, more!
She's so cute.
Yes.
You're going to be a teacher too?
I see...
Okay, now put the eggs in the beaker.
Woah perverted slime!
This guy sure is a gentleman.
Taeko!
